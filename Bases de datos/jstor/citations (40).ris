AB  - IF COMPETING GEOSPATIAL PHILOSOPHIES OF nationality and nationalism underpin many elements of digital text transmission, as explored in the preceding chapter, it is perhaps unsurprising that spatial elements of directionality and dimensionality (which are central to the spatialities of geopolitics) are also key to many metaphors in the computational world. Our supposed path of web browsing, for instance, is confined to the two-dimensional metaphors of a linear timeline: forward and backward. We also have <em>home</em> pages, but “home” refers to the start of a line of text, as well as the starting screens that users may customize within their browsers.

AB  - ABSTRACT. We present a summary of what is currently known about the three distinct families of isolated pulsating white dwarfs. These are the GW&#xa0;Vir stars (He/C/O-atmosphere stars with Teff&#xa0;&#x2243;&#xa0;120,000&#xa0;K T eff &#x2243; 120 , 000 &#x2009; &#x2009; K ), the V777&#xa0;Her stars (He-atmosphere, Teff&#xa0;&#x2243;&#xa0;25,000&#xa0;K T eff &#x2243; 25 , 000 &#x2009; &#x2009; K ), and the ZZ&#xa0;Ceti stars (H-atmosphere, Teff&#xa0;&#x2243;&#xa0;12,000&#xa0;K T eff &#x2243; 12 , 000 &#x2009; &#x2009; K ), all showing multiperiodic luminosity variations caused by low-order and low-degree g g -mode instabilities. We also provide, in an Appendix, a very brief overview of the newly found evidence in favor of the existence of a fourth category of oscillating white dwarfs bearing strong similarities with these families of pulsators. We begin our survey with a short historical introduction, followed by a general discussion of pulsating white dwarfs as compact pulsators. We then discuss the class properties of these objects, including an updated census. We next focus on the instability domains for each family of pulsators in the log&#xa0;g&#xa0;-&#xa0;Teff log g - T eff diagram, and present their time-averaged properties in more detail. This is followed by a section on excitation physics, i.e., the causes of the pulsational instabilities, with emphasis on the common properties of the different types of pulsator. We then discuss the time-dependent properties of the pulsating white dwarfs featuring, among other things, a brief &#x201c;picture tour&#x201d; across the ZZ&#xa0;Ceti instability strip. We next review the methods used to infer or constrain the angular geometry of a pulsation mode in a white dwarf. These include multicolor photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy, the exploitation of the nonlinear features in the observed light curves, and rotational splitting. We also consider basic adiabatic asteroseismology starting with a discussion of the reaction of the period spectrum to variations of model parameters. We next review the various asteroseismological inferences that have so far been claimed for white dwarfs. We also discuss the potential of exploiting the rates of period change. We finally provide some concluding remarks, including a list with several suggestions for future progress in the field.

AB  - [Increasingly, students use the internet for self-directed learning in higher education, requiring them to develop skills to determine which information is reliable and accurate. Although the need to understand, evaluate, and promote such skills is crucial, little is known about the students’ search for and use of online sources (and the key influences of those sources) in higher education. Current research indicates both that students need specific skills to successfully engage and learn with online materials, and that university practitioners need to rethink their curricula and instructional approaches for online teaching in the age of ChatGPT and other AI-supported tools. Interdisciplinary theoretical and empirical methods can help us gain a deeper understanding of how students develop the various skills required for successful online learning, and how we can support them across domains.]

AB  - [In the modern military’s highly interconnected and technology-reliant operational environment, cybersecurity is rapidly growing in importance. Moreover, as a number of highly publicized attacks have occurred against complex cyber-physical systems such as automobiles and airplanes, cybersecurity is no longer limited to traditional computer systems and IT networks. While architectural analysis approaches are critical to improving cybersecurity, these approaches are often poorly understood and applied in ad hoc fashion. This work addresses these gaps by answering the questions: 1. “What is cybersecurity architectural analysis?” and 2. “How can architectural analysis be used to more effectively support cybersecurity decision making for complex cyber-physical systems?” First, a readily understandable description of key architectural concepts and definitions is provided which culminates in a working definition of “cybersecurity architectural analysis,” since none is available in the literature. Next, we survey several architectural analysis approaches to provide the reader with an understanding of the various approaches being used across government and industry. Based on our proposed definition, the previously introduced key concepts, and our survey results, we establish desirable characteristics for evaluating cybersecurity architectural analysis approaches. Lastly, each of the surveyed approaches is assessed against the characteristics and areas of future work are identified.]

AB  - [Recent experimental measurements of fluorescence values and turbulent energy dissipation rates, recorded in weakly stratified boundary layers in the open ocean, have highlighted a significant correlation between the formation of deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) and turbulent mixing. Specifically, the depth of many DCM are observed to lie below, but within about one standard deviation, of the point at which the energy dissipation rate profile reaches its maximum. This correlation of DCM and turbulent mixing is both exciting and curious, as conventional thinking tends to see the latter as a destructive rather than a constructive agent in regards to the formation of deep biological maxima (DBM), for which DCM data is usually interpreted as a proxy. In order to investigate this phenomenon, a three-dimensional large eddy simulation (LES) of the ocean boundary layer was combined with a generic nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) type biological model, in order establish what mechanisms might be driving the experimental observations. Simulations of the LES-NPZ model, based upon various sets of generic biological parameters, demonstrate DCM/DBM formation occurs at normalized depths close to those seen in the experimental observations. The simulations support the hypothesis that the DBM are generated by a combination of zooplankton predation pressure curtailing phytoplankton growth near the surface, and a decline in the strength of the vertical mixing processes advecting nutrient through the boundary layer. In tandem, these produce a region of the water column in which predation pressure is relatively low and nutrient aggregation relatively high, suitable conditions for DBM formation.]

Here, in contrast to our view, Meillassoux wants to show metaphysically that all of reality is a hyper-chaos. For us, on the contrary, chaos is itself only truly enacted as pseudo-randomness, as the chaos that is founded on rules. Chaos is like possibility; it is founded on something actual and ordered. We then project disorder on its basis, since almost everything we encounter is ordered. Whereas Meillassoux is saying anything can happen at anytime, a pan-ontic computationalist approach says that all that appears is based on iteration

AB  - What is considered environmentally ‘valuable’ varies enormously from place to place, and from time to time, but some common denominators can be identified. A landscape assessment for the Wanganui District¹ of the north island of New Zealand, for example, puts the emphasis on memory and affect: ‘A landscape becomes memorable when the image perceived by the viewer remains with them after they leave the site’. The capacity of a place, landscape or site to influence a visitor emotionally – and the durability of that affect – leaves the most ‘valuable’ legacy, both in economic and personal terms: it is the private memory

From the point of view of culture, this means they are persons capable of contributing to culture in their families and communities. The development of this view in the research community is parallel with the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child from 1989 and is part of the same intellectual current.² Moreover, research about infants’ cognitive and communicative capacities from the late 20th and early 21st centuries has

AB  - [Aim: We propose a novel approach that considers taxonomic uniqueness, functional uniqueness and environmental uniqueness and show how it can be used in guiding conservation planning. We illustrate the approach using data for lake biota and environment. Location: Lake Puruvesi, Finland. Methods: We sampled macrophytes and macroinvertebrates from the same 18 littoral sites. By adapting the original “ecological uniqueness” approach, we used distance-based methods to calculate measures of taxonomic (LCBD–t), functional (LCBD–f) and environmental (LCEH) uniqueness for each site. We also considered the numbers and locations of the sites needed to protect up to 70% of total variation in taxonomic, functional or environmental features in the studied part of the lake. Results: Relationships between taxonomic (LCBD–t), functional (LCBD–f) and environmental (LCEH) uniqueness were generally weak, and only the relationship between macrophyte LCBD–t and LCBD–f was statistically significant. Overall, however, if the whole biotic dataset was considered, macroinvertebrate LCBD–f values showed a consistent positive relationship with macrophyte LCBD–f. Depending on the measure of site uniqueness, between one-third to one half of the sites could help protect up to 70% of the ecological uniqueness of the studied part of Lake Puruvesi. Main conclusions: Although the dataset examined originated from a large lake system, the approach we proposed here can be applied in different ecosystems and at various spatial scales. An important consideration is that a set of sites has been sampled using the same methods, resulting in species and environmental matrices that can be analysed using the methodological approach proposed here. This framework can be easily applied to grid-based data, sets of islands or sets of forest fragments. We suggest that the approach based on taxonomic, functional and environmental uniqueness will be a useful tool in guiding nature conservation and ecosystem management, especially if associated with meta-system ideas or network thinking.]

AB  - [Subjective walkability is a measure of the perceived friendliness of walking in an area. Though subjective walkability is less commonly assessed than objective measurements, the latter often fail to reflect the experience of walking. This study aims to better understand subjective walkability and how it varies between travel and leisure walking by investigating its relationship with the built environment and land-use characteristics. Data is collected from 848 street segments in Montreal, Canada, using the MAPS-mini audit tool, external measurements including Walkscore as well as synthetic subjective walkability scores. Mixed effect multilevel models are then generated using travel and leisure subjective walkability scores as dependent variables and built environment features as independent variables. Statistically significant positive predictors of perceived walkability differ between walking for travel and walking for leisure. Walkscore is found to have a weak but significant effect on perceived walkability for travel but no effect at all for leisure. Based on this research, a multi-scalar approach both at the street and neighborhood level making use of a combination of objective and subjective walkability measures should be employed to study predictors of walking behavior. Lastly, distinctions of walking behaviors based on trip purpose should be integrated in future research.]

AB  - [The COVID-19 pandemic had a serious impact on developing various psychological stressors in society. Grounded in cognitive appraisal theory, the current study has been conducted to investigate the moderating role of Hindu religious coping in mitigating the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 in developing perceived stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among the Hindu residents in Bali, Indonesia. The current study contributed to the body of knowledge regarding religious practices acting as a coping mechanism to help the community cope with crises scenario such as COVID-19. Using a longitudinal field survey, data were collected at two different times from 423 Hinduism believers who actively practiced religion and lived in Bali, Indonesia. Data were analyzed using measurement and structural models in SmartPLS. Results revealed that the perceived threat of COVID-19 impacted a higher level of stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among the target sample. Results further depicted that the intensity of the perceived threat of COVID-19 to develop negative stressors among those individuals is low who believe in Hinduism and practice religious obligations on a regular basis. This reflects the moderating role of Hindu religious coping in decreasing stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among Hindu believers aimed at COVID-19.]

Why is common sense so trivial for humans but so hard for machines? In this essay, I map the twists and turns in recent research adventures toward commonsense AI. As we will see, the latest advances on common sense are riddled with new, potentially counterintuitive perspectives and questions. In particular, I discuss the significance of language for modeling intuitive reasoning, the fundamental limitations of logic formalisms despite their intellectual appeal, the case for on-thefly generative reasoning through language, the continuum between knowledge and reasoning, and the blend between symbolic and neural knowledge representations.]

AB  - Since around 2012, machine learning based on artificial neural networks (ANN) has become the dominant paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) research and increasingly determines the technological and infrastructural conditions of contemporary computer culture. Whether new developments in the field of text, speech, or image recognition, whether concrete use cases such as self-driving cars, virtual avatars, or medical diagnostic systems, the list of innovations that involves ANN-based machine learning is extremely long. Although some scholars emphasize the epistemological limits of ANN, it is nevertheless surprising to see how, since very recently, they became such a powerful technology of prediction, capable of

And while journalists worry that thinking about, talking about, strategizing for and measuring the positive (and negative) impact of their work will get too close to crossing the red line from journalism into advocacy, practitioners and commentators alike have spent many column inches and pixels hand-wringing about the negative effects of “fake news,” misinformation and partisan reporting on individuals, our

AU  - Merli, M. Giovanna

AB  - [Much of what we know about the intellectual landscape of anglophone demography comes from two sources: subjective narratives authored by leaders in the field, whose reviews and observations are derived from their research experience and field-specific knowledge; and professional histories covering the field’s foundational controversies, which tend to focus on individuals, institutions, and influence. Here we use bibliographic information from all articles published in the three leading journals of anglophone demography—Demography, Population Studies, and Population and Development Review—to survey the changing contours of anglophone demography’s key research areas over the past 70 years. We characterize the field of demography by applying a two-pronged, data-grounded approach from the sociology of science. The first uses natural language processing that lets the substance of the field emerge from the conlents of publication records and applies social network analyses to identify groups of papers that talk about the same thing. The second uses bibliometric tools to capture the “conversations” of demography with other disciplines. Our goals are to (1) identify the primary topics of demography since the discipline first gained prominence as an organized field; (2) assess changes in the field’s intellectual cohesion and the topical areas that have grown or shrunk; and (3) examine how demographers place their work in relationship to other disciplines, the visibility and influence of demographic research in the broader scientific literature, and the cross-disciplinary translational reach of demographic research. Results provide a dynamic view of the field’s scientific development in the second half of the twentieth century and the first two decades of the twenty-first century.]

TI  - Unveiling the Veil

AB  - [This study examined the current knowledge of Filipino college students on the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of the Philippines. The study included 75 college students during the academic year 2022-2023. Through a qualitative approach, the students submitted written essays anchored to the research questions. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative data, adhering to the stages of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The analysis resulted in the surfacing of various themes which are the result of this study: (1) Exposure to art forms, (2) association with indigenous people, (3) essence of values and practices, (4) misunderstandings about ICH, and (5) safeguarding of ICH. Students who came from the provinces experienced ICH through their festivities and local cultures, which are annual celebrations of various communities. There were also students who observed their locality’s people, handicrafts, and even familial behaviors. The presence of various art forms, performances, and experiences with indigenous peoples, and local traditions, regardless of whether it is within their families or communities, and their own knowledge of recent social issues unveiled the opportunities for the students to be exposed to the concept of Intangible Cultural Heritage and safeguard it. The author proposed a recommendation to further study and formulate a probable teaching and learning approach for college students to be more exposed to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Philippines.]

AB  - In van der Hulst (2010) I suggested that a case can be made for recursion in syllable structure, a proposal that develops a suggestion in Smith (1999; 2003) and other work. This idea runs counter to the usual statement that there are no ‘syllables inside syllables’, or that phonology at large is not recursive, except where it copies recursive syntactic structure. In van der Hulst (2010; 2020) I focus on recursion in the rhyme of the syllable, which allows embedded syllables, to capture trochaic and dactylic feet. In this chapter, I explore recursion in the onset, which will be justified

Whether executive, legislative, or judicial, governmental actors at some level are put in place by, and thus act in response to, a voting population who desire responsiveness from their representatives. One of the primary methods of delivering on this representational arrangement is in the form of policymaking, where governmental actors offer policies aimed at correcting or addressing issues in society (Jones et al., 2009). While there are a host of avenues for policymakers to be made aware of pressing societal issues requiring policy action at some level (Waggoner, 2019), some issues

AU  - Baret, Kea
AB  - [The post-pandemic economic reality seeks deep economic policies adjustment, including redesigning fiscal rules. This paper contributes to feeds the debate by investigating the side-effects of fiscal rules’ compliance on social welfare. It considers national Budget Balance Rules’ (BBR) compliance effects on social welfare proxies and the channel through which it operates between 2004 and 2015. Instead of fiscal rules strength or fiscal rules presence effectiveness, the study focuses on fiscal rules’ compliance to assess the impact of fiscal rules’ performance on social welfare, using a so-called “Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML)” approach (Chernozhukov et al. (2018)). The results show that governments seem to reallocate their spending to achieve both BBR’s compliance and economic objectives, with negative consequences on social expenditure. We also conclude to an increasing effect on social inequalities, suggesting that governments face a trade-off between fiscal rules’ compliance and social objectives. Thanks to the DML methodology, we also identify the key determinants of national BBR’s compliance, taking care of voter preferences by computing a new proxy variable through a Latent Factor Analysis. We conclude that voter preferences appear as a significant factor of BBR’s compliance, supporting that the Wyplosz (2012)’s bias may matter when assessing fiscal rules’ performance.]

In its hegemonic iteration, the digital offers the foundation for an ideological separability of previously entangled realities and bodies.

The article argues that a more holistic and nuanced understanding of cyber offence and defence can be achieved if some of the intellectual silos and disagreements that have characterised the debate so far can be deconstructed and overcome. The article is in three parts. The first section briefly outlines some of the definitional fog that has plagued the cyber security discipline, including over what constitutes cyber offense and defence. The paper then summarises four different subcultures of cyber conflict studies that understand and study cyber security in different ways: International Relations (IR), Political Psychology, International Law, and Computer Science. The concluding section discusses how the cyber conflict studies discipline can move forward, be made more rigorous, and less prone to pathology and dead ends, including through the formation of a cohesive but heterogenous epistemic community.]

As will be shown, it is in the very essence of creativity as a concept not to attempt to define it, but rather to approach a general understanding of it. In order to then be able to adequately locate the work within the scientific discourse, I present what knowledge of the given research object is already available to build on. Since the concept of creativity in IT operates in the context of inter- and intradisciplinary discourses, it appears to

The reception and definition of Twine as a platform recalls the many debates of definitions surrounding electronic literature. Works in Twine have been included in interactive fiction competitions, displayed at independent games festivals, and built as part of interactive story jams. However, despite Twine’s link to hypertext fiction, it has not been as visible in the electronic literature community. In an interview in <em>Guardian</em>, designer and

AB  - Perhaps the chapter that must perform the most work in <em>Cloud Atlas</em> is “The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing.” Certainly, one could argue that the final, distant-future section, “Sloosha’s Crossin’,” has chronological priority, looking back on the other chapters of the text from a historical vantage point. One might also assert that the “Letters from Zedelghem” are central to the text, for it is there that the synechdochal “<em>Cloud Atlas Sextet</em>” is composed.¹ Ewing begins and ends the novel, however, thus placing its language and themes under more intense literary-critical scrutiny.² The chapter must not only introduce this strange book

For Burgess and Green, one of the most interesting and difficult things about writing a book on YouTube was the fact that it was still evolving. Late in the last decade, YouTube had a chameleonic character: it was a “distribution platform that can make the products of commercial media widely popular” while at the same time being “a platform for user-created content where challenges to commercial popular culture might emerge”

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Scientists are increasingly called upon to integrate across ecological and social disciplines to tackle complex coupled human and natural system (CHANS) problems. Integration of these disciplines is challenging and many scientists do not have experience with large integrated research projects. However, much can be learned about the complicated process of integration from such efforts. We document some of these lessons from a National Science Foundation-funded CHANS project (Forests, People, Fire) and present considerations for developing and engaging in coupled human and natural system projects. Certainly we are not the first to undertake this endeavor, and many of our findings complement those of other research teams. We focus here on the process of coming together, learning to work as an integrated science team, and describe the challenges and opportunities of engaging stakeholders (agency personnel and citizen communities of interests) in our efforts. Throughout this project our intention was to foster dialogue among diverse interests and, thus, incorporate this knowledge into uncovering primary social and ecological drivers of change. A primary tool was an agent-based model, Envision, that used this information in landscape simulation, visualization models, and scenario development. Although integration can be an end in itself, the proof of value in the approach can be the degree to which it provides new insights or tools to CHANS, including closer interaction among multiple stakeholders, that could not have been reached without it.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Collapse of social-ecological systems (SESs) is a common process in human history. Depletion of natural resources, scarcity of human capital, or both, is/are common pathways toward collapse. We use the system dynamics approach to better understand specific problems of small-scale, long-lived SESs. We present a qualitative (or conceptual) model using the conceptualization process of the system dynamics approach to study the dynamics of an oasis in Mexico that has witnessed a dramatic transition to decline in recent decades. We used indepth interviews, participant observation, expert opinions, and official statistical data sets to define the boundaries, and structure in a causal loop diagram of our studied system. We described historical trends and showed the reference mode for the main system variables (observed data), and analyzed the expected system behavior according to the system structure. We identified the main drivers that changed the system structure, as well as structural changes, and the effects of these changes on the dynamics, resilience, and vulnerability of this SES. We found that the tendency of this SES toward collapse was triggered by exogenous factors (growth of modern agriculture in nearby valleys, and socio-political relocation), and was maintained by an endogenous structure. These structural changes weakened the resilience of this SES. One of these changes resulted in a long-term maladaptation of the SES, which increased its vulnerability to frequent system disturbances (hurricanes and droughts). The conceptual model developed provides an in-depth qualitative description of the system, with an important amount of qualitative and quantitative information, to establish the structural hypothesis of the observed behavior. Using this qualitative model, the next research steps are to develop a quantitative model to test the qualitative theories, and to explore future scenarios of system resilience for decision-making processes to improve local conditions and restore the well-functioning of the system.]

AB  - [Traditional monitoring and evaluation tools are often costly and are not well placed to assess complex, multi-dimensional dynamic livelihood attributes, such as resilience. While these approaches may be accurate in measurement, they often fail to empower respondents to take action. Drawbacks of other participatory resilience approaches include a requirement for a large amount of information, significant time required to administer surveys, and data analysis burdens (Schipper and Langston 2015, 19; COP 2016). They also need a baseline and an end line to assess change. They typically fail to capture how farmers actively address specific shocks and stresses or what lessons can be learned. Given these limitations, an opportunity exists to review alternative approaches and develop different tools. Our approach and tool, farmbetter, attempts to build on lessons learned from developing and implementing these tools. Rather than characterizing the user as lacking agency in a challenging environment, farmbetter helps users make conscious decisions to adapt and withstand specific shocks and stresses such as floods, drought, or conflict, which can require contradictory coping strategies. We aim to then further connect farmers whose properties have similar agro-ecological conditions and challenges to better facilitate knowledge-sharing between food producers, ultimately improving learning and resilience. This allows for the connection of big data with (traditional) knowledge and competences already being used by farmers to improve resilience. This is enabled by advances in technology (e.g. mobile phone availability), which offer new opportunities to more easily and cheaply collect data as well as giving access to marginalized groups’ views and knowledge (e.g. Raghavan et al. 2016).]

Bogost claimed that the ability of digital games to explain processes through interactions was a powerful persuasive characteristic, making them unique when it came to persuading players.

AU  - Carpenter, Stephen R.

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Adaptive capacity is the ability of a living system, such as a social–ecological system, to adjust responses to changing internal demands and external drivers. Although adaptive capacity is a frequent topic of study in the resilience literature, there are few formal models. This paper introduces such a model and uses it to explore adaptive capacity by contrast with the opposite condition, or traps. In a social–ecological rigidity trap, strong self-reinforcing controls prevent the flexibility needed for adaptation. In the model, too much control erodes adaptive capacity and thereby increases the risk of catastrophic breakdown. In a social–ecological poverty trap, loose connections prevent the mobilization of ideas and resources to solve problems. In the model, too little control impedes the focus needed for adaptation. Fluctuations of internal demand or external shocks generate pulses of adaptive capacity, which may gain traction and pull the system out of the poverty trap. The model suggests some general properties of traps in social–ecological systems. It is general and flexible, so it can be used as a building block in more specific and detailed models of adaptive capacity for a particular region.]

AB  - The pursuit of understanding big data first requires exploring the term<em>data</em>. It subsumes a variety of meanings and ideas. It is loaded with contextual meaning and depends on the beholder’s point of view; there are different perspectives of data. That aside, the term can be derived etymologically as follows:  “English<em>data</em>is derived from Latin, where it is the plural of<em>datum</em>, which is in turn the past participle of the verb<em>dare</em>, “to give,” generally translated into English as “something given.” Sanskrit<em>dadāmi</em>and ancient Greek δίδωμι are related forms.

TI  - Double coupling
AU  - Manuel-Navarrete, David
AB  - [ABSTRACT. Social-ecological organization is a multidimensional phenomenon that combines material and symbolic processes. However, the coupling between social and ecological subsystem is often conceptualized as purely material, thus reducing the symbolic dimension to its behavioral and actionable expressions. In this paper I conceptualize social-ecological systems as doubly coupled. On the one hand, material expressions of socio-cultural processes affect and are affected by ecological dynamics. On the other hand, coupled social-ecological material dynamics are concurrently coupled with subjective dynamics via coding, decoding, personal experience, and human agency. This second coupling operates across two organizationally heterogeneous dimensions: material and symbolic. Although resilience thinking builds on the recognition of organizational asymmetry between living and nonliving systems, it has overlooked the equivalent asymmetry between ecological and socio-cultural subsystems. Three guiding concepts are proposed to formalize double coupling. The first one, social-ecological asymmetry, expands on past seminal work on ecological self-organization to incorporate reflexivity and subjectivity in social-ecological modeling. Organizational asymmetry is based in the distinction between social rules, which are symbolically produced and changed through human agents’ reflexivity and purpose, and biophysical rules, which are determined by functional relations between ecological components. The second guiding concept, conscious power, brings to the fore human agents’ distinctive capacity to produce our own subjective identity and the consequences of this capacity for social-ecological organization. The third concept, congruence between subjective and objective dynamics, redefines sustainability as contingent on congruent relations between material and symbolic processes. Social-ecological theories and analyses based on these three guiding concepts would support the integration of current structuralist-functionalist methods, which sufficiently and appropriately characterize ecological organization, with ethnographic and narrative methods exploring human intentionality, reflexivity, and biographical development.]

TI  - Interactive tangible planning support systems and politics of public participation
AU  - PIPAN, Tomaž
AB  - [The complexity of the contemporary city stems from the numerous positions of its interpretation. The two most relevant to this paper are the augmentations of cities through digital technology and the ever-more-present participation requirement in the urban planning process. On one hand, digital technologies are promising efficient running of cities and better decision-making through a larger volume and better detail of information. On the other hand, the participatory agenda suggests a more levelled playing field for different stakeholders and a wider consensus. Both positions have limits—the first in the myriad of data produced that makes the digital city unreadable to the public and decision-makers without the help of specialized professionals, and the second in forming and keeping a consensus between stakeholders in the planning process. This paper explores how these limits can be addressed. Recently, interactive tangible planning support systems (PSSs) have been promoted to improve the established urban planning and participation methodologies. They promise to make digital spatial data more accessible in the decision-making process and to establish a better consensus amongst stakeholders. This paper will compare two examples of the interactive tangible PSSs in order to illuminate how the interactive environments increase the usability of professional spatial information on one hand and how they contribute toward consensus-making on the other.]

Discursively, big data has come to mean much more. More than just taxonomy of size, big data is notable “because of its relationality to other data” (boyd and Crawford, 2).

AB  - It is now commonly believed that climate change is leading to an increased likelihood of unpredicted and severe weather conditions. Think of the extreme precipitation events as experienced in Western Europe in the summer of 2021. A major consequence is an increased probability of floods, threatening human lives, disrupting economic activities and the environment. In climate change research, the concept of such risk is usually defined as the combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (Parry, 2007). This definition is currently universally accepted by policy makers and the public at large. Interestingly, some natural disaster historians argue that this perception of

AU  - Huchler, Norbert
AB  - [The article proposes an analytical perspective on artificial intelligence (AI) that can be fruitful in the sociology of work. The practical logic of new forms of AI (connectionist AI) is described as an interplay of social and technical processes of opening and closing possibilities of knowledge and action. In order to develop this argument, it is first shown in which sense AI can be understood as a contingency-generating technology in socio-technical contexts. The architecture based on neural networks is elaborated as a decisive feature of connectionist AI that not only opens up technical possibilities but can also shape social processes and structures by ‘selectivity’. However, this shaping does not take place solely on the part of the AI, but only becomes apparent in the interplay with specific restrictions that lie both in the social context of use and in the algorithmic architecture of the AI itself. For research in the sociology of work, this means that contingency theory approaches must be linked with approaches that emphasise the limits of (‘intelligent’) digitalisation. The yield of such a perspective is outlined in relation to the control of work with AI.]

In light of growing evidence that water companies were increasingly discharging untreated sewage – illegally, intentionally and repeatedly – into public waterways and protected coastal areas, the Duke of Wellington, a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords, brought a bill to Parliament. As ‘sewerage undertakers’, water companies would be legally obliged to ‘take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated

The English word ‘tax’ originates from the Latin verb <em>taxare</em>, which also has a double meaning: to “<em>reproach, charge</em>, or <em>tax</em> with a fault,” and also to “<em>rate, value, appraise, estimate, determine</em> the worth of a thing” (Lewis and Short [1879] 2009). To tax thus also means working out a thing’s comparative worth. The significance of the role of taxation in the appraisal of property or income is easily lost when we operate within a money-based administrative order, something that can be taken

When someone “cares” about a local place – which can range from deep worry to disinterested awareness (Dreyfus 1991, 238) – they do so on the basis of being thrown into their own local world. Stiegler’s (2012) related notion of “attention”, however, adds an important proviso to this kind of Heideggerian formulation about care. It suggests that a capacity to attend to any object (such as a locality) is always already exteriorized into various technical objects and infrastructures. A locality

TI  - Assessing Policy Issue Interdependencies in Environmental Governance
AU  - HEDLUND, JOHANNA
AU  - BODIN, ÖRJAN
AU  - NOHRSTEDT, DANIEL
AB  - [The ability to effectively resolve complex environmental problems hinges upon the capacity to address several different challenges in concert. These challenges, what we refer to as policy issues, often relate to one another – they interdepend. Policy issue interdependency has been extensively theorised in the literature, yet few methodological approaches and little empirical evidence exist to translate the concept of policy issue interdependency to the on-the-ground realities facing policy actors in specific cases and contexts. We build from previous studies to develop a methodological procedure that investigates policy issue interdependencies in ways that take into account what measures and possible solutions policy actors have at their disposal in specific cases for specific environmental problems. By applying our methodological procedure to a case of water governance in Sweden, four insights emerged. First, validation by stakeholders confirms that our procedure produces reliable results. Second, we find that many, but certainly not all, policy issues are interdependent. More specifically, different patterns of policy issue interdependencies are associated with the biophysical and the governance spheres, respectively. Third, our results suggest that policy issue interdependencies are most important to consider when the overall level of interdependency is moderate. Last, our study raises new questions about policy actors’ perception of policy issue interdependencies. In particular, a key question for future research would be if reinforcing (win-win) or counteracting (trade-off) interdependencies are easier to comprehend and act on for policy actors.]

AB  - [Aim:Abiotic, biotic and dispersal factors interact to shape species distributions. At broad geographic extents, abiotic factors are thought to exert the greatest influence on the distribution, while biotic and dispersal factors strongly influence the distribution regionally and locally. We test whether reproductive traits relating to biotic and dispersal factors explain differences between estimated potential and occupied geographic distributions for 21 species of Trillium. Location:Eastern North America. Methods:Fundamental niches and associated predicted suitable distributions were estimated using climate-calibrated ecological niche models. We defined occupied distributions as the intersection between known ranges and predicted suitable areas (PSAs). Proportional occupancy of the predicted suitable distribution (PO) was calculated by dividing the area of the occupied distribution by the PSA. We related reproductive traits (ovule number, seed set, number of seeds/plant, seed mass, adult biomass, flower type: sessile/pedicellate) to PO using beta regression models. AICc was used to assess model fit. Results:There was considerable variation in PO across species (1.1%–96%, mean = 51%). Eighty-five percent of species with PO < 60% were sessile; 88% of species with PO > 60% were pedicellate. The best-fit beta regression (pseudo R2 = .70) yielded significantly lower PO for sessile-flowered species; ovule number and seed mass were also significant predictors of PO. Main conclusions:Variation in PO among study species can be explained by flower type, ovule number and seed mass—biotic traits related to dispersal ability. We posit that variation in dispersal potential stemming from primary and long-distance dispersers is related to occupancy of the predicted suitable distribution in Trillium. We exemplify a scenario in which life history traits explain why some species are range-restricted when their close relatives are widespread. Our methodology constitutes a powerful comparative framework that can be applied to diverse biological systems to inform conservation of rare species.]

AB  - The use of formalist techniques in the humanities is rare these days, almost passé. Formalism has been largely absorbed and, indeed, almost eliminated by variants of structuralism, which have proven more appealing to those who would situate the study of everything—and most particularly the study of aesthetics—within the study of society.  A rigid formalism assumes that there are certain formal characteristics of objects—most particularly aesthetic objects—that determine their identity and their consequence, or their essence. Much of geometry and topology, for instance, are formalist fields of study. The “essence” of a square is determined by a

Dr. Leonard grew up in the Midwest and later moved to Ventura, California, with his family.  He discusses his undergraduate years at Caltech, where he was active in athletics and majored in mechanical engineering, graduating in 1959.  As a graduate student at Stanford (PhD 1963), he specialized in nuclear engineering, working with Joel Ferziger.  In 1966, after three years at the RAND Corporation working on propulsion systems and fusion power, he returned to Stanford to teach nuclear engineering.  He moved to NASA’s Ames Research Center in 1973, working on computational fluid dynamics.  In 1985, he joined Caltech’s GALCIT as a professor of aeronautics, after a year there as a visiting professor.  He became von Kármán Professor in 2000 and Professor emeritus in 2005.  

In this interview, in addition to discussing his research, particularly on turbulence and vortices, and offering recollections of his GALCIT colleagues and students, he recalls his work on the Freshman Admissions Committee, the Administrative Committee on Supercomputers, the Academic Policies Committee, the Caltech Alumni Association, and the Caltech Y.

AB  - For the past few years, cloud computing has taken wing, and many organizations, including libraries, are embracing this technology. It is transforming the shape of technology and allowing libraries to reduce spending on technology infrastructure and improve accessibility to information and resources. For many organizations, it can increase productivity with fewer staff and streamline processes. Libraries are choosing to migrate from their aging legacy library system and library-housed servers to a system that is maintained by a vendor in the cloud.  One of the cloud services that has developed over the past few years is the Ex Libris unified library

While formal ontologies present the best known practical solution to the integration and aggregation of data from heterogeneous data sources, the implementation of such systems has been hampered by two problems. Firstly, they have been hampered by a lack of easily available and supported technological solutions for implementation and, secondly by a limited pool of knowledge modelling skills.

What happens to the enactive relays technics establish between subjectivities and distinct material practices, so apparent at the level of digital writing technologies, at this geopolitical scale? This chapter examines technics in their capacity to establish dynamic infrastructures that help sediment or unsettle materially realized social formations. Global economic networks defining late capitalism, and their extraterritorial logics of circulation, production, and consumption, have made the space-making potential of digital technics unavoidable.

Yet increasingly, social scientists and policy makers alike seem to recognize that not only are these events <em>unforeseen</em>, but they also are <em>unforeseeable</em>, a point that chaos theory has demonstrated (Lorenz 1963; Saperstein 1997).

AB  - [Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems. Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts, transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures, and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts, traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena, enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.]

AB  - [Despite the growth of terrorism literature in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, there remain several methodological challenges to studying certain aspects of terrorism. This is perhaps most evident in attempts to uncover the attitudes, motivations, and intentions of individuals engaged in violent extremism and how they are sometimes expressed in problematic behavior. Such challenges invariably stem from the fact that terrorists and the organizations to which they belong represent clandestine populations engaged in illegal activity. Unsurprisingly, these qualities make it difficult for the researcher to identify and locate willing subjects of study—let alone a representative sample. In this research note, we suggest the systematic analysis of terrorist autobiographies offers a promising means of investigating difficult-to-study areas of terrorism-related phenomena. Investigation of autobiographical accounts not only offers additional data points for the study of individual psychological issues, but also provides valuable perspectives on the internal structures, processes, and dynamics of terrorist organizations more broadly. Moreover, given most autobiographies cover critical events and personal experiences across the life course, they provide a unique lens into how terrorists perceive their world and insight into their decision-making processes. We support our advocacy of this approach by highlighting its methodological strengths and shortcomings.]

Many of these fundamental mindsets about what constitutes humanity have become institutionally codified, continuing to mushroom in design practices and research development of devices, applications, and platforms despite the best efforts of many well-intentioned technologists, scholars, policy-makers, and industries. This essay argues why and how AI needs to be much more deeply integrated with the humanities and arts in order to contribute to human flourishing, particularly with regard to social justice. Informed by decolonial, disability, and gender critical frameworks, some AI artist-technologists of color challenge commercial imperatives of “personalization” and “frictionlessness,” representing race, ethnicity, and gender not as normative self-evident categories nor monetized data points, but as dynamic social processes always indexing political tensions and interests.]

But beyond this, it offered little more than the standard webpage info (biography, filmography, interviews, etc.—what the site would later link to as the “BORING stuff”).

AB  - Governments have a long history with information and communications technologies (ICT). From the computerisation of census tabulation, to military calculation and code breaking, it was government need that drove the initial development of mainframe computers and networking technologies around the world. In Australia, computerisation was supported by governments as part of the nation-building activities of the Commonwealth, with the objective of developing an industrial economy. For example, the production of the CSIR Mark 1 mainframe in the late 1940s (one of the first computers in the world) was an early initiative of what would become the CSIRO (Pass and Hornsby,

In 33 years time we would commute to a space station, in a Pan American passenger craft, and then on to the moon.

We cannot see the past; we can only see the present. And even when we look at something “from” the past, it still lives in the here-and-now.

Often, doing this can reveal a basis for calculations that are quite straightforward and that yield new insights into the most important aspects of the problem.  Used appropriately, computers can be invaluable tools, but they can also hide a multitude of errors. It is often best to do your calculations and plots by hand, particularly at first,

AB  - Is there a non-Anglo-American digital humanities (DH), and if so, what are its characteristics? A number of eminent European scholars, especially Dino Buzzetti, Tito Orlandi, and Manfred Thaller, identify differences in methodology as the key criterion distinguishing several DH approaches (i.e., continental versus Anglo-American DH). I agree that methodological issues are very important, but I do not see our two opinions (i.e., methodological versus cultural monopolization) in strong conflict. Of course, much depends on what we mean by “culture” and “methodology.” There has always been an attempt in Anglo-American DH/Humanities Computing to maintain a methodological dominion (and dominance) in terms

AB  - [This article argues that research on social-ecological systems could profit from the use of ontologies. Ontologies, i.e. formalized conceptualisations of a domain in a computer-readable format, allow making progress in different areas. In particular, a diagnostic approach would be facilitated, in turn addressing the complexity problem (analysing the complexity of social-ecological systems adequately), the panacea problem (the overreliance on simplistic policy prescriptions that do not account for this complexity) and the scatter problem (lack of integration of many research findings into a cohesive set of theoretical statements). Ontologies offer several advantages, e.g. they structure and formalize domains, unify knowledge, decrease terminological confusion, reduce incomparability, reduce redundancy of efforts and allow automated reasoning. We demonstrate the practical use of ontologies by converting the SES framework into an ontology. This leads to several suggestions on how to improve the framework.]

AB  - Abstract Since genetic criticism regards modern manuscripts as a research object in and of itself, it objects to an editorial practice that treats manuscript studies as a mere tool towards the making of a scholarly edition. Still, an exchange of ideas between genetic criticism and scholarly editing can be mutually beneficial and may work in two directions. This essay therefore starts from digital scholarly editing, more specifically from recent developments in computer-assisted collation of multiple draft versions, to see how it can contribute to the study of modern manuscripts. The argument is that the combination of textual scholarship and genetic criticism can be an effective instrument for literary critics, enabling them to study the material aspect of the writing process as an inherent part of what cognitive philosophy calls &#x201c;the extended mind&#x201d;; and that this extensiveness does not only apply to the writer's mind, but that an awareness of manuscripts as a crucial part of the &#x201c;stuff of fiction&#x201d; can also contribute to a better understanding of literary evocations of the fictional mind.

AB  - [Partial measurements of relative position are a relatively common event during the observation of visual binary stars. However, these observations are typically discarded when estimating the orbit of a visual pair. In this article we present a novel framework to characterize the orbits from a Bayesian standpoint, including partial observations of relative position as an input for the estimation of orbital parameters. Our aim is to formally incorporate the information contained in those partial measurements in a systematic way into the final inference. In the statistical literature, an imputation is defined as the replacement of a missing quantity with a plausible value. To compute posterior distributions of orbital parameters with partial observations, we propose a technique based on Markov chain Monte Carlo with multiple imputation. We present the methodology and test the algorithm with both synthetic and real observations, studying the effect of incorporating partial measurements in the parameter estimation. Our results suggest that the inclusion of partial measurements into the characterization of visual binaries may lead to a reduction in the uncertainty associated to each orbital element, in terms of a decrease in dispersion measures (such as the interquartile range) of the posterior distribution of relevant orbital parameters. The extent to which the uncertainty decreases after the incorporation of new data (either complete or partial) depends on how informative those newly incorporated measurements are. Quantifying the information contained in each measurement remains an open issue.]

AB  - [BACKGROUND Many of the reproductive decisions that humans make happen without much planning or forethought, arising instead through the use of simple choice rules or heuristics that involve relatively little information and processing. Nonetheless, these heuristic-guided decisions are typically beneficial, owing to humans’ ecological rationality – the evolved fit between our constrained decision mechanisms and the adaptive problems we face. OBJECTIVE This paper reviews research on the ecological rationality of human decision making in the domain of reproduction, showing how fertility-related decisions are commonly made using various simple heuristics matched to the structure of the environment in which they are applied, rather than being made with information-hungry mechanisms based on optimization or rational economic choice. METHODS First, heuristics for sequential mate search are covered; these heuristics determine when to stop the process of mate search by deciding that a good-enough mate who is also mutually interested has been found, using a process of aspiration-level setting and assessing. These models are tested via computer simulation and comparison to demographic age-at-first-marriage data. Next, a heuristic process of feature-based mate comparison and choice is discussed, in which mate choices are determined by a simple process of feature-matching with relaxing standards over time. Parental investment heuristics used to divide resources among offspring are summarized. Finally, methods for testing the use of such mate choice heuristics in a specific population over time are then described.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of research frameworks that emphasise the importance of understanding adaptive processes that happen at different levels. We contribute to this growing body of literature by exploring how cultural (mal) adaptive dynamics relate to multilevel social-ecological processes occurring at different scales, where the lower levels combine into new units with new organizations, functions, and emergent properties or collective behaviors. After a brief review of the concept of “cultural adaptation” from the perspective of cultural evolutionary theory, the core of the paper is constructed around the exploration of multilevel processes occurring at the temporal, spatial, social, and political scales. We do so by using insights from cultural evolutionary theory and by examining small-scale societies as case studies. In each section, we discuss the importance of the selected scale for understanding cultural adaptation and then present an example that illustrates how multilevel processes in the selected scale help explain observed patterns in the cultural adaptive process. The last section of the paper discusses the potential of modeling and computer simulation for studying multilevel processes in cultural adaptation. We conclude by highlighting how elements from cultural evolutionary theory might enrich the multilevel process discussion in resilience theory.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. This paper shows how, with the aid of computer models developed in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to quantify and map how policy decisions are likely to affect multiple ecosystem services in future. In this way, potential trade-offs and complementarities between different ecosystem services can be identified, so that policies can be designed to avoid the worst trade-offs, and where possible, enhance multiple services. The paper brings together evidence from across the Rural Economy and Land Use Programme’s Sustainable Uplands project for the first time, with previously unpublished model outputs relating to runoff, agricultural suitability, biomass, heather cover, age, and utility for Red Grouse (Lagopus scotica), grass cover, and accompanying scenario narratives and video. Two contrasting scenarios, based on policies to extensify or intensify land management up to 2030, were developed through a combination of interviews and discussions during site visits with stakeholders, literature review, conceptual modeling, and process-based computer models, using the Dark Peak of the Peak District National Park in the UK as a case study. Where extensification leads to a significant reduction in managed burning and grazing or land abandonment, changes in vegetation type and structure could compromise a range of species that are important for conservation, while compromising provisioning services, amenity value, and increasing wildfire risk. However, where extensification leads to the restoration of peatlands damaged by former intensive management, there would be an increase in carbon sequestration and storage, with a number of cobenefits, which could counter the loss of habitats and species elsewhere in the landscape. In the second scenario, land use and management was significantly intensified to boost UK self-sufficiency in food. This would benefit certain provisioning services but would have negative consequences for carbon storage and water quality and would lead to a reduction in the abundance of certain species of conservation concern. The paper emphasizes the need for spatially explicit models that can track how ecosystem services might change over time, in response to policy or environmental drivers, and in response to the changing demands and preferences of society, which are far harder to anticipate. By developing such models in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to depict scenarios of real concern to those who need to use the research findings. By engaging these collaborators with the research findings through film, it was possible to discuss adaptive options to minimize trade-offs and enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services under the very different future conditions depicted by each scenario. By preparing for as wide a range of futures as possible in this way, it may be possible for decision makers to act rapidly and effectively to protect and enhance the provision of ecosystem services in the face of unpredictable future change.]

Nevertheless, there is a tendency to emphasize known computable aspects of a problem while neglecting aspects that are unknown and failing to ask questions about them. The tendency to ignore the noncomputable can be countered by considering a wide range of perspectives, encouraging transparency with regard to conflicting viewpoints, stimulating a diversity of models, and managing for the emergence of new syntheses that reorganize fragmentary knowledge.]

AB  - [Abstract This article offers an alternative framework for understanding the sources of national security and power online. Wide-scale deployment of cyberweaponry regularly occurs beyond the scope of direct attacks on the infrastructure of national security and has a real effect on the power potential of states in the international system. Though the threat of cyberattack is a potent one, the greater impact on state power stems from the long-term disruption and distortion of the national innovation economy. The integration of civil and industrial functions with network systems allows for unprecedented levels of access to those second-order processes that underwrite national innovative potential and, ultimately, national power. A disruption to this underlying national apparatus via persistent, intrusive computer network exploitations (CNE) could diminish the innovative growth potential of sovereign actors in international affairs along several lines and essentially produce a power potential deficit that would not otherwise have existed.]

AU  - d’Albis, Hippolyte
AU  - Collard, Fabrice
AB  - [BACKGROUND Measures of population aging are important because they shape our perception of demographic trends. Indicators of aging based on fixed ages contributed to a dramatic portrayal of demographic evolutions, some of which were associated with the myth of decline. OBJECTIVE We propose a new measure of population aging, based on the relative age of each individual in the population. Our approach builds on previous work by Aghevli and Mehran (1981) and relies on optimal grouping techniques that are used to determine the various age groups within a population. The cutoff ages for these groups, such as the age from which an individual is considered to be an older person, are then endogenous variables that depend on the entire population age distribution at any given moment. METHODS We show how to apply optimal grouping techniques to age distributions and how to calculate various indicators of aging, which are invariant with respect to proportional rescaling of distributions. We compute these indicators for the US, and a sample of 13 other industrialized countries. RESULTS We find that, contrary to common arguments for an aging population, the share of elderly individuals within the total population has not increased much, and has remained stable in these countries. These results complement and reinforce the earlier findings of Sanderson and Scherbov (2005, 2007) who also reassessed the aging phenomenon.]

AB  - ABSTRACT.Exponential, de Vaucouleurs, and S&#xe9;rsic profiles are simple and successful models for fitting two-dimensional images of galaxies. One numerical issue encountered in this kind of fitting is the pixel rendering and convolution (or correlation) of the models with the telescope point-spread function (PSF); these operations are slow, and easy to get slightly wrong at small radii. Here we exploit the realization that these models can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a mixture (linear superposition) of two-dimensional Gaussians (MoGs). MoGs are fast to render and fast to affine-transform. Most importantly, if you have a MoG model for the pixel-convolved PSF, the PSF-convolved, affine-transformed galaxy models are themselves MoGs and therefore very fast to compute, integrate, and render precisely. We present worked examples that can be directly used in image fitting; we are using them ourselves. The MoG profiles we provide can be swapped in to replace the standard models in any image-fitting code; they sped up model fitting in our projects by an order of magnitude; they ought to make any code faster at essentially no cost in precision.

AB  - En este art&#xed;culo se argumenta que la corriente dominante en econom&#xed;a no es un bloque monol&#xed;tico sino que, m&#xe1;s bien, se compone de un n&#xfa;cleo ortodoxo en el que prevalece el pensamiento neocl&#xe1;sico y un conjunto de enfoques de vanguardia que comparten con la ortodoxia su inter&#xe9;s por la modelaci&#xf3;n formal (matem&#xe1;tica, computacional o estad&#xed;stica) y por el an&#xe1;lisis del comportamiento micro para describir fen&#xf3;menos agregados. Al revisar las fichas bibliogr&#xe1;ficas de la base de datos de RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) se encuentra, por un lado, que las investigaciones que se realizaron a nivel mundial con enfoques de vanguardia tuvieron un gran crecimiento en el periodo 2000-2012 y, por otro, que las investigaciones econ&#xf3;micas de &#xed;ndole vanguardista en M&#xe9;xico son relativamente escasas. Esta falta de pluralidad tambi&#xe9;n se refleja en los programas de licenciatura y posgrado de las universidades mexicanas, en donde la estructura curricular se limita la mayor&#xed;a de las veces a planteamientos ortodoxos y en unos cuantos casos a tratamientos heterodoxos (es decir, que se ubican fuera de la corriente dominante). In this essay it is argued that mainstream economics is not a monolithic block but instead it is composed by an orthodox nucleus, where neoclassical thinking prevails, and a set of approaches on the edge that share with the orthodoxy their interest for formal modeling (mathematical, computational or statistical), and for analyzing micro behavior to describe aggregate phenomena. By reviewing bibliographic references in the RePEc data base, it is found that worldwide research using approaches on the edge of mainstream economics grew substantially in the period 2000-2012, while this type of research is relatively rare in Mexico. This lack of plurality is also reflected in the country's study programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, where the curricular structure is limited mainly to an orthodox perspective and, in few cases, to an heterodox focus (i. e., outside mainstream).

AB  - ABSTRACT.We present EXOFAST, a fast, robust suite of routines written in IDL that is designed to fit exoplanetary transits and radial velocity variations simultaneously or separately and characterize the parameter uncertainties and covariances with a differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We describe how our code incorporates both data sets to derive simultaneously stellar parameters along with the transit and RV parameters, resulting in more self-consistent results on an example fit of the discovery data of HAT-P-3b that is well-mixed in under 5&#xa0;minutes on a standard desktop computer. We describe in detail how our code works and outline ways in which the code can be extended to include additional effects or generalized for the characterization of other data sets&#x2014;including non-planetary data sets. We discuss the pros and cons of several common ways to parameterize eccentricity, highlight a subtle mistake in the implementation of MCMC that could bias the inferred eccentricity of intrinsically circular orbits to significantly non-zero results, discuss a problem with IDL&#x2019;s built-in random number generator in its application to large MCMC fits, and derive a method to analytically fit the linear and quadratic limb darkening coefficients of a planetary transit. Finally, we explain how we achieved improved accuracy and over a factor of 100 improvement in the execution time of the transit model calculation. Our entire source code, along with an easy-to-use online interface for several basic features of our transit and radial velocity fitting, are available online at http://astroutils.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/exofast.

AB  - [New tools and methodologies are required in systemic planning and management of mountain protected areas. Among others we propose here a decision support toolbox (DST) conceived as an integrated collection of both soft and hard system methodologies, consisting of participatory and computer-based modules to provide a set of integrated, self-contained tools and approaches to support decision-making processes in the management of mountain protected areas. The Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ) in Nepal was taken as a pilot case. A number of participatory exercises such as participatory 3-dimensional modeling, scenario planning, and qualitative modeling were carried out to understand social-ecological processes and generate a systemic view over space and time. The qualitative models were then converted into computer-based system dynamics models. The design and development of DST software were carried out with an incremental and modular approach. This process involved stakeholder analysis and decision-making processes through a series of consultations. The software was developed with the main modules including scenario analysis, spatial analysis, and knowledge base. The scenario analysis module runs system dynamics models built in Simile software and provides functions to link them with spatial data for model inputs and outputs. The spatial analysis module provides the basic geographic information system functions to explore, edit, analyze, and visualize spatial information. The knowledge base module was developed as a metadata management system for different categories of information such as spatial data, bibliography, research data, and models. The development of DST software, especially system dynamics modeling and its linkage with spatial components, provided an important methodological approach for spatial and temporal integration. Furthermore, training and interactions with park managers and concerned stakeholders showed that DST is a useful platform for integrating data and information and better understanding ecosystem behavior as a basis for management decisions.]

AB  - How life emerged out of matter is, of course, a great mystery. Even creationists do not argue that life emerges out of nothing (they only claim such an event for the creation of being itself). Life somehow arose on the basis of what already was. Despite not having a detailed model for how this did in fact occur, there is a clear consensus that life emerged spontaneously from chemical matter. The leading proponent and articulator of this view is, of course, Stuart Kauffman: “Life is an expected, collectively self-organized property of catalytic polymers.”⁶⁷ Kauffman here uses the concept of ‘self-organization;’

It can be manipulated on a set of black and white tiles by hand without an ordinary computing machine for instance. I’ll return to this later.

TI  - Internal Instability and Technology: Do Text Messages and Social Media Increase Levels of Internal Conflict?
AU  - Henken, Lucas
AB  - Political instability and internal conflict impact the lives of thousands every single day. Understanding when and why these conflicts occur has been the focus of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and scholars for years. Predicting internal conflict was originally qualitative in nature, based on the advice and predictions of regional and country experts. More recently, as computational technology has become more widely used and effective, the efforts at predicting internal conflict have become more quantitative. This paper builds off the work of prior scholars to explore the impact of technology on internal instability. A logit model is used to test the effect of particular independent variables – specifically cell phone and internet users – on internal instability during the Arab Spring. The results show that political factors and technology are significant in explaining internal instability during the Arab Spring, while economic factors had little statistical significance or impact on the predictive probability of the model. Access to, and the use of technology will only continue to grow. As it does, it is vital that governments, NGOs, and scholars acknowledge its growing role in driving social and political movements and its impact on internal instability.

Far better to be on the prowl for cybertrouble and—with a few keystrokes or by activating secret codes long ago secreted in a prospective foe’s computer system—thwart any attack.

AU  - Buizer, Marleen

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Any present day approach of the world’s most pressing environmental problems involves both scale and governance issues. After all, current local events might have long-term global consequences (the scale issue) and solving complex environmental problems requires policy makers to think and govern beyond generally used time-space scales (the governance issue). To an increasing extent, the various scientists in these fields have used concepts like social-ecological systems, hierarchies, scales and levels to understand and explain the “complex cross-scale dynamics” of issues like climate change. A large part of this work manifests a realist paradigm: the scales and levels, either in ecological processes or in governance systems, are considered as “real”. However, various scholars question this position and claim that scales and levels are continuously (re)constructed in the interfaces of science, society, politics and nature. Some of these critics even prefer to adopt a non-scalar approach, doing away with notions such as hierarchy, scale and level. Here we take another route, however. We try to overcome the realist-constructionist dualism by advocating a dialogue between them on the basis of exchanging and reflecting on different knowledge claims in transdisciplinary arenas. We describe two important developments, one in the ecological scaling literature and the other in the governance literature, which we consider to provide a basis for such a dialogue. We will argue that scale issues, governance practices as well as their mutual interdependencies should be considered as human constructs, although dialectically related to nature’s materiality, and therefore as contested processes, requiring intensive and continuous dialogue and cooperation among natural scientists, social scientists, policy makers and citizens alike. They also require critical reflection on scientists’ roles and on academic practices in general. Acknowledging knowledge claims provides a common ground and point of departure for such cooperation, something we think is not yet sufficiently happening, but which is essential in addressing today’s environmental problems.]

As I proposed there, it seems to me that the figure of human dignity and the effort to turn that figure into a practice can usefully be thought about as a restylization and reconfiguration of the principal elements of pastoral power

Randomness here really only means not predictable by us, as we have to let things unfold (<em>NKS</em> 750-52).

It has, at least rhetorically, heralded a shift from a focus on the way entities are accessed and known to an attempt to understand how they are constituted in themselves, from the idealism of the constituting mind (or equivalents) to a realism that seeks reality as it is in-itself.

AB  - We know that these are concepts taken for granted; but we must continuously remind ourselves that architectural survey is a ‘critical form’ of knowledge, a way in which we organize and put together a set of sizes, of analysis and of observations that make up a ‘discovery’. We know because we meet something again; discovery is a form of iterative deepening; we observe, we reveal, what we know becomes clear, we recognize, we re-reveal what we recognize, and we observe again. There are no alternatives to the operating practices that bind man to historicalarchitectonic goods, and from this ‘union’ knowledge

AB  - The archaeological record as it is appears in the present should be understood as a palimpsest: it is the material result of multiple depositional processes that have been acting over time. In order to reconstruct the most likely original deposition, we should go backwards to the activities carried out at the site during its occupation, and analysing the potential effects of different deformation processes (post-depositional disturbances and taphonomic effects) occurred after the site’s abandonment. Biasing effects of events having occurred over time may have strongly altered the surface of our deposit, affecting the preservation status of finds as well as

The physical space is used for a variety of functions, including the storage and retrieval of print materials and other physical objects; computer terminals for walk-in access to licensed resources; staff workspace; public desks or interaction spaces; individual

The widespread adoption of spreadsheets and relational databases in Archaeology is due to a number of factors including the nature and scale of archaeological data (broadly compatible with a spreadsheet or table view) and the long history (since the 1960s) of computerisation of field and analysis data within the discipline.  Much of the early computerisation of data in archaeology, through the 1960s and 1970s, took the form of flat-file tables formatted for analysis by statistics packages such as SPSS (e.g. several examples in

Many academic libraries have carved out physical space where patrons can experiment with designing art installations or objects and use equipment such as 3D printers to prototype their ideas; these workshop spaces and creative laboratories are, in turn, inspired by the makerspaces where engineers and computer scientists come together to take things apart and put them back together in innovative ways. Working in such inventive spaces, whether in open laboratories or prototyping studios, people are finding innovation in using old circuits or tools in

For a moment after death, a player stares into her computer screen at her own corpse, her removed first-person perspective hovering over it, still attached to but disembodied from the avatar that allows her to experience the virtual space of the game. In this moment, the player knows she is dependent on that object, the body/corpse, that she has been forcibly separated from. The corpse’s existence is no longer fully dependent on the player.

AB  - In recent years, several international events have provided the opportunity to reflect upon the history of archaeological computing as an autonomous discipline and to reassess its theoretical basis by reconsidering the earliest applications. A key clue of this historiographical approach can be found in the exponential growth of technology applied to archaeological documentation procedures, which at present strongly characterise this discipline, overshadowing in many cases past theoretical and methodological advances.  We can recall various attempts made in this direction. First, during the international Symposium held in Rome at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 2008 that specifically addressed ‘The Birth

Wooden-wheeled wheelchairs. In the last century, the definition of a cyborg has of course deepened and broadened.

Librarians sometimes receive requests from users for access to specialized resources for which setting up campus wide access is challenging for any number of reasons. For example, a resource may require:  specialized access arrangements (password sharing or distribution);  local hosting;  data that exceeds the amount available to end-users who are using the vendor platform;  challenging license terms and;  software installation on one or more computers.

This paper investigates analytical modelling and simulation studies on the HCH to test the way innovative features were incorporated to guarantee its structural integrity, and assess the significance of such architectural innovations to proto-urban setting. More specifically, reviewing older research in the southern Greek mainland, the corridor feature has been associated with various

Our goal was to generate a solution that is built on top of these legacy data, but can also fit new requirements for the Linked Open Data world. This resulted in our database solution called Antike Fundmünzen in Europa (AFE-WEB), where we record finds of ancient coins. In addition, we

AB  - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has drafted the following definition of literacy:  Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning to enable an individual to achieve his or her goals, to develop his or her knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in the wider society.¹  The first part of this definition links literacy to our cognition as an ability. Abilities develop skills and habits. Much of everyday life as a performer will focus on skills and

AB  - An inbuilt desire to stray from the path, across the grass in a city park, is one example of how the learned or ‘schooled’ body misbehaves. I’m interested in the tension between our body’s social contract and hard-wired collective behaviour. I’m also interested in what happens when the mind no longer requires a body to communicate. When we sit at a desk computer or peer into a smartphone, our minds log in and our sense of embodied self rapidly decreases. The networked mind locks into a network stream and sends itself to locations far from the host body’s reach. How

The participants might get a sense of community and a feeling of belonging, and apparently the computer mediation of the interaction is no hindrance for developing significant relationships. Along the same lines, most of the studies have proven the participants to be competent individuals gathered around a common denominator—the interest in soap operas (Baym 1995, 1997, 2000), play-like hanging around (Kendall 2002), pre-movie

AB  - We construct a stochastic overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which households are subject to aggregate shocks that affect both wages and asset prices. We use a calibrated version of the model to quantify how the welfare costs of big recessions are distributed across different household age groups. The model predicts that younger cohorts fare better than older cohorts when the equilibrium decline in asset prices is large relative to the decline in wages. Asset price declines hurt the old, who rely on asset sales to finance consumption, but benefit the young, who purchase assets at depressed prices. In our preferred calibration, asset prices decline 2.4 times as much as wages, consistent with the experience of the US economy in the Great Recession. A model recession is close to welfare neutral for households in the 20–29 age group, but translates into a large welfare loss of more than 8% of lifetime consumption for households aged 70 and over.

AU  - Perri, Fabrizio

AU  - Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Research Department
AB  - In simple one-good international macro models, the presence of non-diversifiable labor income risk means that country portfolios should be heavily biased toward foreign assets. The fact that the opposite pattern of diversification is observed empirically constitutes the international diversification puzzle. We embed a portfolio choice decision in a frictionless two-country, two-good version of the stochastic growth model. In this environment, which is a workhorse for international business cycle research, we derive a closed-form expression for equilibrium country portfolios. These are biased towards domestic assets, as in the data. Home bias arises because endogenous international relative price fluctuations make domestic stocks a good hedge against non-diversifiable labor income risk. We then use our theory to link openness to trade to the level of diversification, and find that it offers a quantitatively compelling account for the patterns of international diversification observed across developed economies in recent years.
