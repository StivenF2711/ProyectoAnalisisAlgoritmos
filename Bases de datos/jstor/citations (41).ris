TI  - Virtual Reality:
AU  - Ng, Jenna
AB  - The lines above are lyrics from a love song. Written by Stephen Sondheim for the acclaimed 1970 Broadway comedy musical, <em>Company</em>, “Multitudes of Amys” was to mark the moment the protagonist, a bachelor named Robert who had been unable to commit to a relationship, realizes he is in love with Amy.² What is interesting for our purposes is how Robert sings of his love not as an emotion but an <em>omnipresence</em> – his being in love is to be surrounded by “<em>multitudes</em>,” or to see and hear his object of affection everywhere he looks. The grand emotion of love replaces Robert’s

TI  - Constructivism and its risks in artificial intelligence
AU  - Lea, Gary R
AB  - [The research and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies involve choices that extend well beyond the search for narrow engineering solutions to problems. The label ‘constructivism’ is used to capture this larger realm of social choice. Drawing on the history of AI, a distinction is made between limited artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Both forms, the paper argues, carry risks. Following this history, the paper outlines how different approaches to rationality have led to different ‘tribes’ of AI. No universal model of rationality is available to AI engineers. Choice is everywhere. The paper then moves to an exploration of the links between AI and chess. It argues that chess, far from being an objective measure of rationality and intelligence, reveals the subjective biases and risks involved in the pursuit of AI. The paper moves on to provides examples of various unstable and potentially dangerous race heats taking place in AI, including those among various AI research groups (public and private), among corporations and among states. The final section draws together the various risks of AI.]

TI  - Household transitions between ages 5 and 15 and educational outcomes
AU  - Reynolds, Sarah A.
AB  - [BACKGROUND Latin America has high rates of single motherhood and intergenerational coresidence, resulting in children experiencing changes in household composition – particularly with respect to fathers and grandparents. In other contexts, such changes have been shown to influence educational outcomes. OBJECTIVE To test if the presence of grandparents and fathers in the household are differentially associated with educational outcomes during schooling years in Peru. METHODS Young Lives longitudinal data consist of around 2,000 children who were followed from age 1 to age 15 between 2002 and 2017. Using value-added and child fixed effects models, I examine if the number of changes in household structure involving fathers and grandparents, the type of change (exit or entrance), and the identity of the household members are associated with cognitive outcomes. Persistence was tested as well as heterogeneous associations by child’s age at transition and disadvantage. RESULTS More than half the children experienced a change in household composition between ages 5 and 15. Father separation was associated with worse cognitive scores and lower likelihood of being on-grade. This was strongest if separation occurred when children were older. Grandparent presence in the household was not as strongly correlated with child outcomes, but results suggest that children have better cognitive performance after grandparent separation from the household. Associations between household composition and child outcomes were stronger if children were disadvantaged. CONTRIBUTION This research provides evidence that fathers and grandparents are both important contributors to child educational outcomes in a context where three-generational households are common.]

AB  - In this paper we construct a stochastic overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which households are subject to aggregate shocks that affect both wages and asset prices. We use a calibrated version of the model to quantify how the welfare costs of severe recessions are distributed across different household age groups. The model predicts that younger cohorts fare better than older cohorts when the equilibrium decline in asset prices is large relative to the decline in wages, as observed in the data. Asset price declines hurt the old, who rely on asset sales to finance consumption, but benefit the young, who purchase assets at depressed prices. In our preferred calibration, asset prices decline more than twice as much as wages, consistent with the experience of the US economy in the Great Recession. A model recession is approximately welfare-neutral for households in the 20–29 age group, but translates into a large welfare loss of around 10% of lifetime consumption for households aged 70 and over.

Through methods of Cultural Analytics, Cinemetrics (2005) and ACTION (2014), which can be described as cinemetric or stylometric, scholars measure, quantify and visualize stylistic patterns in, for instance, editing, light or sound. These are used to investigate historical developments in film aesthetics and narration and to produce statistical profiles of films, directors or national cinemas.  Characterized by scientific rigour, deduction and hypothesis-testing, Cinemetrics’ quantitative framework has been perceived as introducing a new empiricism or positivism in film historical research

AU  - Steenbergen, Dirk J.
AU  - Warren, Carol
AB  - [We examine collaborative arrangements for resource management between communities and external agencies, with a particular interest in how community-based interventions are integrated into local contexts. This timely inquiry comes in a period when participatory resource management approaches are increasingly being applied to overcome the perpetual cycles of poverty in which poor resource-dependent people find themselves, i.e., social-ecological traps. Much of the literature on social-ecological traps has focused on identifying conditions, factors, and responses that are important in, for example, alleviating systemic poverty or developing sustainable resource management systems. However, insufficient focus has been placed on understanding the practical processes by which strategies are implemented, and how these can reflexively affect the system itself. Drawing from a case study of a locally managed marine area in Indonesia, we examine the interactions between a nongovernment organization and a target community during the implementation of a fisheries management plan. Applying insights from rural development studies, we show how external interventions, designed to pull people out of social-ecological traps, are operationalized into forms that make them locally familiar and appropriate through actions of community brokers and processes of “institutional bricolage.” We argue that as a consequence of implementing processes, such interventions should be expected to diverge from their initial science-based justification.]

AU  - Dombrowski, Peter
AU  - Ross, Andrew L.
AB  - [Revolutions in Military Affairs (RMA) and transformations are uncommon phenomena. They entail fundamental and disruptive discontinuities. To date, the US transformation enterprise has fallen short of the RMA hype. It entails incremental advances with little evidence of generation-skipping technologies and has so far had only modest impact on US procurement programs. Hence US military transformation is unlikely to pose insurmountable challenges for the US defence industrial sector. In particular, the systems integration innovation required to realise network centric warfare is primarily sustaining rather than disruptive, requiring suppliers to build on existing, not develop new, capabilities. Close supplier-customer relationships in this sector, the emphasis on sustaining innovation, and the scale of the systems integration work required constitute formidable barriers to entry for new systems integrators, including commercial information technology (IT) firms. These barriers are being reinforced as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon invest heavily in organic IT capabilities.]

AB  - [Digitalization presents many opportunities but also challenges for society. This also entails new tasks for the field of education. This article discusses how geography teaching can contribute to these opportunities and challenges from a subject- and education-specific perspective. To this end, we analyse aspects of subject-specific digitalization and terms associated with digitalization in curricular and framework requirements (n = 57 documents) for different types of schools in every German federal state. We use this to deduce the extent to which the state of subject-specific digitalization is in line with the society’s requirements. In addition, we derive insights into why digitalization is critical to geography education. Mit der Digitalisierung sind viele Möglichkeiten, aber auch Herausforderungen für die Gesellschaft verbunden, die auch die Bildung vor neue Aufgaben stellt. Welchen Beitrag der Geographieunterricht dazu leisten kann, soll in diesem Beitrag aus einer fachdidaktischen Perspektive diskutieren werden. Dafür werden Aspekte einer fachspezifischen Digitalisierung und mit Digitalisierung verbundene Begriffe in curricularen Vorgaben (n = 57 Dokumente) der verschie­denen Schulformen der Bundesländer Deutschlands inhaltsanalytisch analysiert. Aus der Analyse soll abgeleitet werden, inwiefern der Stand der fachspezifischen Digitalisierung mit den Anforderungen der Gesellschaft einhergeht. Zudem sollen Einsichten zum Beitrag und zum Bedarf von Digitalisierung im Geographieunterricht abgeleitet werden.]

TI  - Evidence to Explain Violent Extremist Communication
AU  - De Bruyn, Phillip Conrad
AB  - [Advances in computational approaches to detect violent extremists have made it possible to reliably identify these individuals through their communication, with accuracy ranging from 87 to 92% (95% CI), depending on the model used. Of interest is whether various facets of their communication can be explained through existing empirical research, whose findings may point to opportunities for intervention. To explore the possibility of explanatory evidence, this study conducted a systematic review of studies that presented original data and findings at the individual level of extremism. Samples of the qualifying studies (n = 272) over the last 20 years were disaggregated by individual type (e.g., lone-actor terrorist, online extremist), which included affiliations with a range of extremist groups, organizations, and ideological classifications. Using a series of linguistic dimensions observed in extremist communication as an organizing framework, the findings of these studies were grouped together as possible factors behind the various fine-grained manifestations of extremist ideology observed by high-performing models capable of extremist detection (n = 28). The work serves practitioners interested in an organizing framework for extremist communication studied as big data or those who merely seek a state-of-the-art systematic review of Islamic-based extremism. Comparatively, this study is the largest of such reviews to date, as an exploratory effort to offer possible explanations for ideological communication by extremists, and draws on samples from multiple populations of empirical studies on fundamentalism, Islamism, jihadism, and radicalization into terrorism.]

In one sense, queer studies and the digital humanities (DH) share a common ethos: a commitment to exploring new ways of thinking and to challenging accepted paradigms of meaning-making. At the same time, as scholars like J. S. Bianco have argued, many of the data-driven initiatives that have earned DH its most visible accolades eschew rather than engage topics of difference and identity.¹ Though a number of queer studies and digital humanities scholars have already begun bringing queer perspectives to DH, much of this work remains marginal within the larger DH field.

Community archaeology is an active collaboration between archaeologists and local communities not only on the topic of heritage

AB  - [The underpinnings of today’s mental health crisis include both social structural inequities and neurobiological vulnerabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded and escalated a long-standing problem, rendering the mental health crisis and its dangerous consequences visible and exigent. We now possess a clearer and more nuanced understanding of the broken mental health care system and its serious inadequacies, as well as its potential for effective caregiving. The professional forms of knowledge and practice are paralleled by an even more substantial system of care involving families, networks, communities, and, of course, those living with mental health conditions themselves. Even when delivered by community care workers, psychotherapy can be as effective as somatic treatments for some mental health conditions. Harm reduction and other public health approaches offer means of preventing or mitigating the disastrous human toll of the substance use disorder epidemic. Social technology offers new opportunities for enhancing mental health and well-being. With these informal systems alongside standardized health care systems, the future could realize a mental health care system with much greater potential to avert the worst harms and offer effective care to many more.]

AU  - Lischer-Katz, Zack
AB  - [The increasing ubiquity of algorithmically mediated digital texts continues to generate debate about the instability and indeterminacy of texts. The American composer John Cage is well known for disrupting traditional Western aesthetics by incorporating chance operations, algorithms, and indeterminacy into his musical compositions and literary texts. This article analyzes materials found in the pre-print archive of Cage’s printed book, M (published in 1973 by Wesleyan University Press), in order to understand how Cage brought his aesthetic of indeterminacy into print. Through analysis of archival materials, it is argued that Cage exercised control over the performance and reading of his texts, even as he ceded authorial control to the aleatory processes of the I Ching—the ancient Chinese book of divination—and to the arbitrary choices of the typesetter/printer. This article offers new understanding about algorithms and indeterminacy in the performance of bibliographic codes.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Assessments of ecosystem services (ES), that aim at informing decisions on land management, are increasing in number around the globe. Despite selected success stories, evidence for ES information being used in decision making is weak, partly because ES assessments are found to fall short in targeting information needs by decision makers. To improve their applicability in practice, we compared existing concepts of ES assessments with focus on informing land use decisions and identified opportunities for enhancing the relevance of ES assessments for decision making. In a process of codesign, building on experience of four projects in Brazil, China, Madagascar, and Vietnam, we developed a step-wise approach for better targeting ES assessments toward information needs in land use decisions. Our problem-oriented approach aims at (1) structuring ES information according to land use problems identified by stakeholders, (2) targeting context-specific ES information needs by decision makers, and (3) assessing relevant management options. We demonstrate how our approach contributes to making ES assessments more policy relevant and enhances the application of ES assessments as a tool for decision support.]

If the research of the first decade of the new millennium can be described as utopian, the following decade has arguably traced a darker portrait of new and social media as dystopian, focusing on misinformation, massive surveillance, prejudices and exploitation.

I briefly summarize the state of the art and its likely evolution over the next decade. Substantial breakthroughs leading to general-purpose AI are much harder to predict, but they will have an enormous impact on society. At the same time, the standard model will become progressively untenable in real-world applications because of the difficulty of specifying objectives completely and correctly. I propose a new model for AI development in which the machine’s uncertainty about the true objective leads to qualitatively new modes of behavior that are more robust, controllable, and deferential.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. The complexity of social-ecological systems is well recognized (Berkes et al. 2003, Norberg and Cumming 2008). However, in the study of such systems, it is often the uncertainty that results from nonlinear interactions that forms the focus of discussion. Here, the normative implications of complexity for our knowledge of such systems are emphasised, by drawing largely on the work of Cilliers (1998, 2005a), who introduced the term “critical complexity.” This perspective on complexity is distinct in bringing the value-based choices that frame our knowledge generation strategies to the fore. It is from this view that we investigate the implications of complexity for social-ecological systems research. Based on these implications, we propose a set of five key questions to guide the incorporation of insights from critical complexity into such research. We end with a brief application of the questions proposed to the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) project in South Africa, to illustrate their potential use in the context of resource management.]

AB  - During the years of 1948 to 1991 the South African government instituted oppressive policies, aimed at keeping control over a specific segment of their population. If, in that time, the Apartheid-instituting government had access to AI algorithms, perhaps history would have been different. That is the premise of our design fiction. In it, we create a narrative in which a major point in history is negatively impacted by single-minded AI technology, and explain how collective AI might help avoid such situations. By speculating through design fiction, we are able explore ethical and social issues of everyday life, asking what-if questions

AB  - I define Cultural Analytics as the analysis of massive cultural data sets and flows using computational and visualization techniques. I developed this concept in 2005, and in 2007, the Software Studies Initiative¹ research lab was established to start working on Cultural Analytics projects.  Our work is driven by a number of theoretical and practical questions: What does it mean to represent ‘culture’ by ‘data’? What are the unique possibilities offered by the computational analysis of large cultural data in contrast to qualitative methods used in humanities and social sciences? How can quantitative techniques be used to study the key cultural

AB  - As computational analysis accelerates in visualising performance objectives, the integration of generative design and metaheuristic search tools, which are designed for systematic problem-solving, is shifting to the early stages of the design process (Harding and Shepherd, 2014). The strength of these tools in generating and evaluating design solutions offers a new perspective on the conceptualisation phase, where it is approached as a problem-solving process.  The first requirement for successful problem-solving is a clear and rational definition of the problem that is to be solved. This calls for clearly-defined variables and goals, addressing all aspects of the problem, hence the problem

AB  - [The article proposes an analytical perspective on artificial intelligence (AI) that can be fruitful in the sociology of work. The practical logic of new forms of AI (connectionist AI) is described as an interplay of social and technical processes of opening and closing possibilities of knowledge and action. In order to develop this argument, it is first shown in which sense AI can be understood as a contingency-generating technology in socio-technical contexts. The architecture based on neural networks is elaborated as a decisive feature of connectionist AI that not only opens up technical possibilities but can also shape social processes and structures by ‘selectivity’. However, this shaping does not take place solely on the part of the AI, but only becomes apparent in the interplay with specific restrictions that lie both in the social context of use and in the algorithmic architecture of the AI itself. For research in the sociology of work, this means that contingency theory approaches must be linked with approaches that emphasise the limits of (‘intelligent’) digitalisation. The yield of such a perspective is outlined in relation to the control of work with AI.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Scenarios are employed to address a large number of future environmental and socioeconomic challenges. We present a conceptual framework for the development of scenarios to integrate the objectives of different stakeholder groups. Based on the framework, land-use scenarios were developed to provide a common base for further research. At the same time, these scenarios assisted regional stakeholders to bring forward their concerns and arrive at a shared understanding of challenges between scientific and regional stakeholders, which allowed them to eventually support regional decision making. The focus on the integration of views and knowledge domains of different stakeholder groups, such as scientists and practitioners, required rigorous and repeated measures of quality control. The application of the integrative concept provided products for both stakeholder groups, and the process of scenario development facilitated cooperation and learning within both the scientist and practitioner groups as well as between the two groups.]

AB  - Within the Digital Humanities, a new interest in space, spatial concepts and spatialisation has emerged in recent years. On the one hand, this can be understood as part of the broader <em>spatial turn</em> in the social sciences and humanities that for the last 30 or so years argued for a closer attention to space. Part of this argument is the assumption that the social sciences and humanities have a tradition of neglecting space over time (Massey 1992). At the same time, this engagement with space and spatial modes of questioning raises particular questions and challenges for Digital Humanities. These questions

One of them, which this volume represents, explores what forms of knowledge might be constructed when creative writing encounters science. Working outwards from a theoretical framework that sees the sciences as discourses constructed by human endeavour through forms of language and practices of authority, it becomes possible to ask what forms of writing might emerge through scientific encounters. This is not so much a question of genre as it is a question about the relationship between creativity and scientific experiment, between the languages deployed by scientists in their experiments

AB  - [This article argues that research on social-ecological systems could profit from the use of ontologies. Ontologies, i.e. formalized conceptualisations of a domain in a computer-readable format, allow making progress in different areas. In particular, a diagnostic approach would be facilitated, in turn addressing the complexity problem (analysing the complexity of social-ecological systems adequately), the panacea problem (the overreliance on simplistic policy prescriptions that do not account for this complexity) and the scatter problem (lack of integration of many research findings into a cohesive set of theoretical statements). Ontologies offer several advantages, e.g. they structure and formalize domains, unify knowledge, decrease terminological confusion, reduce incomparability, reduce redundancy of efforts and allow automated reasoning. We demonstrate the practical use of ontologies by converting the SES framework into an ontology. This leads to several suggestions on how to improve the framework.]

Exceeding this border suddenly brought together into one essence two substances that before were not only different but unrelated, incommensurate. A collision that produced an entirely new

AB  - Housing is the contested terrain that stages the act of the negotiation of boundaries between competing ontologies, theoretical considerations, economic interests and political agendas, all of which are simultaneously pursued by individual incentives and result from the group dynamics of the participating actors. This book is the result of parallel conversations initiated during a series of conferences organised by the research organisation AMPS that were convened with the objective to rethink the transitive identity of the relationship between public-interlaced and private-singular spatial activities, in concert with the politics involved in housing.

AB  - Articles, blogs, and tweets about the digital humanities turn repeatedly, anxiously, and sometimes hopefully to the topic of utopia. But just what do digital humanists mean when they talk about utopia? The problem in describing any project as “utopian” is that there are always <em>other</em> utopias, an alterity within utopia itself that blurs its contours, making it less an island than an archipelago. Utopias can be systemic or iconoclastic, absolute or relative, abstract or concrete; they can be failed, fictional, ambiguous, or actually existing in the form of communes, phalansteries, or kibbutzim, and embodying a range of politics from anarchism

AB  - [Researchers and development practitioners in remote mountain areas rely on elevation data to study vegetation dynamics, natural hazards, land use, and other patterns. However, despite advances in technology, accurate digital elevation models (DEMs) with spatial resolution <30 m do not exist for most of the world's montane regions. We used a low-cost GPS-based protocol to construct a high-resolution (10 m) DEM for a rugged, remote mountain site in the northern Peruvian Andes. Elevation data were collected with handheld GPS units and combined with digitized and interpolated points within a Geographic Information System to generate a 10 m DEM. Additional DEMs were generated using 50%, 20%, and 15% of the surface points collected and from a 1:100,000 topographic map and ASTER GDEMv2 data. Estimated absolute vertical accuracy of the GPS surface-point DEMs was significantly lower than that of the ASTER GDEMv2 and topographic map DEMs. Relative vertical accuracy, a better measure of DEM quality, was considerably lower for all 6 DEMs than absolute vertical accuracy. Depending on project budget, time, and labor availability, this method can be used to produce DEMs with high spatial resolution and substantially improved relief maps for research, visualization, and communication purposes. Implementation of this method is practical in locations without access to electricity or postprocessing correction facilities, open-canopy land covers, and projects with small budgets that involve local participants.]

AB  - [Because of some landuse practices (such as overstocking with wild ungulates, historical clear-cuts for mining, and locally persisting forest pasture), protective forests in the montane vegetation belt of the Northern Limestone Alps are now frequently overaged and poorly structured over large areas. Windthrow and bark beetle infestations have generated disturbance areas in which forests have lost their protective functions. Where unfavorable site conditions hamper regeneration for decades, severe soil loss may ensue. To help prioritize management interventions, we developed a geographic information system-based model for assessing sensitivity to site degradation and applied it to 4 test areas in the Northern Limestone Alps of Austria and Bavaria. The model consists of (1) analysis of site conditions and forest stand structures that could increase sensitivity to degradation, (2) evaluation of the sensitivity of sites and stands, and (3) evaluation and mapping of mountain forests' sensitivity to degradation. Site conditions were modeled using regression algorithms with data on site parameters from pointwise soil and vegetation surveys as responses and areawide geodata on climate, relief, and substrate as predictors. The resulting predictor–response relationships were applied to test areas. Stand structure was detected from airborne laser scanning data. Site and stand parameters were evaluated according to their sensitivity to site degradation. Sensitivities of sites and stands were summarized in intermediate-scale sensitivity maps. High sensitivity was identified in 3 test areas with pure limestone and dolomite as the prevailing sensitivity level. Moderately sensitive forests dominate in the final test area, Grünstein, where the bedrock in some strata contains larger amounts of siliceous components (marl, mudstone, and moraines); degraded and slightly sensitive forests were rare or nonexistent in all 4 test areas. Providing a comprehensive overview of site and forest stand structure sensitivity to site degradation, our sensitivity maps can serve as a planning instrument for the management and protection of mountain forests.]

AB  - ABSTRACT Writing in the Disciplines curricula can both challenge and reinforce assumptions that writing is a general skill that students will already have learned prior to doing the specialized writing in their chosen field of study. Rhetorical genre studies, however, tends to emphasize the situated nature of writing expertise, and thus supports the exploration of more sustained and varied forms of writing instruction in higher education. This article reports on a qualitative study that gave priority to a rich source of pedagogical insight: student writers themselves. In-depth interviews and surveys were used to examine the pedagogical practices and curricular experiences identified by students as being most helpful in developing undergraduate expertise in their discipline's research genre. These student-centered descriptions of successful genre learning point the way toward curricular and instructional models that emphasize the intellectual, affective, and relational nature of writing.

It concludes by suggesting that the basic ideas presented might be useful to build operational early warning signals for critical transitions not only in irrigation systems but in a wider range of systems where tipping points are suspected to exist.]

TI  - Pro-Biafran Activists and the call for a Referendum
AU  - Nwofe, Emmanuel Sunday
AB  - [In a society bonded by a concatenation of diverse ethno-nationalism, the struggle for inclusion and exclusion becomes particularly unavoidable. Common among the findings of researchers of ethnic identities is the potential for conflicts when inequalities and injustices, rooted in ethnicity and religious identities are the basis for allocation of powers and resources. This is more threatening when a particular ethnic group is signposted as a threat to other group and targeted for ill-treatment. In Nigeria, the Igbo ethnic group is characterized as an endangered group and has risen at one point to challenge inequalities, injustices and state-orchestrated violence against the ethnic society that led to Nigeria-Biafra war between 1967 and 1970. Fifty years after the war, the Igbo ethnic society is still grappling to be included in the Nigeria nation-building project. The implication is a deep-rooted grievance among the Igbo ethnic group that the wave of campaigns and social movement for the restoration of Biafra continued to reverberate in recent times. After the UK ’s ‘Brexit’ vote, the pro-Biafra activists launched ‘Biafraexit’on Twitter in the style of ‘Brexit’ for a referendum to exit Nigeria. The purpose of this paper is to examine the major sentiment of the people about the Biafra restoration 50 years after the Biafran war. Through a sentiment analysis of ‘Biafraexit’, ‘free Biafra’ hashtags and the ‘Biafra’ search term on Twitter, the paper examines to what extent the perception of insecurity of lives of the Igbos constitute major concern of proponents of Biafran independent on Twitter? How have the human right abuses of pro-Biafra activists under President Buhari’s rule facilitated feelings of insecurity, religious cleansing and Islamization among pro-Biafra activists? The implications of this for cohesive nation-building are discussed.]

Section 1.2 first considers in more detail the differences between monosyndetic, polysyndetic and asyndetic coordinate structures. Section 1.3 investigates certain (presumed) properties of their coordinands, including co-occurrence restrictions on coordinands, their island behavior, recursivity of coordination, and the ability of coordinate structures to split, as in <em>Ik heb Peter gisteren gezien en Marie</em> ‘I saw Peter yesterday, and Marie’.

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Scientists are increasingly called upon to integrate across ecological and social disciplines to tackle complex coupled human and natural system (CHANS) problems. Integration of these disciplines is challenging and many scientists do not have experience with large integrated research projects. However, much can be learned about the complicated process of integration from such efforts. We document some of these lessons from a National Science Foundation-funded CHANS project (Forests, People, Fire) and present considerations for developing and engaging in coupled human and natural system projects. Certainly we are not the first to undertake this endeavor, and many of our findings complement those of other research teams. We focus here on the process of coming together, learning to work as an integrated science team, and describe the challenges and opportunities of engaging stakeholders (agency personnel and citizen communities of interests) in our efforts. Throughout this project our intention was to foster dialogue among diverse interests and, thus, incorporate this knowledge into uncovering primary social and ecological drivers of change. A primary tool was an agent-based model, Envision, that used this information in landscape simulation, visualization models, and scenario development. Although integration can be an end in itself, the proof of value in the approach can be the degree to which it provides new insights or tools to CHANS, including closer interaction among multiple stakeholders, that could not have been reached without it.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT This paper presents a disciplined approach to cyber risk assessment in distributed information systems. It emphasizes cyber vulnerability assessment in the architecture, specification and implementation—the knowledge of us—as a vital first step in estimating the consequence of information compromise in critical national security systems. A systematic methodology that combines information flow analysis and Byzantine failure analysis allows assessing the effects of information integrity compromises and the development of a Blue Book to guide cooperative Blue Team testing. The analysis of system vulnerability extends to cyber threats—the knowledge of them—leading to the development of a Red Book to inform adversarial Red Team testing. The paper concludes with a notional case study that illustrates this approach.]

AB  - [The intelligence community is facing a new type of organization, one enabled by the world’s information and communications infrastructure. These asyngnotic networks operate without leadership and are self-organizing in nature. They pose a threat to national security because they are difficult to detect in time for intelligence to provide adequate warning. Social network analysis and link analysis are important tools but can be supplemented by application of neuroscience principles to understand the forces that drive asyngnotic self-organization and triggering of terrorist events. Applying Living Systems Theory (LST) to a terrorist attack provides a useful framework to identify hidden asyngnotic networks. There is some antecedent work in propaganda analysis that may help uncover hidden asyngnotic networks, but computerized SIGINT methods face a number of challenges.]

AB  - Audiences for contemporary war films have been diminishing steadily over the course of the protracted U.S.-led military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. The conspicuously empty theater seats have been matched in living rooms by a similarly anemic viewership of war-oriented television programming. Media and war scholar Susan Carruthers rightly observes that along with fictionalized combat films, documentaries about the recent conflicts—whether they focus on the military, media, or civilian populations—have not fared much better, and that war entertainment’s absent audiences represent a clarion call for media and war scholars to contextualize and historicize this “attenuation of attention.”² In

AU  - Altier, Mary Beth

AB  - [Despite the growth of terrorism literature in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, there remain several methodological challenges to studying certain aspects of terrorism. This is perhaps most evident in attempts to uncover the attitudes, motivations, and intentions of individuals engaged in violent extremism and how they are sometimes expressed in problematic behavior. Such challenges invariably stem from the fact that terrorists and the organizations to which they belong represent clandestine populations engaged in illegal activity. Unsurprisingly, these qualities make it difficult for the researcher to identify and locate willing subjects of study—let alone a representative sample. In this research note, we suggest the systematic analysis of terrorist autobiographies offers a promising means of investigating difficult-to-study areas of terrorism-related phenomena. Investigation of autobiographical accounts not only offers additional data points for the study of individual psychological issues, but also provides valuable perspectives on the internal structures, processes, and dynamics of terrorist organizations more broadly. Moreover, given most autobiographies cover critical events and personal experiences across the life course, they provide a unique lens into how terrorists perceive their world and insight into their decision-making processes. We support our advocacy of this approach by highlighting its methodological strengths and shortcomings.]

AB  - Our systems, institutions, leaders, and narratives about who and what we are—our lack of compassion and limited definitions of what a valued member of society is—are failing us. They have been failing us for quite some time. Both COVID-19 and the uprising against systemic racism based on greed, fear, and territorialism are symptoms making visible the inequities that continually seethe just beneath the surface of “civil society.”  At this moment, we are unequivocally confronted with the need to reimagine our humanity and what it means to be living organisms sharing the planet many other organisms, some living, some

AB  - The previous chapter showed that literary quality in the eyes of the Dutch readers who participated in The National Reader Survey in 2013 was strongly linked to the perceived genre of a novel. Books labelled Romance in the research corpus received the lowest scores, those marketed as Literary novels generally received the highest scores, and Suspense sat in between. Continuing my quest in search of the conventions of literariness in the Netherlands in 2013, I will now focus on the category of Literary novels. As became clear in Chapter 3, Literary novels by female authors generally received lower scores than

AB  - As film culture increasingly morphs and in some ways dissolves into a broader media culture evolving around the production and circulation of digital moving images, concepts from computer science gain currency in film and media theory, and in film historiography. One such concept is scalability, which describes the potential of a system, network, or process to change scale, and, more specifically, the ability to change its scale continuously and adapt to future changes without affecting its basic structure and operating conditions. Usually, scalability refers to growth through marginal input or, in economic terms, to a type of growth in which

TI  - Contracting with Artificial Intelligence
AU  - Herbosch, Maarten
AB  - [Computer systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are an increasing presence in everyday legal practice. They may even be used to form contracts on behalf of their users. In such instances, it is not necessarily required that the system has been set up to take precise, pre-specified actions from an engineering perspective. As a result, the system may enter into contracts unforeseen by its user. This comes into friction with the requirements that contract formation depends on the contracting parties’intent to be bound or that a contract constitutes a meeting of the minds. It is obscure how the intent to form a specific contract or a meeting of the minds can be present if one of the parties may not even know that a particular contract is being entered into. To tackle this challenge, this article thoroughly examines the intent requirement in various legal systems. It becomes clear that the intent requirement is often loosely applied and that its role is formulated too generally, unnecessarily obstructing a straightforward application to contract formation via AI systems. Supplying nuance to the role of intent in contract formation helps clarify that the intent requirement is not in fact an obstacle to contract formation via AI systems. Auf künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) basierende Computersysteme sind in der täglichen Rechtspraxis immer häufiger anzutreffen. Sie können auch eingesetzt werden, um im Namen ihrer Nutzer Verträge zu schließen. Dabei ist es nicht unbedingt erforderlich, das System so einzurichten, dass es aus technischer Sicht präzise und im Voraus festgelegte Vorgänge auslöst. Somit kann das System vom Benutzer nicht vorhergesehene Verträge abschließen. Dies steht im Widerspruch zu den Erfordernissen, dass das Zustandekommen eines Vertrags vom Bindungswillen der Vertragsparteien abhängt und dass ein Vertrag eine Willensübereinstimmung darstellt. Unklar ist, wie der Wille, einen bestimmten Vertrag zu schließen, oder eine Willensübereinstimmung gegeben sein kann, wenn eine Partei gar nicht weiß, dass ein bestimmter Vertrag geschlossen wird. Dieser Artikel untersucht eingehend das Willenserfordernis in verschiedenen Rechtsordnungen. Dabei wird deutlich, dass dieses Erfordernis oft locker gehandhabt und seine Rolle zu allgemein gefasst wird. Eine differenziertere Betrachtung der Rolle des Willens beim Vertragsschluss stellt klar, dass das Willenserfordernis in der Tat kein Hindernis für den Vertragsschluss durch KI-Systeme darstellt.]

Inspired by Cao Yu’s 1934 play <em>Thunderstorm</em>, this version 2.0 borrowed the language of computer updates and interface enhancements while paring down the play to its bare essentials.¹ Cao Yu’s byzantine network of relationships and heavy-handed portrayal of an outdated social structure were replaced by a single love triangle between a man and two women. Onstage, in place of highly realistic scenery behind a fourth wall, were three separate box sets representing three different rooms in an early 1990s Beijing apartment.

AB  - [The management of natural resources may potentially be improved when governance structures in social-ecological systems enable coordination among multiple actors who may operate on the same or different geographic and/or governmental scales. In this article, we analyze the network of formal coordination ties that link governmental and nongovernmental actors in the Maumee River watershed, which is the largest source of phosphorus loading into Lake Erie, one of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a return of the seasonal harmful algal blooms (HAB) that were common in the 1960s and 1970s, and considerable research suggests that they might be triggered by excessive amounts of phosphorus produced by agriculture. Analyzing an assortment of documents that collectively detail how stakeholders relate to each other on the topic of nutrient management in the watershed, we examine who are the actors that are more likely to fulfill coordination roles, and the scales at which coordination takes place (vertically vs horizontally). Results suggest that coordination has been formalized vertically, with actors who operate at higher governmental levels being more likely to coordinate the activities of actors at lower levels. In addition, we see evidence of horizontal coordination but only in the confines of the individual state jurisdictions that share the watershed. We see this as a potentially important obstacle to solving the HABs problem in Lake Erie, given that the management of interjurisdictional watersheds is likely to be ineffective in the absence of proper coordination across the different jurisdictions that share the watershed.]

AB  - [The narrative-adventure game, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine (2018) is “a bleak American folk tale about traveling, sharing stories, and surviving manifest destiny,” whose objective is to introduce the player to voices formerly overshadowed or muted by the mainstream myth of the American dream. Players are tasked to find “the greatest stories,” that is “the ones people will tell you about their own lives,” meeting marginalized characters, like the migrant Mexican worker or the Navajo woman, as well as well-known figures of resistance, like Beat author Neal Cassady. Relying on Aubrey Anable’s definition of video games as affective systems, the article demonstrates that the player’s non-linear, rhizomic wandering results in a more accurate, affective cartography of the USA and provides the opportunity to tap into the experience of becoming posthuman via a marginalized avatar. Where the Water Tastes Like Wine thus aligns with the objectives of Rosi Braidotti’s critical posthumanism: it facilitates a different, more democratic future achieved by actualizing as political subjects of knowledge the “missing people,” who did not qualify as fully human according to the humanist idea of “man.” (IB)]

As conceptual and technical artifact, this living archive expresses an innovative model not only for the literary acts of reading, editing and writing, but also for reimagining the book as a network of reconfigurable and dynamic texts, structures, and actions. The programmed features of the LdoD Archive can be used in multiple activities, including leisure reading, study, analysis, advanced research, and creative writing. Through the integration of computational tools in a simulation space, this collaborative archive provides an open exploration of the procedurality of the digital medium itself. The “unfinished machine” metaphor suggests the open-endedness both of the evolving textual environment and of the computational modeling of literary performativity that sustains the whole experiment.]

AB  - In 2007, Reubens began gingerly appearing in public as Pee-wee again. He released the third Pee-wee film, <em>Pee-wee’s Big Holiday</em>, for Netflix in 2016. A digitally de-aged Reubens stars alongside Joe Manganiello of <em>Magic Mike</em> fame, who plays his new friend Joe in a thinly veiled queer love plot that culminates in exchanging friendship bracelets in a romantically lit tree house. Reubens was also touring a live Pee-wee stage show in March 2020 when Covid-19 lockdowns began, the character’s last major appearance before Reubens’s death in 2023. Pee-wee came back, to be sure, but that night at the theater left

TI  - Judge a Song by Its Cover: Cover Songs between Transformation and Extraction
AU  - Stanfill, Mel
AB  - Cover songs might seem out of place in a book about transformative musical works. They aren’t often compared to mash-ups or parodies because they are a thoroughly mainstream music industry practice. Covers don’t surface in the legal conversation because there is a compulsory mechanical license to produce recordings of a composition and so they don’t tend to provoke lawsuits. However, it’s precisely because cover songs are so normalized that I begin the book here: they do rework their source texts, and how that happens—and how it’s received—tells us a lot about popular beliefs around music, unmuddied by the

AB  - [This article explores how digital humanities (DH) projects, specifically the building of digital archives and digital exhibitions, can be implemented to preserve, reveal, and highlight previously invisibilized histories. This piece examines the construction of the Latino/a/x Issues Conference (LIC) archive at Bowling Green State University (BGSU), a public university in rural Northwest Ohio. This article, from the perspective of the archivist, explores the following research questions: How can DH archival projects reveal and preserve invisibilized histories of Latinx students at public universities against a series of constraints and serve as a means of (re) producing latinidad? This case study explores how to utilize the traditional form of the DH digital archive to document and preserve latinidad in institutional archives and advances the notion of digital archiving as a form of first-aid care to address the historical erasure of Latinx communities in institutional archival contexts. In doing so, this article critically examines the process of archiving the BGSU LIC as a means to consider the possibilities and limits of archival intervention, the production and preservation of memory, and the challenges and affordances of descriptive infrastructures that underlie archival work.]

AB  - [This study examined the current knowledge of Filipino college students on the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of the Philippines. The study included 75 college students during the academic year 2022-2023. Through a qualitative approach, the students submitted written essays anchored to the research questions. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative data, adhering to the stages of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The analysis resulted in the surfacing of various themes which are the result of this study: (1) Exposure to art forms, (2) association with indigenous people, (3) essence of values and practices, (4) misunderstandings about ICH, and (5) safeguarding of ICH. Students who came from the provinces experienced ICH through their festivities and local cultures, which are annual celebrations of various communities. There were also students who observed their locality’s people, handicrafts, and even familial behaviors. The presence of various art forms, performances, and experiences with indigenous peoples, and local traditions, regardless of whether it is within their families or communities, and their own knowledge of recent social issues unveiled the opportunities for the students to be exposed to the concept of Intangible Cultural Heritage and safeguard it. The author proposed a recommendation to further study and formulate a probable teaching and learning approach for college students to be more exposed to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Philippines.]

To address this, we explored the possibility of condensing qualitative information by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology, specifically Google’s NLP sentiment analysis. We employed a robust coding framework to test the validity of NLP-coded student feedback, analysing 1000 comments from the University’s 2021 course evaluations. Results show a statistical correlation between our sentiment analysis and NLP, offering promising evidence for NLP’s efficacy in providing accurate, high-level insights into student feedback sentiment.

AB  - In old-fashioned social history, the study of the ‘common landscape’ used to serve an index of social and cultural difference.¹ Take two regions, two neigh-bourhoods or two houses, side by side: their differences illuminate cultural ideas about hierarchy, the reality of divergent incomes, and separate relation-ships with the material world. Just so, the current volume invites us to conduct a survey of the ‘common landscape’ of digital history in all its variation.  ‘Field’ though it might be in name, the domain of history as practised by scholars of different methodological and political orientations, geographi-cal and temporal subjects of study, and

AB  - In reviewing the scholarship surrounding so-called fake news, one would out of necessity make a distinction between the dominant work on the art of influence campaigning and computational propaganda online and the consequences to date for its consumers, but also the few findings, often journalistic, in the relatively understudied case of the Dutch political space online, both on the web as well as in social media. Much work has been undertaken on the influence of Russian (and Russian-style) influence campaigning in the US, and the presence or absence thereof during elections in Germany, France, Sweden and elsewhere.

These technosciences, collectively also referred to as <em>information and communication technology</em> (ICT), are said to engender a revolution in human history, inaugurating the so-called Information Age, which will in turn give rise to an “information” or “knowledge” society.

While the ASA represents scholars with a diverse array of methodological approaches from a variety of disciplines, the society is a welcome home to academics whose work is interpretative and theoretical.

AU  - Azrolan, Jake

AU  - Siahatgar, Layla
AB  - In comparison to other mediums such as drawings and writings, photographs are considered by many to be pure representations of true events without fabrications or the interference of human bias. With the advent of AI and deepfakes, however, even images and human likenesses can be easily altered and edited, warping the truth and deteriorating the public’s trust in images, especially in the context of current events. While deepfake technology is still in its infancy, it has the potential to radically transform news, politics, and virtually any other media involving images. Coupled with that reality is the difficulty for both humans and detection softwares to detect AI images or image alterations. Consequently, in the realms of journalism, politics, and national security, AI images threaten to undermine sources of truthful information and perpetuate the erosion of trust in American institutions. Our project seeks to better understand the implications of deepfakes and AI images through a survey conducted using Muhlenberg College students; we wish to see people’s confidence in detecting AI images, their actual accuracy in detecting them, and their thoughts on regulation and other implications associated with altered images. Through this research we hope to better understand the public perception of deepfakes, threats the technology poses, and next steps to take in an AI-oriented future.

In her introductory editorial chapter, Lise Jaillant captures three main challenges faced by cultural heritage organizations: (1) dealing with scale, (2) unlocking “dark” archives, and (3) addressing the skills gap in data science and AI. In the process, she invites contributions that not only showcase compelling interdisciplinary case studies but also summon theoretical insights.  Let me expand on these three challenges, with

In addition, the chapter discusses the implications for discipline-based education research—that is, a methodological approach for performing education research in the classroom—along with opportunities for future work.  Hatano and Inagaki (1986) introduced the concept of adaptive expertise in their work with Japanese school children. Hatano and Inagaki described the process of how students learn and grow by following two courses of expertise: routine and adaptive. Routine expertise is often

In their theories of history, messianism, and cultural critique, Gershom Scholem, Franz Rosenzweig, and Siegfried Kracauer may not provide a systematic or unified answer to this question. But by returning to the project of negative mathematics that emerged in their work, I hope to show how the set of interdisciplinary tensions found there might shape theory today—theory, that is, that both draws on mathematics and remains rooted in

AU  - Varela, Miguel Escobar
AB  - Theater is bound in time and space more than many other artforms and more attention should be given to the geographic distribution of theater performances. This is an area where data is available in large quantities and computational methods are uniquely useful. Films and novels depend on specific, place-bound infrastructures: recording studios, book-signing events, awards ceremonies, etc. But the experience of reading and watching film is more distributed through time and place than experiencing theater events live. The visual arts have their own complex relationships to time and place, as artworks are created, sold, exhibited, and stolen in specific places.

Through computation, access to archives is made possible and often welcomed – through rectangular screens that mediate the archives contents or through interfaces and visualizations that reanimate a previously inert collection.

AB  - [This article argues that Cambridge Analytica was developed and operated with the primary objective of pushing far-right nationalist leaders who promoted neoliberal policies in favor of economic elites. Its origins, primary means of funding, and even its techniques were the results of its status as a subsidiary of SCL Group, a firm well entrenched within the military industrial complex and right-wing politics. Furthermore, an examination of many of its most prominent operations shows a long trail of support for right-wing ideologies. The case study of Cambridge Analytica contrasts the narrative that privatelycontracted disinformation companies are fringe, mercenary entities. Rather, the firm's political and military ties allowed it to not only operate as an influential political entity within the anglosphere, but all over the world.]

Why is common sense so trivial for humans but so hard for machines? In this essay, I map the twists and turns in recent research adventures toward commonsense AI. As we will see, the latest advances on common sense are riddled with new, potentially counterintuitive perspectives and questions. In particular, I discuss the significance of language for modeling intuitive reasoning, the fundamental limitations of logic formalisms despite their intellectual appeal, the case for on-thefly generative reasoning through language, the continuum between knowledge and reasoning, and the blend between symbolic and neural knowledge representations.]

Starting with Antigone, <em>phronēsis</em> grounds what become Western* traditions of civil disobedience and conscientious objection. At the same time, there are strong arguments that <em>phronēsis</em> is not computationally tractable (i.e., <em>phronēsis’s</em> processes and capabilities cannot be fully replicated by computational technologies and techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)). This will have important consequences for the uptake of VE as an increasingly central framework for

AB  - [Future changes in ecosystem services will depend heavily on changes in land cover and land use, which, in turn, are shaped by human activities. Given the challenges of predicting long-term changes in human behaviors and activities, scenarios provide a framework for simulating the long-term consequences of land-cover change on ecosystem function. As input for process-based models of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem function, we developed scenarios for land cover, population density, and impervious cover for the state of New Hampshire for 2020–2100. Key drivers of change were identified through information gathered from six sources: historical trends, existing plans relating to New Hampshire’s land-cover future, surveys, existing population scenarios, key informant interviews with diverse stakeholders, and input from subject-matter experts. Scenarios were developed in parallel with information gathering, with details added iteratively as new questions emerged. The final scenarios span a continuum from spatially dispersed development with a low value placed on ecosystem services (Backyard Amenities) to concentrated development with a high value placed on ecosystem services (the Community Amenities family). The Community family includes two population scenarios (Large Community and Small Community), to be combined with two scenarios for land cover (Protection of Wildlands and Promotion of Local Food), producing combinations that bring the total number of scenarios to six. Between Backyard Amenities and Community Amenities is a scenario based on linear extrapolations of current trends (Linear Trends). Custom models were used to simulate decadal change in land cover, population density, and impervious cover. We present raster maps and proportion of impervious cover for HUC10 watersheds under each scenario and discuss the trade-offs of our translation and modeling approach within the context of contemporary scenario projects.]

AU  - HEDLUND, JOHANNA

AU  - NOHRSTEDT, DANIEL
AB  - [The ability to effectively resolve complex environmental problems hinges upon the capacity to address several different challenges in concert. These challenges, what we refer to as policy issues, often relate to one another – they interdepend. Policy issue interdependency has been extensively theorised in the literature, yet few methodological approaches and little empirical evidence exist to translate the concept of policy issue interdependency to the on-the-ground realities facing policy actors in specific cases and contexts. We build from previous studies to develop a methodological procedure that investigates policy issue interdependencies in ways that take into account what measures and possible solutions policy actors have at their disposal in specific cases for specific environmental problems. By applying our methodological procedure to a case of water governance in Sweden, four insights emerged. First, validation by stakeholders confirms that our procedure produces reliable results. Second, we find that many, but certainly not all, policy issues are interdependent. More specifically, different patterns of policy issue interdependencies are associated with the biophysical and the governance spheres, respectively. Third, our results suggest that policy issue interdependencies are most important to consider when the overall level of interdependency is moderate. Last, our study raises new questions about policy actors’ perception of policy issue interdependencies. In particular, a key question for future research would be if reinforcing (win-win) or counteracting (trade-off) interdependencies are easier to comprehend and act on for policy actors.]

AB  - [The COVID-19 pandemic had a serious impact on developing various psychological stressors in society. Grounded in cognitive appraisal theory, the current study has been conducted to investigate the moderating role of Hindu religious coping in mitigating the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 in developing perceived stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among the Hindu residents in Bali, Indonesia. The current study contributed to the body of knowledge regarding religious practices acting as a coping mechanism to help the community cope with crises scenario such as COVID-19. Using a longitudinal field survey, data were collected at two different times from 423 Hinduism believers who actively practiced religion and lived in Bali, Indonesia. Data were analyzed using measurement and structural models in SmartPLS. Results revealed that the perceived threat of COVID-19 impacted a higher level of stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among the target sample. Results further depicted that the intensity of the perceived threat of COVID-19 to develop negative stressors among those individuals is low who believe in Hinduism and practice religious obligations on a regular basis. This reflects the moderating role of Hindu religious coping in decreasing stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression among Hindu believers aimed at COVID-19.]

AB  - Interview in three sessions with Susan Davis, division administrator for Caltech Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) from 1981 to 2012.  Ms. Davis briefly recaps her youth and education in New England, her work with economists at the University of Rochester, and her marriage to Caltech economist Lance Davis before moving into a discussion of her thirty-five years with Caltech’s Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), including more than three decades as division administrator.  She talks about the growth of the division’s undergraduate and graduate programs in the social sciences, the reactions this inspired within the division and across the Caltech campus, and discusses the relationship between social scientists and humanists within the division and with Caltech’s physical scientists.  She recounts her years working with division chairs R. Huttenback, R. Noll, D. Grether, J. Ledyard, J. Ensminger, and J. Katz and with numerous HSS personalities, and discusses the evolution and growth of HSS’s academic programs over nearly four decades.  She also talks about her service on Caltech staff committees and offers her personal perspective on changes in the campus environment and working conditions for staff, particularly staff women, over her years at Caltech.

Kosuth put his finger on the moment when art’s autonomy was finally separated from the philosophy of aesthetics, with a smug declaration signaling “the end of philosophy and the beginning of art.”³ The relevance of discrete, portable art objects receded,

AB  - [Abstract While autonomy is decision making independent of outside control, delegating authority for successfully dispersed and disaggregated operations is antithetical to our current practice. At one end of the spectrum of the human–machine interface is remote control—human input to generate a direct machine response with no authority granted to the machine to decide and act. At the opposite end of the spectrum, recourse to human supervision is absent and the machine intelligence can be exploited to its maximum potential by being freed to react to its environment. This is also the regime where the Department of Defense (DOD) would face the greatest organizational and cultural challenges in exploiting autonomy. The irony is that to harness the full potential of autonomy, we have to trust machines and free decision makers.]

AB  - Time is a difficult topic for historians. I remember an occasion when I was in the history department and I commented that—alluding to Koselleck—modern history not only is in time but also operates through it (1985: 246). This generated a rather snide comment from a colleague, a disgust with “theory,” which is the only explanation for something that needlessly complicates what is so obvious and commonsensical as time. This reaction adheres to the words of Bacon in the epigraph without recognizing the power that Bacon bequeaths to time. This conflation of chronology with absolute time parallels what Lefebvre

AB  - [Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems. Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts, transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures, and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts, traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena, enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.]

There are challenges too: procurement lags, data stovepiping, separating signal from noise, sources and methods, a range of normative issues, and central to managing these challenges, human capital. These potential applications and challenges are discussed and a closer look at what data scientists do in the Intelligence Community (IC) is offered. Effectively filling the ranks of the IC’s data science workforce will depend on the provision of well-trained data scientists from the higher education system. Program offerings at America’s top fifty universities will thus be surveyed (just a few years ago there were reportedly no degrees in data science). One Master’s program that has melded data science with intelligence is examined as well as a university big data research center focused on security and intelligence. This discussion goes a long way to clarify the prospective uses of data science in intelligence while probing perhaps the key challenge to optimal application of big data in the IC.]

AB  - [This paper explores a model-centred approach to augment the development and refinement of the theory of emergence. Its focus is on the relational process of leadership as an emergent event in complex human organisations. Emergence in complex organisations is a growing field of inquiry with many remaining research opportunities, yet a number of its central themes continue to be loosely connected to practical application and reliant on equivocal translations from root meaning. This paper offers a novel model of semantic conceptualisation of theory and phenomena with simulations to strengthen the theory–model–phenomenon link, building on the work of previous authors. Strengthening this link yields numerous applications, including making sense of complex organisational dynamics and supporting a wide range of theory-building research methods in applied social science and interdisciplinary research. The paper begins with a reflection on the main ideas of the theory of emergence, followed by discussion on prevalent model-centred approaches. A programme of semantic conceptualisation to expand real-world application of the theory of emergence is proposed.]

We propose that by democratizing data science and making it accessible to everyone, we can expand the breadth and depth of analytics available to a point where we can potentially meet the challenges of Big Data.]

AB  - I was contemplating “The Library of Babel” one night, considering how it treats language as a purely mechanical, combinatorial process, and thought — that would make a killer app. I created a website, libraryofbabel.info, that currently contains every possible page of 3,200 characters, using a character set of the twenty-six lower case letters, space, comma, and period. It has received some attention from the press, who tend to frame its existence as though technology has now made possible the reality of something that was previously only a fantasy. For example, the following appeared in a <em>Slate</em> article entitled, “Jorge Luis Borges’

AB  - As the only naturally reproducible green building material, wood has become the first choice when addressing environmental concerns. With the rapid development of laminated wood technologies and other production techniques, modern wood has become a high performance material with a large scale and low weight-to-strength ratio which demonstrates great potential in the future development of the construction industry (Menges, 2011). Digital design has marvellously expanded the scope of wood structure application. While the growing trend for research in robotic fabrication has accelerated the development of mass customisation concepts in architecture, the mass customisation of geometrically complex wooden elements has become

TI  - Optimal Income Taxation: Mirrlees Meets Ramsey

AU  - Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Research Department
AB  - What structure of income taxation maximizes the social benefits of redistribution while minimizing the social harm associated with distorting the allocation of labor input? Many authors have advocated scrapping the current tax system, which redistributes primarily via marginal tax rates that rise with income, and replacing it with a flat tax system, in which marginal tax rates are constant and redistribution is achieved via non-means-tested transfers. In this paper we compare alternative tax systems in an environment with distinct roles for public and private insurance. We evaluate alternative policies using a social welfare function designed to capture the taste for redistribution reflected in the current tax system. In our preferred specification, moving to the optimal flat tax policy reduces welfare, whereas moving to the optimal fully nonlinear Mirrlees policy generates only tiny welfare gains. These findings suggest that proposals for dramatic tax reform should be viewed with caution.

This essay provides a brief contextual history of the Association of American Universities’(AAU) effort to improve the effectiveness of undergraduate STEM education at member campuses and delineates the specific goals of this initiative. The essay then illuminates the essential role of the academic department and department chair in achieving long-lasting change and improving the quality of undergraduate education. It also discusses critical strategies and approaches for promoting the most effective methods for undergraduate STEM teaching and learning, with numerous examples from AAU member universities. The essay concludes with an acknowledgment of key challenges and opportunities that continue to face undergraduate education at research universities.]

AB  - To study language production, language comprehension, language representation and language acquisition means largely to ask what processes are involved, what mechanisms underlie and what factors contribute to the phenomena explored. Therefore the experiment is one of the most important methodological approaches within psycholinguistics. Its basic idea is to systematically manipulate certain variables while controlling for the effects of others – as a way of dealing with the problem of scientific <em>explanation</em>, as opposed to the problem of <em>description</em> (which is tackled by other methods). If we are to find out <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> something occurs, we need to compare different

AB  - [ABSTRACT. This Special Feature Volume examines the potential value of the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) as a methodological framework for the transition to sustainable development in coastal zones. This article provides insight on the Systems Approach, the theory behind it, and how its practical application to coastal zone systems (CZSs) was developed. The SAF is about information for management through a focus on how to generate a higher, dynamic level of information about complex CZSs and how to render this information more useful to end users through a participatory suite of communication methods. The SAF is an open research methodology that investigates the function of systems in order to simulate specific issues or questions concerning their function. The research articles that are included in this Volume demonstrate examples of coupled multidisciplinary methods integrated into SAF simulations appropriate to a selected policy issue and to the social-environmental conditions of each Study Site Application. Their findings are not the result of funded research projects; instead, they are by-products of pilot applications conducted to develop and improve the SAF methodology. The final article of this Volume synthesizes these results in the context of the SAF as a higher level instrument for integrated coastal zone management.]

It has already been hinted that such an account depends on seeing all as mathematizable, seeing the holy Name as the primary bit of information. In this way, it will not be enough to evoke this idea, but rather we need to formulate a clear ontological model for it.

A random sample of 16 male and 28 female freshmen students at An-Najah National University was trained on how to monitor their reading comprehension for almost five weeks while they were studying a reading comprehension unit in a freshman English course. Mokhtari and Reitchard (2002) scale of Monitoring Reading Comprehension was administered to the sample twice: before and after training. Two tests measuring the students' learning of the reading units were administered: before and after training. The scores in English on the Tawjihi Exam were taken as a measurement of the students' proficiency in English (85% and above - high proficiency, 65% and below - low proficiency). The students' gender (male/female) and stream on the Tawjihi (scientific/literary) were also studied as independent variables. The Repeated Measure Design by using "t" test and "F" test for dependent samples at (p< .05) level of significant was conducted. The "Pearson r" correlation was used for computing the relationship between the reading comprehension scale and unit test scores. The analysis showed the following results: 1- The average on monitoring reading comprehension was 3.71 before training and rose significantly to 3.79 after training (p < .05). 2- The average on problem solving strategies (x = 4.04) was significantly higher (p < .0001) than the average of reading support strategies (x = 3.4) and global reading strategies (x = 3.65) before training; whereas, the average on reading support strategies (x = 3.56) became significantly (p < .0001) higher than that of problem solving strategies (x = 2.74) and global reading strategies (x = 2.97) after training. 3- There was a significant correlation between students' scores on monitoring reading comprehension scale and their scores on the unit test. But the correlation fell from (r = .35) before training to (r = .29) after it. 4- There was a significant correlation between students' scores on the monitoring reading comprehension scale and their score in English on the Tawjihi Exam. But the correlation fell slightly from (r = .40) before training to (r = .37) after it. 5- The students with high proficiency in English scored higher on monitoring reading comprehension ( x = 3.91) than those with low proficiency (x = 3.43). 6- The students from the Twajihi scientific stream scored higher on monitoring reading comprehension (x = 4.35) than literary stream students (x = 3.71), though the differences were not significant but approached significance (0.13). 7- The training program helped low proficiency students but not high proficiency ones. 8- The analysis did not show any significant difference in monitoring reading comprehension with respect to students' gender (male vs. female).]

AB  - [High mountains have sensitive social-ecological systems (SESs) characterized by fragility, complexity, and marginality. The local economies of these environments mainly rely on primary production, tourism, and leisure activities; thus human–ecosystem interactions are intricately linked. Many authors stress that this strict relationship must be assisted with a participatory approach involving interested stakeholders in the conceptualization, specification, and synthesis of knowledge and experience into useable information for the express purpose of addressing a problem complex. This paper presents experience garnered with a participatory modeling framework combining hard and soft methodology in 2 case studies: the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (Nepal) and the Central Karakoram National Park (Pakistan). The modeling framework was developed based on local stakeholders' demands and needs; it consists of 5 modules, briefly presented here along with their conceptual background. In developing the framework, particular emphasis was given to considering the needs of decision-makers at the local level, rather than simply providing technical solutions to abstract problems. From the development of this modeling process, a need emerged to structure a management-oriented research module in order to generate management knowledge that is both stakeholderrelevant and evidence-based. The application of the framework in the 2 cases studies showed that the modeling can trigger valuable discussion among stakeholders as well as guidance for management-oriented research and feedback loops ensuring validation of knowledge. In addition, the resulting scenarios can help decision-makers in defining pathways for sustainable development in mountain areas, where people's livelihoods are closely dependent on ecosystems. The framework was developed in such a way that it can be replicated in other mountain areas with similar challenges.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Mental models are personal, internal representations of external reality that people use to interact with the world around them. They are constructed by individuals based on their unique life experiences, perceptions, and understandings of the world. Mental models are used to reason and make decisions and can be the basis of individual behaviors. They provide the mechanism through which new information is filtered and stored. Recognizing and dealing with the plurality of stakeholder’s perceptions, values, and goals is currently considered a key aspect of effective natural resource management (NRM) practice. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of how mental models internally represent complex, dynamic systems and how these representations change over time will allow us to develop mechanisms to enhance effective management and use of natural resources. Realizing this potential, however, relies on developing and testing adequate tools and techniques to elicit these internal representations of the world effectively. This paper provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of the literature that has contributed to the theoretical development and practical application of the mental model construct. It explores the utility and applicability of the construct in the context of NRM and includes a review of elicitation techniques used within the field. The major theoretical and practical challenges that arise in drawing on the construct to provide a cognitive dimension to NRM are also addressed.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Comprehensive problem framing that includes different perspectives is essential for holistic understanding of complex problems and as the first step in building models. We involved five stakeholders to frame the management problem of the Central Baltic herring fishery. By using the Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) approach, the views of the stakeholders were built into graphical influence diagrams representing variables and their dependencies. The views of the scientists involved concentrated on biological concerns, whereas the fisher, the manager, and the representative of an environmental nongovernmental organization included markets and fishing industry influences. Management measures were considered to have a relatively small impact on the development of the herring stock; their impact on socioeconomic objectives was greater. Overall, the framings by these stakeholders propose a focus on socioeconomic issues in research and management and explicitly define management objectives, not only in biological but also in social and economic terms. We find the approach an illustrative tool to structure complex issues systematically. Such a tool can be used as a forum for discussion and for decision support that explicitly includes the views of different stakeholder groups. It enables the examination of social and biological factors in one framework and facilitates bridging the gap between social and natural sciences. A benefit of the BBN approach is that the graphical model structures can be transformed into a quantitative form by inserting probabilistic information.]

AB  - In his contribution to the first issue of<em>Memory Studies</em> , Jeffrey Olick notes that despite “the mutual affirmations of psychologists who want more emphasis on the social and sociologists who want more emphasis on the cognitive,” in fact “actual cross-disciplinary research . . . has been much rarer than affirmations about its necessity and desirability.”¹ The peculiar, contingent disciplinary divisions that structure our academic institutions create and enable many powerful intellectual cultures, but memory researchers are unusually aware that uneasy faultlines and glaring gulfs lie in the uncertain zones between them. The processes of memory are simultaneously natural and cultural.

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Feedback mechanisms are important in the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of social-ecological systems, as well as in the analysis of livelihoods, but how to evaluate systems with direct feedbacks has been a great challenge. We applied fuzzy cognitive mapping, a tool that allows analysis of both direct and indirect feedbacks and can be used to explore the vulnerabilities of livelihoods to identified hazards. We studied characteristics and drivers of rural livelihoods in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area in southern Africa to assess the vulnerability of inhabitants to the different hazards they face. The process involved four steps: (1) surveys and interviews to identify the major livelihood types; (2) description of specific livelihood types in a system format using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), a semi-quantitative tool that models systems based on people’s knowledge; (3) linking variables and drivers in FCMs by attaching weights; and (4) defining and applying scenarios to visualize the effects of drought and changing park boundaries on cash and household food security. FCMs successfully gave information concerning the nature (increase or decrease) and magnitude by which a livelihood system changed under different scenarios. However, they did not explain the recovery path in relation to time and pattern (e.g., how long it takes for cattle to return to desired numbers after a drought). Using FCMs revealed that issues of policy, such as changing situations at borders, can strongly aggravate effects of climate change such as drought. FCMs revealed hidden knowledge and gave insights that improved the understanding of the complexity of livelihood systems in a way that is better appreciated by stakeholders.]

AB  - [Wildland fire suppression practices in the western United States are being widely scrutinized by policymakers and scientists as costs escalate and large fires increasingly affect social and ecological values. One potential solution is to change current fire suppression tactics to intentionally increase the area burned under conditions when risks are acceptable to managers and fires can be used to achieve long-term restoration goals in fire adapted forests. We conducted experiments with the Envision landscape model to simulate increased levels of wildfire over a 50-year period on a 1.2 million ha landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon, USA. We hypothesized that at some level of burned area fuels would limit the growth of new fires, and fire effects on the composition and structure of forests would eventually reduce future fire intensity and severity. We found that doubling current rates of wildfire resulted in detectable feedbacks in area burned and fire intensity. Area burned in a given simulation year was reduced about 18% per unit area burned in the prior five years averaged across all scenarios. The reduction in area burned was accompanied by substantially lower fire severity, and vegetation shifted to open forest and grass-shrub conditions at the expense of old growth habitat. Negative fire feedbacks were slightly moderated by longer-term positive feedbacks, in which the effect of prior area burned diminished during the simulation. We discuss trade-offs between managing fuels with wildfire versus prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatments from a social and policy standpoint. The study provides a useful modeling framework to consider the potential value of fire feedbacks as part of overall land management strategies to build fire resilient landscapes and reduce wildfire risk to communities in the western U.S. The results are also relevant to prior climate-wildfire studies that did not consider fire feedbacks in projections of future wildfire activity.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Developing scenarios to explore possible environmental futures is a widely used tool in social-ecological research. Scenario planners working in environmental systems increasingly enlist stakeholders to help develop scenarios, but effectively integrating stakeholder participation with scenario analyses and modeling remains a challenge. Using the New England Landscape Futures project as a case study, we explore how a method for codesigning a scenario elicitation process can be used to help balance the needs of both stakeholders and scientists. To illustrate the design process, we document eight influential decisions made with stakeholder input, describe the competing demands that we negotiated, and outline the rationale for the selected approach. We find that three priorities drove most of our decisions: maximizing stakeholder involvement in the scenario development process, efficient use of stakeholder time, and research needs. The outcome was a robust, intense, and highly structured one-day scenario development protocol that engaged stakeholders in the full scenario development process from initial orientation and identification of driving forces through to fleshedout scenarios narratives and quantitative inputs able to inform land-use simulations. Its deployment in six state-specific workshops was successful in eliciting divergent scenarios that stakeholders perceived as being plausible and relevant. Stakeholder responses to the process were positive, though also reflected the compromises made during the codesign process. Research needs were largely met, though initial expectations likely exceeded what could reasonably be elicited from a stakeholder group in one day. Our experiences highlight the importance of process design and how selection of scenario development techniques should follow from the project objectives, problem context, and stakeholder preferences for engagement activities. The use of a codesign framework that recognizes the challenges involved and engages stakeholders in the design process can act as a shared learning experience and contribute to greater effectiveness and impact for participatory social-ecological scenario processes.]

AB  - Research indicates that testing is associated with a variety of changes in educators’ practices (and, as we will discuss in Chapter Four, these changes are influenced by a number of factors). To understand how the widespread adoption of new, CCSS-aligned assessments would be likely to influence students’ experiences in schools and classrooms, it is important to consider the range of common responses to testing and the ways in which these might be shaped by a shift from current testing practices to an approach to assessment that emphasizes deeper learning. In this chapter, we summarize what is known about test-induced changes

AB  - In the academic study of religion the term “sects” is usually reserved for minority religious groups whose beliefs and ritual behaviors are considered (by a majority population) to be abnormal, in contrast to more conventional religious groups such as “churches.” Groups that are able to continue reproducing themselves until they are adopted by a dominant culture (as with early 4th century Christianity) or at least adapt to it (as with early 21st century Mormonism), are no longer considered <em>sects</em>.

AU  - Giaimo, Stefano

AU  - Baudisch, Annette
AB  - [BACKGROUND Demographic heterogeneity refers to the observation that – within the same population – trajectories of survival and reproduction differ substantially between individuals. These differences have been found in both natural and captive populations. Models in ecology and evolution that incorporate demographic heterogeneity can improve both our understanding of the evolution of mortality curves and our population management abilities. Current explanations of the origin of demographic heterogeneity mostly revolve around interindividual differences that are either present at birth (fixed heterogeneity) or the result of stochasticity in life history realization (dynamic heterogeneity). Largely neglected remains the possibility that a form of fixed heterogeneity may evolve from interactions between behaviorally distinct individuals through their lifespan. OBJECTIVE We suggest one possible way in which heterogeneity in vital rates may evolve. Our approach assumes game theoretic interactions in the population. METHODS We combine population matrix models and game theory. We study a stable coexistence game between two types that are initially demographically homogeneous and analyze the effect of mutations that influence the trajectories of survival and reproduction. RESULTS The rise and fixation of mutations can make the population demographically heterogeneous, while the game can preserve the coexistence of different types in the population. CONCLUSIONS Frequency-dependent selection can help to explain the evolution of demographic heterogeneity. CONTRIBUTION Frequency-dependent selection can maintain already existing demographic heterogeneity in a population without overlapping generations. Here, we show that this form of selection can also be involved in the origin of a form of fixed heterogeneity.]

TI  - Industrial Landscapes Lost in the Wild: Creating a Methodology for the Remote Identification of Charcoal Hearths
AU  - Conner, Weston
AB  - This project examined industrial landscapes hidden within State Game Lands #217, near Palmerton, Pennsylvania. During the mid and late nineteenth century, extensive tracts of forests were felled and converted into charcoal to power iron furnaces. In the Lehigh Valley, this impact was felt on the Blue Mountain near two furnaces started by the Balliet family. This mountain remains covered in charcoal hearths, a testament to its past industrial use. This project developed a methodology for remote identification of charcoal hearths utilizing QGIS and LiDAR data, alongside multiple rounds of systematic pedestrian survey to ground-truth potential hearths. Special attention was given to hearths located on flat spaces, which were more difficult to identify. Through this survey and methodology, the hidden industrial landscape of State Game Lands #217 came to be better understood and its current perception problematized.

Of particular importance are the exclusions and concentrations that are increasingly manifest, and relatedly the increasing inequalities that have been identified within the advanced capitalist paradigm.

AB  - In everyday life, “local” is often taken for granted. It is self-evidently proximate and perhaps intimate: it is simply “here” or “there”. When someone “cares” about a local place – which can range from deep worry to disinterested awareness (Dreyfus 1991, 238) – they do so on the basis of being thrown into their own local world. Stiegler’s (2012) related notion of “attention”, however, adds an important proviso to this kind of Heideggerian formulation about care. It suggests that a capacity to attend to any object (such as a locality) is always already exteriorized into various technical objects and infrastructures. A locality

AB  - [Aim:Abiotic, biotic and dispersal factors interact to shape species distributions. At broad geographic extents, abiotic factors are thought to exert the greatest influence on the distribution, while biotic and dispersal factors strongly influence the distribution regionally and locally. We test whether reproductive traits relating to biotic and dispersal factors explain differences between estimated potential and occupied geographic distributions for 21 species of Trillium. Location:Eastern North America. Methods:Fundamental niches and associated predicted suitable distributions were estimated using climate-calibrated ecological niche models. We defined occupied distributions as the intersection between known ranges and predicted suitable areas (PSAs). Proportional occupancy of the predicted suitable distribution (PO) was calculated by dividing the area of the occupied distribution by the PSA. We related reproductive traits (ovule number, seed set, number of seeds/plant, seed mass, adult biomass, flower type: sessile/pedicellate) to PO using beta regression models. AICc was used to assess model fit. Results:There was considerable variation in PO across species (1.1%–96%, mean = 51%). Eighty-five percent of species with PO < 60% were sessile; 88% of species with PO > 60% were pedicellate. The best-fit beta regression (pseudo R2 = .70) yielded significantly lower PO for sessile-flowered species; ovule number and seed mass were also significant predictors of PO. Main conclusions:Variation in PO among study species can be explained by flower type, ovule number and seed mass—biotic traits related to dispersal ability. We posit that variation in dispersal potential stemming from primary and long-distance dispersers is related to occupancy of the predicted suitable distribution in Trillium. We exemplify a scenario in which life history traits explain why some species are range-restricted when their close relatives are widespread. Our methodology constitutes a powerful comparative framework that can be applied to diverse biological systems to inform conservation of rare species.]

Used to signify buildings and cities as the collective outcome of society, the notion of the “built environment” characterises scientific, behavioural, or computational approaches to knowledge, which are increasingly gaining strength in architectural research

AB  - [This paper will investigate how settler colonialism is extended online through the Internet, becoming “digital settler colonialism”, a term I have coined, that then encourages white supremacist violence offline. Digital settler colonialism, I argue, refers to the production, maintenance and use of the Internet to extend settler colonialism and reiterate the power of the white sovereign online. The white cursor of technology, the Internet, becomes a tool used to “eliminate the native”, Indigenous subjects, and in addition, to “exterminate the Other”, such as Black and racialised Muslim subjects, to extend the legacy of the white settler state. Where we understand that settler colonialism both marks the racialised body and colonises land, I argue that the Internet extends this through its digital operations while appearing racially neutral. This will be evidenced through the exploration of independently archived computer mediated material and drawing on disciplines of whiteness, settler colonial and critical race and Internet studies to purport that studies of racism online necessitate a media and race specific approach that is encompassing of the offline structures that maintain racial violence. I direct my attention to systems that can reiterate the settler state – such as the Internet – rather than Internet users, investigating to what extent settler colonialism is built into the Internet.]

Across the political spectrum, from #BLM, #StopTheSteal or #GameStop, three core pillars of US society provide the institutional points of reference for the latest round of organised critique: the police, democracy and finance capital (see Stalder 2021). Rolling these distinct movements into a mashup manifesto against nihilistic fatalism is Inhabit, a distinctively North American formation cultivating attention to build a movement of the disaffected.¹ Seeking to galvanise millennials in search of a cause, Inhabit sets out ‘Path B’, a political tract with something for everyone: climate justice, collective care, autonomous infrastructures, planning hubs,

Sviluppare l’intelligenza visiva e nutrire il pensiero analitico con il lavoro manuale non richiedeva il linguaggio verbale, fu altresì la lacuna linguistica a spingere Albers a sperimentare altri mezzi espressivi, un esagerato uso del corpo – gesti, sospiri, smorfie del viso, passi di danza – dove convergevano la parola e l’azione, guidate dal flusso delle sensazioni interne e dall’istinto¹.

AB  - [BACKGROUNDAutomated text analysis is widely used across the social sciences, yet the application of these methods has largely proceeded independently of qualitative analysis. OBJECTIVEThis paper explores the advantages of applying automated text analysis to augment traditional qualitative methods in demography. Computational text analysis does not replace close reading or subjective theorizing, but it can provide a complementary set of tools that we believe will be appealing for qualitative demographers. METHODSWe apply topic modeling to text data from the Malawi Journals Project as a case study. RESULTSWe examine three common issues that demographers face in analyzing qualitative data: large samples, the challenge of comparing qualitative data across external categories, and making data analysis transparent and readily accessible to other scholars. We discuss ways that new tools from machine learning and computer science might help qualitative scholars to address these issues. CONCLUSIONSWe believe that there is great promise in mixed-method approaches to analyzing text. New methods that allow better access to data and new ways to approach qualitative data are likely to be fertile ground for research. CONTRIBUTIONSNo research, to our knowledge, has used automated text analysis to take an explicitly mixed-method approach to the analysis of textual data. We develop a framework that allows qualitative researchers to do so.]

Even if the analysis does not get seduced by the pathology discourse, it tends to focus on identity formation without questioning the conceptual premises behind psychological discourses. Personal-identity-formation theories found in any traditional psychology textbook have in common the premise that identity is forged in social relations, that is, through contact with the other.

AB  - [Abstract: This paper assesses the embedding of land use and transport instruments—Planning Support Systems (PSS), models and tools—in Dutch planning practice, in order to shed light on how planning practitioners perceive these instruments and to ascertain the reasons and manner of their (lack of ) utilization. These insights provide much-needed input to improve support instruments for integrated land use and transport planning, particularly during early planning phases and on the regional level. The research adds to the emerging literature on PSS. It builds on general insights into bottlenecks that block the use of PSS in practice, and employs a user-oriented approach to gain more insight into how users perceive these bottlenecks and how they relate to specific land use and transport PSS. Much of the existing research geared toward improving these instruments has a technical focus on adjusting the intrinsic workings of the instruments themselves. However, the way in which they are embedded in planning practice has remained largely ignored and poorly understood. Based on data from a web-based survey administered to land use and transport practitioners in the spring of 2007, this paper describes how LUT instruments are embedded in planning practice and how they are perceived by the planning actors in land use and transport planning. The findings suggest that a technical focus is insufficient to improve the implementation of these instruments. The key bottlenecks, identified by the survey, actually are centered on "softer issues," such as lack of transparency and poor connections to the planning process. The closing analysis and discussion offer some potential remedies for these shortcomings.]

AB  - The algorithm is perhaps the concept most central to rhetorical code studies, and it is necessary to examine how algorithmic procedures are related to humanistic scholarship in general and to rhetoric in particular. This relationship can be demonstrated by tracing a path from the origins of the algorithm through its adoption from mathematics by computer science and engineering to its role in the critical work of humanities research. Following this brief history of the algorithm and its connection to humanistic work is an interrogation of how the algorithm plays an integral role in rhetorical activity. Such activity can be understood

AB  - Will man sich den Fragen der Bildung unter den Bedingungen des Digitalen zuwenden, dann wird dies mindestens aus zwei Gründen recht herausfordernd. Erstens scheint es keine leichte Aufgabe zu sein, das Digitale als Konzept in seiner Heterogenität stichhaltig zu erfassen, denn es ist von Bewegung geprägt. Bewegung in doppelter Weise, einerseits verändern digitale Architekturen und deren Infrastrukturen die Weisen, wie wir Welt wahrnehmen, Kommunikation, Arbeit und Leben gestalten und andererseits verändert sich das Digitale selbst. Bewegungen liegen dem Digitalen gewissermaßen als inhärente Eigenschaft zu Grunde. Dabei ist die Grammatik des Digitalen hochgradig ambivalent. Einerseits beruht im Grunde alles auf den
