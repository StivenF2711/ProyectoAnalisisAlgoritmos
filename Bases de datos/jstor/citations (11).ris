AB  - An ambitious project was initiated in 2002 and concluded by 2007 by Finnish economic and business historians to analyse digitised news agency data in order to create a model to predict the behaviour of business enterprises. This project, entitled MetaSignal (later MetaAlert), was a joint venture between historians, journalism researchers, engineering scholars and economists working at the University of Jyväskylä and the Tampere University of Technology. The aim was nothing less ambitious than to create an artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn from the past to predict the future. The AI was intended to compile automatically, categorise and analyse avail-able

AB  - How is extinction being understood, witnessed, and debated in the early twenty-first century? What are the limits of determinism in conceiving its complexity? What other sorts of useful imaginaries, past and present, grapple with increasingly unpredictable and physically incoherent realities linked to a changing climate? These are some of the questions this essay addresses as it critically explores how the pinning of life within a predictable or deterministic process obstructs scientific reasoning about how ecosystems come under threat in an age of climate change. Specifically, it addresses the problem of surprising, even catastrophic, shifts in nature’s ecologies, and explores some

The concept will be used as an umbrella term denoting a variety of interrelated terms. It refers to a range of relational notions such as ‘clustering’, ‘coexistence’, ‘collective’, and ‘connectivity’, although each of these notions stresses a slightly different aspect of community.

Boccioni’s city rises with the relentless drive for modernization that coloured the Futurist movement, its vision writ large across the smokestacks and construction scaffolding in the painting’s background as, in the foreground, human (read as male) labour harness horses and machines towards their dream of industrial and technological development.

The system needs to consider when a writer needs feedback. No writer likes to be interrupted when searching for an expression, or finishing a sentence or a phrase. However spell

AB  - Recent events such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, power outages, and the threat of pandemics have highlighted our vulnerability to natural disasters. This vulnerability is exacerbated by many organizationsâ€™ increasing dependence on computer, telecommunications, and other technologies, and trends toward integrating suppliers and business partners into everyday business operations. In response many organizations are implementing disaster recovery planning processes. In this paper we discuss how to identify threats and scenarios; how to articulate the disaster recovery strategies; and four elements of the generic disaster recovery plan: Mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. We then provide examples of software that can help disaster recovery professionals in the planning and implementation process. Finally we present some trends that will reinforce the criticality of the issue.

Dynamic topic models, for example, are often constructed temporally year by year, which makes it possible to track and analyse the ways in which topics change over time.² This chapter provides a case example on 2 topic modelling historical primary sources.

The site has indeed as its slogan: ‘self-knowledge through numbers’.¹ Such a self-knowledge was promoted by the manual collection of numbers on one’s body functioning, which were analysed thanks to tools of analysis offered in the site. The founders also encouraged the construction of communities where people would share their calculation and insights with others, thus helping each other to get a better understanding of their quantified bodies.

AU  - Borick, Christopher P.
AU  - Rabe, Barry G.
AB  - During the past two years, public perceptions of global warming have shifted significantly in the United States. A number of 2007 national surveys reveal that Americans increasingly acknowledge global warming’s existence and believe anthropogenic factors are its cause. Another national survey in spring 2008 shows that the number of Americans who believe that there is significant evidence of global warming may have declined. These shifts in public opinion have been widely discussed in the media and academia, but little is actually known about what drives individual views on global warming. Do personal experiences impact views (e.g. hotter temperatures in their state)? Does existing evidence presented in national media (e.g. melting glaciers), scientific projections (e.g. computer modeling), dramatic experiences (e.g. disastrous hurricanes or award-winning films), or some combination of these factors influence public beliefs?

With the techno-magical apparatus of motion pictures, we too can come into contact with a “more perfect perfection” of the real world by allowing our ravished eyes to pass through “a new kind of Space, with a wake of its own” (89).
