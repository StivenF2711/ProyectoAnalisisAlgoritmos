AB  - Graph analytics is becoming increasingly popular, driving many important business applications from social network analysis to machine learning. Since most graph data is collected in a relational database, it seems natural to attempt to perform graph analytics within the relational environment. However, SQL, the query language for relational databases, makes it difficult to express graph analytics operations. This is because SQL requires programmers to think in terms of tables and joins, rather than the more natural representation of graphs as collections of nodes and edges. As a result, even relatively simple graph operations can require very complex SQL queries. In this paper, we present GRAPHiQL, an intuitive query language for graph analytics, which allows developers to reason in terms of nodes and edges. GRAPHiQL provides key graph constructs such as looping, recursion, and neighborhood operations. At runtime, GRAPHiQL compiles graph programs into efficient SQL queries that can run on any relational database. We demonstrate the applicability of GRAPHiQL on several applications and compare the performance of GRAPHiQL queries with those of Apache Giraph (a popular `vertex centric' graph programming language).

AB  - The selective attention mechanism is employed by humans and primates to realize a truly intelligent perception system, which has the cognitive capability of learning and thinking about how to perceive the environment autonomously. The attention mechanism involves the top-down and bottom-up ways that correspond to the goal-directed and automatic perceptual behaviors, respectively. Rather than considering the automatic perception, this paper presents an artificial system of the goal-directed visual perception by using the object-based top-down visual attention mechanism. This cognitive system can guide the perception to an object of interest according to the current task, context and learned knowledge. It consists of three successive stages: preattentive processing, top-down attentional selection and post-attentive perception. The preattentive processing stage divides the input scene into homogeneous proto-objects, one of which is then selected by the top-down attention and finally sent to the post-attentive perception stage for high-level analysis. Experimental results of target detection in the cluttered environments are shown to validate this system.

AB  - The widespread adoption of algorithmic decision-making systems has brought about the necessity to interpret the reasoning behind these decisions. The majority of these systems are complex black box models, and auxiliary models are often used to approximate and then explain their behavior. However, recent research suggests that such explanations are not overly accessible to lay users with no specific expertise in machine learning and this can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the underlying model. In this article, we show that a predictive and interactive model based on causality is inherently interpretable, does not require any auxiliary model, and allows both expert and non-expert users to understand the model comprehensively. To demonstrate our method we developed Outcome Explorer, a causality guided interactive interface, and evaluated it by conducting think-aloud sessions with three expert users and a user study with 18 non-expert users. All three expert users found our tool to be comprehensive in supporting their explanation needs while the non-expert users were able to understand the inner workings of a model easily.

AB  - In the field of neuroscience, brain activity measurement and analysis are considered crucial areas. Schizophrenia (Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects the thinking, behavior, and feelings of people worldwide. Thus, an accurate and rapid detection method is needed for proper care and quality treatment of the patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz detection as it records brain activities. This article aims to improve the performance of EEG-based Sz detection using a deep-learning approach in remote applications. A hybrid deep-learning model identified as schizophrenia hybrid neural network (SzHNN), which is a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), has been proposed wherein the CNN for local feature extraction and LSTM for classification is utilized. In this article, the proposed model has been compared with several deep-learning and machine-learning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different datasets wherein dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and dataset 2 consists of 16 subjects. The proposed model is also implemented with the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare and remote-based applications. Several experiments have been conducted using various parametric settings on different frequency bands and different sets of electrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the proposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of 99.9% compared to other implemented models and existing models of previous papers. The proposed model overcomes the influence of different frequency bands and shows a better accuracy of 96.10% (dataset 1) and 91.00% (dataset 2) with only five electrodes. Subject-wise testing is also done for SzHNN, which proposes an accuracy of 90.11% and 89.60% for datasets 1 and 2, respectively.

AB  - There are some subjects that are seen as a challenge by both students and teachers. One of these subjects is Software Engineering, where the novelty of its concepts and the need of applying abstract thinking need major efforts to understand new paradigms of design and development of information systems. Due to these difficulties, students face the subject with low motivation. The present work describes a series of teaching methodology changes carried out during the last three academic years, specially the implementation carried out during the 2017-18 year. The analysis of the results shows a high correlation between the students' participation and the success ratio of the subject by comparing the results obtained by students studying the active methodology in 2017-18 and the results for the academic year 2013-14.

AB  - User interactions with visualization systems have been shown to encode a great deal of information about the the users’ thinking processes, and analyzing their interaction trails can teach us more about the users, their approach, and how they arrived at insights. This deeper understanding is critical to improving their experience and outcomes, and there are tools available to visualize logs of interactions. It can be difficult to determine the structurally interesting parts of interaction data, though, like what set of button clicks constitutes an action that matters. In the case of visual analytics systems that use machine learning models, there is a convenient marker of when the user has significantly altered the state of the system via interaction: when the model is updated based on new information. We present a method for numerical analytic provenance using high-dimensional visualization to show and compare the trails of these sequences of model states of the system. We evaluate this approach with a prototype tool, ModelSpace, applied to two case studies on experimental data from model-steering visual analytics tools. ModelSpace reveals individual user’s progress, the relationships between their paths, and the characteristics of certain regions of the space of possible models.

AB  - Fault tolerance via diverse redundancy, with multiple "versions"' of a system in a redundant configuration, is an attractive defence against design faults. To reduce the probability of common failures, development and procurement practices pursue "diversity"' between the ways the different versions are developed. But difficult questions remain open about which practices are more effective to this aim. About these questions, probabilistic models have helped by exposing fallacies in "common sense" judgements. However, most make very restrictive assumptions. They model well scenarios in which diverse versions are developed in rigorous isolation from each other: A condition that many think desirable, but is unlikely in practice. We extend these models to cover nonindependent development processes for diverse versions. This gives us a rigorous way of framing claims and open questions about how best to pursue diversity, and about the effects--negative and positive--of commonalities between developments, from specification corrections to the choice of test cases. We obtain three theorems that, under specific scenarios, identify preferences between alternative ways of seeking diversity. We also discuss nonintuitive issues, including how expected system reliability may be improved by creating intentional "negative"' dependences between the developments of different versions.

AB  - Cloud Computing (CC) is a technological phenomenon that is becoming more and more important. Also Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can increase their competitiveness by taking advantage of CC. This new computing approach promises to provide many advantages, and many SMEs are encouraged to use it. However, CC is still in its early stage - for this reason we think that it is very important to study and assess its impact on SMEs' management processes. In this paper we propose a model for studying how Global Software Development can be facilitated using Cloud development environments, compared to a more traditional development environment. We use system dynamics to model and simulate how effective Cloud-based software development environments are for Global Software Development performed by a SMEs. Both studied environments assume a development process based on Scrum agile methodology. The proposed model could be used as a tool by the project managers to understand how Cloud Development Environments might facilitate Global Software Development.

AB  - Recent advances in wireless/mobile communication and body worn sensors, together with ambient intelligence and seamless integrated pervasive technology have paved the way for applications operating based on social signals, i.e., sensing and processing of group behavior, interpersonal relationships, or emotions. Thinking in large, it should be apparent that modeling social systems allowing to study crowd behavior emerging from individual entities' (agents') condition and/or characteristics is, in fact, a challenging task. To address the heterogeneity, analytical agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining popularity due to its capability of directly representing individual entities and their interactions, unfortunately, ABMs (in which each agent has unique behavior) are not very well suited for large populations, expressed by exponentially rising simulation time. To solve this problem, the questions (i) how does the parallel execution of such models scale with capabilities of both the machine (number of cores, cluster size, etc.) and agents (behavioral adaptation function, interaction extent, etc.) and (ii) what is, in comparison, the performance coefficient applying the approach of model execution on graphical processors (GPUs) with its different pipelining architecture, need answers. To this end, we have performed simulation runs with parameter variation on a real parallel and distributed hardware platform using Cilk as well as on a GPU employing OpenCL. Simulation efficiency for two realistic models with varying complexity on a scale of 107 agents has shown the usefulness of both approaches.

Therefore, generating models automatically is an attractive way of thinking. In well-structured application domains, such as graphical user interface (GUI), this method can be used successfully. This paper gives a state-of-the-art overview of GUI model generation methods. The paper analyzes the methods from the point of view of model-based testing of GUI applications, where generated GUI models are used for generating the tests.

AB  - Evaluating the performance of a computer system requires the use of representative workloads. Therefore it is customary to use recorded job traces in simulations to evaluate the performance of proposed parallel job schedulers. We argue that this practice retains unimportant attributes of the workload, at the expense of other more important attributes. Specifically, using traces in open-system simulations retains the exact timestamps at which jobs are submitted. But in a real system these times depend on how users react to the performance of previous jobs, and it is more important to preserve the logical structure of dependencies between jobs than the specific timestamps. Using dependency information extracted from traces, we show how a simulation can preserve these dependencies. To do so we also extract user behavior, in terms of sessions and think times between the termination of one batch of jobs and the submission of a subsequent batch.

AB  - Both interpretation and accuracy are very important for a predictive model in real applications, but most of previous works, no matter interpretable models or black-box models, cannot simultaneously achieve both of them, resulting in a tradeoff between model interpretation and model accuracy. To break this trade-off, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework, named IB-M, to align an $\underline{I}$nterpretable model and a $\underline{B}$lack-box $\underline{M}$odel for simultaneously optimizing model interpretation and model accuracy. Generally, we think most of samples that are well-clustered or away from the true decision boundary can be easily interpreted by an interpretable model. Removing those samples can help to learn a more accurate black-box model by focusing on the left samples around the true decision boundary. Inspired by this, we propose a data re-weighting based framework to align an interpretable model and a black-box model, letting them focus on the samples what they are good at, hence, achieving both interpretation and accuracy. We implement our IB-M framework for a real medical problem of ultrasound thyroid nodule diagnosis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework and algorithm can achieve a more interpretable and more accurate diagnosis than a single interpretable model and a single black-box model.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce 11–20 (Image Insight 2020), a multimedia analytics approach for analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. 11–20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand (“fast-forward”) the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality. User studies further confirm that II–20 is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have seen extensive studies on image recognition and classification, image segmentation, and related topics. However, recent studies show that DNNs are vulnerable in defending adversarial examples. The classification network can be deceived by adding a small amount of perturbation to clean samples. There are challenges when researchers want to design a general approach to defend against a wide variety of adversarial examples. To solve this problem, we introduce a defensive method to prevent adversarial examples from generating. Instead of designing a stronger classifier, we built a more robust classification system that can be viewed as a structural black box. After adding a buffer to the classification system, attackers can be efficiently deceived. The real evaluation results of the generated adversarial examples are often contrary to what the attacker thinks. Additionally, we do not assume a specific attack method premise. This incognizance to underlying attacks demonstrates the generalizability of the buffer to potential adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments indicate that the defense method greatly improves the security performance of DNNs.

AB  - How animals navigate in their cross-continental migration has puzzled scientists for centuries. To date, the mechanism behind this mysterious navigation remains unclear. In this paper, a hypothesis is developed and computer simulations have been performed to investigate long-distance animal navigation. Simulation results show that animals may be able to complete their long-distance navigation by observing a spatial angle included by the geomagnetic field line and a geographic direction, without necessarily knowing any prior landmark information. Our results not only match existing observation reports in detail on the long-distance migration routes of animals, but also are able to explain the conflicting evidence on the role of geomagnetic field in animal navigation. We think our results could help reveal the actual mechanism of animal navigation. This paper also provides a potential solution for global and local area navigation of mankind and machines assisted by artificial sensors.

AB  - This paper introduces a strategy to accelerate neighbor searching in agent-based simulations on GPU platforms. Because of their autonomous nature, agents can be processed by threads concurrently on GPU, and the overall simulation can be accelerated consequently. Each agent will simultaneously carry out a sense-think-act cycle in every time step. The neighbor searching is a crucial part in the sensing stage. Detecting and accessing neighbors is a memory intensive task and often becomes the major time consumer in an agent-based simulation. Our contribution, an enhanced neighbor sharing strategy, greatly speeds up this procedure when comparing with CPU implementations. The strategy is developed from a global-memory-only implementation, and then gradually improved by efficiently utilizing the much faster shared memory. In our case studies, speedups of 89.08 and 11.51 are obtained on an NVIDIA Tesla K20 GPU compared with the sequential implementation and OpenMP parallel implementation respectively on an Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU.

AB  - Ns-3 is a widely used as a the network simulator of choice by researchers. It contains many well tested and high quality models of network protocols. However, the application layer models of ns-3 are very simplistic, and do not capture all aspects of real life applications. As a result, there is often a huge gap between the results of real experiments and the corresponding simulations. This problem is particularly exacerbated for wireless simulations, where many networking phenomena like wireless channel contention crucially depend on the application traffic characteristics. One way to bridge the gap between experiments and simulations is to incorporate knowledge from network traces into simulations. To this end, our work builds a trace-based application layer simulator in ns-3. Given a network trace collected from a user, our TraceReplay application layer model automatically generates traffic that is faithful to the real application in the ns-3 simulator. TraceReplay infers and replays only application layer delays like user think times, lets the simulator control the lower layer phenomena. TraceReplay extracts application layer characteristics from a single trace, and replays this information across many users in simulation, by using suitable randomization. Our model is also generic enough to replay any application layer protocol. Validation of our simulation model shows that simulation results obtained using TraceReplay are significantly different from those using other models, and are closer to experimental observations.

AB  - Network and security is connected with each other. At present days thinking about communication without the network is impossible. Since the network is a public domain and anyone can use it, some corrupted people and hackers will try to gain profit by intruding others' sensitive information. The network intrusion can be done by some hackers or the network itself. For that reason ensuring security is more challenging than ever before. The proposed model detects the intrusion types currently in the network by using deep learning ANN and stack ensemble techniques. There is no space for compromise in security so it is strongly recommended to use an intrusion detection system that is more accurate and efficient. The reason for using a stacked ensemble is that even though a single deep learning model is strong enough to detect the intrusion, yet by using the stacked ensemble combines multiple deep learning models together to get a more efficient stronger intrusion detection mechanism.

AB  - Machine learning experts prefer to think of their input as a single, homogeneous, and consistent data set. However, when analyzing large volumes of data, the entire data set may not be manageable on a single server, but must be stored on a distributed file system instead. Moreover, with the pressing demand to deliver explainable models, the experts may no longer focus on the machine learning algorithms in isolation, but must take into account the distributed nature of the data stored, as well as the impact of any data pre-processing steps upstream in their data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we make the point that even basic transformations during data preparation can impact the model learned, and that this is exacerbated in a distributed setting. We then sketch our vision of end-to-end explainability of the model learned, taking the pre-processing into account. In particular, we point out the potentials of linking the contributions of research on data provenance with the efforts on explainability in machine learning. In doing so, we highlight pitfalls we may experience in a distributed system on the way to generating more holistic explanations for our machine learning models.

AB  - Psychologists note that humans regularly use categories to simplify and speed up the process of person perception [1]. The influence of categorical thinking on interpersonal expectations is commonly referred to as a stereotype. The ability to bootstrap the process of learning about a newly encountered, unknown person is critical for robots interacting in complex and dynamic social situations. This article contributes a novel cluster-based algorithm that allows a robot to create generalized models of its interactive partner. These generalized models, or stereotypes, act as a source of information for predicting the human's behavior and preferences. We show, in simulation and using real robots, that these stereotyped models of the partner can be used to bootstrap the robot's learning about the partner in spite of significant error. The results of this work have potential implications for social robotics, autonomous agents, and possibly psychology.

AB  - With the integration of distributed generation and the construction of cross-regional long-distance power grids, power systems become larger and more complex. They require faster computing speed and better scalability for power flow calculations to support unit dispatch. Based on the analysis of a variety of parallelization methods, this paper deploys the large-scale power flow calculation task on a cloud computing platform using resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). It optimizes a directed acyclic graph that is stored in the RDDs to solve the low performance problem of the MapReduce model. This paper constructs and simulates a power flow calculation on a large-scale power system based on standard IEEE test data. Experiments are conducted on Spark cluster which is deployed as a cloud computing platform. They show that the advantages of this method are not obvious at small scale, but the performance is superior to the stand-alone model and the MapReduce model for large-scale calculations. In addition, running time will be reduced when adding cluster nodes. Although not tested under practical conditions, this paper provides a new way of thinking about parallel power flow calculations in large-scale power systems.

AB  - Applications with adaptability are widely available on the edge devices with energy harvesting capabilities. For their runtime quality optimization, however, current approaches cannot tackle the variations of quality modeling and harvested energy simultaneously. Therefore, in this article, we are the first to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) method that optimizes the application execution quality of energy harvesting edge devices to mitigate the variations. First, we propose a baseline DRL formulation that novelly migrates the objective of quality maximization into a reward function and constructs a DRL quality agent. Second, we devise a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based selector that performs DRL quality agent selection based on the energy harvesting history. Third, we further propose two optimization methods to alleviate the nonnegligible overhead of DRL computations: 1) an improved thinking-while-moving concurrent DRL scheme to compromise the “state drifting” issue during the DRL decision process and 2) a variable interstate duration decision scheme that compromises the DVFS overhead incurred in each action taken. The experiments take an adaptive stereo matching application as a case study. The results show that the proposed DRL-based DVFS method on average achieves 17.9% runtime reduction and 22.05% quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

AB  - Air traffic management (ATM) services are migrating towards a global seamless concept. This requires new thinking not only on the necessary operational changes but also on the technological paradigms that determine our current service architectures. Driven by the availability of more and more bandwidth within wide area ground networks new technologies are emerging such as Cloud Computing. Beyond that, operational concepts of FAA's NEXTGEN and Europe's SESAR include dynamically moving the responsibility for airspace blocks from one facility to another, and ensuring continuity of operation by providing contingency operations. This contribution assesses the applicability of cloud computing in ATM, and the key differences to existing commercial applications. It presents the technical cloud computing elements necessary to achieve a truly global ATM system and addresses harmonization and interoperability aspects such as standardized working procedures and controller working positions equipment for air traffic controllers. Situational awareness is key for the decision making process of controllers and pilots in NEXTGEN. A key element different to commercial cloud applications is the necessity to communicate with aircraft and pilots as cloud participants via narrowband VHF radio communications, SATCOM, or other wireless communications technologies. Situational awareness of these participants is paramount which, in the current system, is automatically provided due to the broadcast nature of voice transmissions from controllers and pilots that can be received and heard by all listeners on a particular frequency nearly simultaneously (propagation delay of the radio signal not considered). To efficiently manage the access to this shared media and limit the access only to “relevant” participants, the concept of ATC sector within a geographical area, with boundaries (horizontal and vertical) aligned with traffic patterns exists today. This paper describes mechanisms that demonstrate how SATCOM, VHF, and various data link technologies can be integrated into a service cloud by virtualizing the sector concept and relaxing or completely removing the dependence on the underlying communications media. The advantage of this concept is that sectors can be dynamically defined based on operational ATM service needs without having to adhere to the coverage limitations of the underlying telecommunications service. The current ATM system is severely limited by the underlying telecommunications service models, most often by programmatic and contractual issues rather than their technical nature. We introduce the concept of a multi-point service within a virtual sector taking into consideration operational NEXTGEN issues and demands related to capacity, performance, and global coverage. Finally we introduce a new communications service model where selected parts of the infrastructure can be selectively and partially outsourced to certified service providers. This concept allows for smoother transition between the existing and next generation technologies, and reduces cost for the taxpayer while maintaining the safety of the flights.

AB  - When we perform a collaborative task with another human, we are able to tell, to a certain extent, how things are going and more precisely if things are going well or not. This knowledge allows us to adapt our behavior. Therefore, we think it is desirable to provide robots with means to measure in real-time the Quality of the Interaction with their human partners. To make this possible, we propose a model and a set of metrics targeting the evaluation of the QoI in collaborative tasks through the measure of the human engagement and the online task effectiveness. These model and metrics have been implemented and tested within the high-level controller of an entertainment robot deployed in a mall. The first results show significant differences in the computed QoI when in interaction with a fully compliant human, a confused human and a non-cooperative one.

AB  - The success of modern single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms is inspired by the development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these CNN-based methods require considerable computation and complexity, making it impossible for these methods to perform real-time calculations in edge devices. Thus, lightweight model design has become a development trend in the super-resolution field, including pruning, quantization, and other methods. The 1-bit quantization is an extreme lightweight method which can reduce the calculation amount of the model in an extreme manner and is friendly to hardware such as edge devices. Most existing binary quantization approaches lead to a large information loss during forward propagation, especially in detailed color information (e.g., edge, texture, and contrast). The loss of color information makes modern binary methods unsuitable for SISR tasks. We think the loss occurs because these methods typically utilize a uniform threshold to quantize the weights and activations. Thus, in this article, we thoroughly analyze the difference between normal classification tasks and SISR tasks, and present a binarization scheme based on local means. The proposed method can maintain more detailed information in feature maps using dynamic thresholds during quantization. Specifically, each value in the full precision activations has a corresponding threshold during the quantization process, and those thresholds are determined by the full precision values of the surroundings. In addition, a gradient approximator is introduced to adaptively optimize the gradient for updating binary weights. We then verify the effectiveness of our method for training binary networks on several SISR benchmarks including VDSR and SRResNet. Experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain binary networks for image super-resolution with better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values and visual quality.

AB  - New scheduling algorithms are first evaluated using simulation. In these simulations, the workload has a huge influence on the measured performance of the simulated system. Therefore, it is customary to use workload traces recorded previously from real systems. Such open-system simulations preserve all the jobs' properties. However, preserving the jobs' arrival times actually destroys the logic of the user's workflow, especially dependencies and think times between successive jobs. Furthermore, performance in such simulations is measured by the average wait time and slowdown, under the fixed load and throughput conditions dictated by the trace. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate the system's effect on throughput and productivity. As an alternative we propose semi-open trace based simulations that include dynamic user activity and internal feedback from the system to the users. In these simulations, like in a real system, users adjust their job-submittal behavior in response to system performance. As a result, the simulations produce different loads and throughputs for different scheduling algorithms or parametrizations. We implemented such a simulation for evaluating the schedulers of parallel job systems. We also developed a novel user-aware scheduler designed specifically to increase users' productivity. While conventional simulations cannot measure this scheduler's influence reliably, and would suggest it is useless, our simulation evaluates it realistically and shows its beneficial effect on the users' productivity and the system's throughput.

AB  - Customer co-creation is becoming increasingly popular among companies, and intensive communication with the customer is generally seen as a determinant of new product success. However, there is still limited insight into what interaction with customers really is. The most recent thinking argues for an understanding of value-in-context in order to co-create value with customers. The question, then, is how value-in-context can be captured and how this knowledge can be beneficial in the development process. In essence in order to capture this type of information a company needs to interact and communicate with their customers. However, this communication process has not been properly analyzed. In the present study we analyze customer collaboration based on four separate dimensions - frequency, direction, modality, and content - in order to understand the value of customer collaboration. The data comes from a survey of 207 managers with experience of new service and product development. The paper concludes that three of the four dimensions of customer collaboration have a significant positive effect on New Product Development performance and Market Share development.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges in intelligent robotics is to build robots that can learn to use language. To this end, we think that the practical long-term on-line concept/word learning algorithm for robots is a key issue to be addressed. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised on-line learning algorithm that uses Bayesian nonparametrics for categorizing multimodal sensory signals such as audio, visual, and haptic information for robots. The robot uses its physical body to grasp and observe an object from various viewpoints as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The most important property of the proposed framework is to learn multimodal concepts and the language model simultaneously. This mutual learning framework of concepts and language significantly improves both speech recognition and multimodal categorization performances. We conducted a long-term experiment where a human subject interacted with a real robot over 100 hours using 499 objects. Some interesting results of the experiment are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Systems Analysis modelling is considered foundational for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) students, with introductory and advanced units included in nearly all ICT and computer science degrees. Yet despite this, novice systems analysts (learners) find modelling and systems thinking quite difficult to learn and master. This makes the process of teaching the fundamentals frustrating and time intensive. This paper will discuss the foundational problems that learners face when learning Systems Analysis modelling. Through a systematic literature review, a framework will be proposed based on the key problems that novice learners experience. In this proposed framework, a sequence of activities has been developed to facilitate understanding of the requirements, solutions and incremental modelling. An example is provided illustrating how the framework could be used to incorporate visualization and gaming elements into a Systems Analysis classroom; therefore, improving motivation and learning. Through this work, a greater understanding of the approach to teaching modelling within the computer science classroom will be provided, as well as a framework to guide future teaching activities.

AB  - Due to the variety of devices and operating scenarios in an integrated energy system (IES), the optimal dispatch of an IES is usually complicated. An optimal dispatch method for an IES is proposed by defining the scheduling value for each device which can be different under various scenarios. First, thinking over the private and public attributes of each operating equipment, the evaluation system is established with the actual scenarios of economic, environmental and energy-savings being considered. Secondly, the economic, environmental and energy-saving benefits of each operating equipment are quantified by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Therefore, the scheduling value of the device is comprehensively assessed according to the specific scenario. Finally, decomposing the output of the device into direct available energy and indirect available energy, an optimal model is built with the maximum general production benefits as the objective, and is solved by MATLAB and CPLEX. The simulation results show that the evaluation system can reflect multiple values of devices. The proposed model can unify the modeling of optimal dispatch for different scenarios in the IES and can improve dispatch efficiency, while ensuring the accuracy of the results with high computation efficiency.

AB  - We present a framework that incorporates the principle of bounded rationality into a pursuit-evasion game between two aerial vehicles in a stochastic wind field. We initially formulate the problem as a continuous zero-sum stochastic game under perfect rationality. We then discretize the game via the Markov Chain Approximation Method. Leveraging the cognitive hierarchy theory (“level-k thinking”) we relax the perfect rationality assumption and compute the solution of the ensuing discrete game, while taking into consideration the rationality level of each agent. We also present an online algorithm to infer the rationality of the opponent, which enables the agents to deploy appropriate countermeasures. Finally, we verify the efficacy of this framework through simulations.

AB  - Analyzing classification model performance is a crucial task for machine learning practitioners. While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze model calibration.

AB  - Recent research characterizes two types of program errors. The repeatable class, called Bohrbugs, always cause the same error with the same inputs. Prior thinking and reliability growth models were based on Bohrbugs, (Bbugs). Another class of errors called Mandelbugs, (Mbugs), are difficult to reproduce even with the same inputs, [1], [2]. Mbugs may be an interaction of inputs with computer storage, where computer storage represents the past history of inputs to the computer system [3]. A small fraction of Mbugs which increase with time, aging-related Mbugs, are ignored in the model. This paper formulates a software reliability growth model for predicting operational reliability of the software as development progresses. Based on prior experience, constant and exponentially decreasing error removal models are assumed. The inputs to the model are error removal data for both Bbugs and Mbugs, recorded during development testing and mean time to failure data from simulated operational tests. Simplified values for the model parameters are developed based on moment estimates. More sophisticated estimates using least squares and maximum likelihood techniques are discussed. The potential for improving the accuracy of reliability estimates by using models that incorporate both Bbugs and Mbugs is discussed with respect to two examples.

AB  - In this paper, we study an approach for discovering brand associations by leveraging large-scale online photo collections contributed by the general public. Brand Associations, one of central concepts in marketing, describe customers' top-of-mind attitudes or feelings toward a brand. (e.g. what comes to mind when you think of Burberry?) Traditionally, brand associations are measured by analyzing the text data from consumers' responses to the survey or their online conversation logs. In this paper, we go beyond textual media and take advantage of large-scale photos shared on the Web. More specifically, we jointly achieve the following two fundamental tasks in a mutually-rewarding way: (i) detecting exemplar images as key visual concepts associated with brands, and (ii) localizing the regions of brand in images. For experiments we collect about five millions of images of 48 brands crawled from five popular online photo sharing sites. We then demonstrate that our approach can discover complementary views on the brand associations that are hardly obtained from text data. We also quantitatively show the superior performance of our algorithm for the two tasks over other candidate methods.

AB  - Image inpainting is an important task in computer vision. As admirable methods are presented, the inpainted image is getting closer to reality. However, the result is still not good enough in the reconstructed texture and structure based on human vision. Although recent advances in computer hardware have enabled the development of larger and more complex models, there is still a need for lightweight models that can be used by individuals and small-sized institutions. Therefore, we propose a lightweight model that combines a specialized transformer with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, we have noticed most researchers only consider three primary colors (RGB) in inpainted images, but we think this is not enough. So we propose a new loss function to intensify color details. Extensive experiments on commonly seen datasets (Places2 and CelebA) validate the efficacy of our proposed model compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Due to the popularity of the Computer science field many students study programming. With large numbers of student enrollments in undergraduate courses, assessing programming submissions is becoming an increasingly tedious task that requires high cognitive load, and considerable amount of time and effort. Programming assignments usually contain algorithmic implementations written in specific programming languages to assess students' logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Evaluators use either a test case-driven or source code analysis approach when evaluating programming assignments. Given that many marking rubrics and evaluation criteria provide partial marks for programs that are not syntactically correct, evaluators are required to analyze the source code during evaluations. This extra step adds additional burden on evaluators that consumes more time and effort. Hence, this research work attempts to study existing automatic source code analysis mechanisms, specifically, use of deep learning approaches in the domain of automatic assessments. Such knowledge may lead to creating novel automated marking models using past student data and apply deep learning techniques to implement automatic assessments of programming assignments irrespective of the computer language or the algorithm implemented.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AZM) is a deadly neurology syndrome caused by memory loss. It is the most common kind of dementia. It is a syndrome that begins with modest memory loss and gradually deteriorates your thinking abilities, occasions, and ability to execute day-to-day routine tasks. It affects the areas of the brain that govern cognition, memory, and language. It has the potential to have a significant influence on a person's ability to carry out everyday responsibility. Because no drug or cure has yet been discovered, it is critical to forecast it at an early stage. The prediction of Alzheimer's disease is done manually by evaluating MRI scans; nevertheless, the risks of human mistake are quite high with this method. The purpose of this research is to improve prediction accuracy in order to detect AZM at an early stage and prevent the patient from progressing to a severe state of the disease. In this research, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Softmax classifier (i.e., CNN+Softmax) has been used to identify and categories the AZM MRI into four distinct classes, namely mild demented (MD), moderate demented (MOD), non-demented (ND), very mild demented (VMD). The proposed CNN+Softmax model is then compared by replacing the dense layer of CNN to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, i.e., CNN+SVM and the work is calculated on the various grids which includes accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. On test data, the presented approach surmounted the CNN+SVM model with a classification accuracy of 98.59 percent.

AB  - An interactive computer-based learning tool with multiple sessions is proposed in this paper, which teaches students to think and helps them recognize the merits and limitations of simulation tools so as to improve their practical abilities in electrical circuit simulation based on the case of a power converter with progressive problems. The common problem of fast simulation and differential equation solver convergence are discussed in detail for the simulation of nonlinear power electronic circuits. Another special ratio for ripple restriction is proposed, taking practical work into consideration. Some design and simulation tradeoffs for corresponding problems are also presented. Such a learning tool can improve students' programming skills and inspire their interest in practical work as well. The practical tests-carried out at the Aichi Institute of Technology, Toyota, Japan, and Southeast University, Nanjing, China- validate the effectiveness of the learning tool.

AB  - In order to keep trace of information and grow up, the infant brain has to resolve the problem about where old information is located and how to index new ones. We propose that the immature prefrontal cortex (PFC) uses its primary functionality of detecting hierarchical patterns in temporal signals as a second feature to organize the spatial ordering of the cortical networks in the developing brain itself. Our hypothesis is that the PFC detects the hierarchical structure in temporal sequences in the shape of ordinal patterns and uses them to index information hierarchically in different parts of the brain. Henceforth, we propose that this mechanism for detecting ordinal patterns participates also in the hierarchical organization of the brain during development; i.e., the bootstrapping of the connectome. By doing so, it gives the tools to the language-ready brain for manipulating abstract knowledge and for planning temporally ordered information; i.e., the emergence of causality and symbolic thinking. In this position paper, we will review several neural models from the literature that support serial ordering and propose an original one. We will confront then our ideas with evidence from developmental, behavioral, and brain results.

AB  - Manufacturing through the use of cloud computing has been further extended using cloud manufacturing technology. According to the literature, the benefits of this approach include transparency, cost-efficiency, sharing of resources and the scalability of production. A multi-agent system-informed ontology used in manufacturing environments facilitates knowledge storage, inference and retrieval especially for the case of distributed resources. Based on service-oriented thinking, a cloud manufacturing OWL-S ontology model is proposed. Ontology mapping and an inference engine will be used to complete service request, publishing and binding processes. A new cloud-oriented manufacturing service OWL-S ontology would provide an extension to the Web framework, which introduces a semantic description of manufacturing services. This is for the cloud to build upon theoretical foundations and comply with standards. Manufacturing services are built in with a cloud-based negotiation mechanism using agent division, cooperation, competition and negotiation to achieve dynamic cloud manufacturing services' aggregation and running. ANALYSIS is a complex, non-linear, large cloud dynamic system for manufacturing. It is a cloud-based agent model represented in IDEF0 view, and functions on the basis of analysis of the mode of operation. Cloud services are adaptable to clients' needs, and these may include various stages of a product lifestyle, including product design, manufacturing, testing and management.

AB  - Dynamic modeling offers many benefits to understand the dynamics of complex systems. Hybrid modeling attempts to bring together the complementary benefits of differing dynamic modeling approaches, such as System Dynamics and Agent-based modeling, to bear on a single research question. We present here, by means of an example, a hybrid modeling technique that allows different modules to be specified separately from their implementation. This enables each module to be designed and constructed on an ad-hoc basis. This approach results in 3 benefits: it facilitates incremental development, a key focus in agile software design; it enhances the ability to test and learn from the behavior of a dynamic model; and it can help with clearer thinking about model structure, especially for those of a hybrid nature.

AB  - Personality of software developers professionals has been a continuous element of interest in academic research. Researchers have applied different models of personality analysis in various software engineering areas to identify improvement points, to promote job satisfaction and to better organize teams. This paper aims to conduct a study, by means of an experience report, to evaluate the MBTI personality model (Myers-Briggs Type Indication) applied to software developers and to understand how human personality influences professionals' work. The experience was applied in one private university to 6 developers to measure quality of developed software by means of Object Oriented Software Metrics. Each software analyzed was developed by a single developer. Evidence was found that developers with MBTI type “INTJ” (Introvert, iNtuitive, Thinking, Judging), presented lower levels of depth of inheritance tree (DIT) and “slightly” smaller methods (LOC). As a result, it is clear that further research on the relationship between personality and object-oriented software metrics is needed.

AB  - At the tipping of a paradigm shift in the way energy is produced, transmitted and delivered, the research efforts have not been paralleled by the curricular development. With rapid pace of changes in the field of Smart Grid (SG), the traditional research and educational efforts have been a major domain for electrical engineers. As a mode of discovery and education, interdisciplinarity facilitates broadened perspectives, ability to synthesize, analyze, integrate, and apply knowledge, and out-of-the-box thinking. The major contributions of this paper are discussion of requirements of the educational efforts in SG with special emphasis on multidisciplinarity, survey of the related work, which is the first in the literature to the best of our knowledge, and a discussion of the content for such an effort. A mixed team of power engineers and computer scientists are developing a layered curriculum starting from the introductory material from a variety of SG topics. A distinguishing advantage is the availability of many software tools and the state-of-the-art testbed as a result of years of research.

AB  - The first concern when we think about adopting cloud computing is security. Even if, cloud computing seems to be remarkably cheap, the security part might transform the "buzz world" in a terribly expensive technology. The goal of this paper is to present a different perspective of delivering security as a service thru a new defined concept, trust engines. This concept, introduced in this paper, relies on trust management. A trust management system can be achieved in cloud computing by implementing multiple trust models that define what a user can do and what type of protection he has. By identifying the static and dynamic trust models, the cloud provider and the cloud user can have a proper control of the cloud security. A trust model engine could create both static and dynamic rules that will establish a classified profile for all the cloud users.

AB  - In an educational institution, various students criteria contributed to the main reason the student is nominated as a model student. This includes cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of academic courses taken, co-curriculum involvement, soft skills, hard work, leadership, attitude, time management, attendance, attire, and technical skill in order to make the selection decision. The distinctive student is identified firstly based on their overall score. The problem arises when one needs to evaluate all these different criteria in order to select or nominated a model student. It is a tedious task and time consuming for examiner or reviewer to analyze students individually in order to select a student that showed desirable performance. In addition, as a human has its limitation, there is a high degree of error in judgment in decision making. With the aim of bridging this gap, fuzzy logic is applied to imitate human analytic thinking or the ability to make a decision in the model student selection process. Thus, the system is able to assist examiner or evaluator in the decision-making process of determining the model student with minimal time and error. Furthermore, the user could dynamically change the criteria based on the traits that have been set by the system. Fuzzy logic is chosen as it is a powerful mathematical tool involving ambiguous and incomplete information supported by the experience and judgment of examiner or reviewer while combining this cognitive ability in order to reach a verdict. Therefore, the outputs from the experiment conducted shows that the system provides robust output and information to the user regarding student's aptitude and ultimately aim to effectively predict human judgment.

AB  - The context of this work is that of designing an IMS-LD model for collaboration space of a Learning Management System (LMS). Our work is specifically in the field or seeking to promote, by means of information technology from a distance. Our approach is to first think about the conditions for creating a real LMS between learners, and designing the IT environment that supports this LMS. In this paper, we try to adapt the IMS-LD model with a collaboration model for Learning Management System based on the social constructivism. This adaptation will go through three stages. Firstly, the development of an LMS model. Secondly, the study of correspondence between the developed model and IMS-LD model and their transformation to IMS-LD model.

AB  - Visual analytics (VA) tools support data exploration by helping analysts quickly and iteratively generate views of data which reveal interesting patterns. However, these tools seldom enable explicit checks of the resulting interpretations of data—e.g., whether patterns can be accounted for by a model that implies a particular structure in the relationships between variables. We present EVM, a data exploration tool that enables users to express and check provisional interpretations of data in the form of statistical models. EVM integrates support for visualization-based model checks by rendering distributions of model predictions alongside user-generated views of data. In a user study with data scientists practicing in the private and public sector, we evaluate how model checks influence analysts' thinking during data exploration. Our analysis characterizes how participants use model checks to scrutinize expectations about data generating process and surfaces further opportunities to scaffold model exploration in VA tools.

AB  - Mobile devices are commonly found with learners in class, lecturers find it difficult to keep learners focused on the assigned learning activity as learners pretend to be attentive while multitasking. Some educators perceive the mobile devices as learning obstructers and think they should be abolished, however, research has revealed that if the devices are managed well, they can arouse the learner's curiosity to continue learning. The challenge is left to educators to figure out how to manage the learner's attention while using the mobile devices in class without compromising the quality of learning. With online learning tasks, observations and system login statistics as research instruments, this study investigated some of the factors that affected learners' attention and how they influence learner's engagement and learning outcomes in a mobile learning classroom. Using second year undergraduate learners as participants, each learner was allowed to connect and retrieve information from a content management system in order to access instructions and learning content. The learners interacted via chats, discussion forums and submit assignments online. Login data was captured and the lecturer observed learner behaviour. The results revealed that assignment feedback deadlines, instructions and content format, Learner Response time; and Learners' Self-Initiative, or drive played significant role in influencing learner's attention.

AB  - The AERPAW project is an ambitious project, funded by the PAWR program of the US NSF, to create a remote accessible research platform for a research facility with some distinct features that makes its usage model unique, and non-obvious to many researchers desirous of making use of this platform. AERPAW is primarily a physical resource (not a computing or cyber-resource) - the RF enviroment, and the airspace. Experimenters can explore them through radio transceivers and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, both under the Experimenter’s programmatic control. Since the entire workflow of the user is through the mediation of virtual computing environments, users often tend to think of AERPAW as a computing resource, and find some of the experiment workflow counter-intuitive. In this paper, we articulate the challenges and considerations of designing an experiment workflow that balances the need for guaranteeing safe testbed operation, and providing flexible programmatic access to this unique resource.

AB  - Cyber Bullying is one of the most recent evils of social media. With a boom in the usage of social media, the freedom of expression is being exploited. Statistics show that overall 36.5 percent people think they have been cyberbullied in their lifetime. These numbers are more than double of what they were in 2007, and there is an increase from 2018–19, suggesting we are heading in the wrong direction. Solutions to curtail this issue to a certain extent have already been deployed in the market. However, they possess limitations of usage, or simply do not use efficient algorithms. This paper aims at identifying cyberbullying at is origin, meaning when it is being drafted in real-time. Identifying traces of cyberbullying before the content is uploaded on the internet can help reduce circulation of hurtful messages. Using Machine Learning with the support of Natural Language Processing(NLP, results in better performance of cyberbullying detection.

AB  - Unlike traditional animation techniques, which attempt to copy human movement, ‘cognitive’ animation solutions mimic the brain's approach to problem solving, i.e., a logical (intelligent) thinking structure. This procedural animation solution uses bio-inspired insights (modelling nature and the workings of the brain) to unveil a new generation of intelligent agents. As with any promising new approach, it raises hopes and questions; an extremely challenging task that offers a revolutionary solution, not just in animation but to a variety of fields, from intelligent robotics and physics to nanotechnology and electrical engineering. Questions, such as, how does the brain coordinate muscle signals? How does the brain know which body parts to move? With all these activities happening in our brain, we examine how our brain ‘sees’ our body and how it can affect our movements. Through this understanding of the human brain and the cognitive process, models can be created to mimic our abilities, such as, synthesizing actions that solve and react to unforeseen problems in a humanistic manner. We present an introduction to the concept of cognitive skills, as an aid in finding and designing a viable solution. This helps us address principal challenges, such as: How do characters perceive the outside world (input) and how does this input influence their motions? What is required to emulate adaptive learning skills as seen in higher life-forms (e.g., a child's cognitive learning process)? How can we control and ‘direct’ these autonomous procedural character motions? Finally, drawing from experimentation and literature, we suggest hypotheses for solving these questions and more. In summary, this article analyses the biological and cognitive workings of the human mind, specifically motor skills. Reviewing cognitive psychology research related to movement in an attempt to produce more attentive behavioural characteristics. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of cognitive methods for creating virtual character animations, limitations and future applications.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) clouds, software architects face new challenges in software architecture design, e.g. efficiently integrating those chosen web services into clouds. In this respect, early quality evaluation of the designed SaaS cloud application is crucial to mitigate the risk of later architectural changes due to a violation of quality requirements (such as response time, network throughput and scalability). Architects need to navigate in a rich set of offered services, a variability of the SaaS cloud environments, which makes it difficult to predict the general approach without time-consuming implementation of application prototypes (using GraphQL, Representational State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) approaches). In this paper, we present an abstract application model designed to select the details with a high level of scalability and efficient interactions between service components. This model is reusable and provides new way of thinking about cloud architecture.

AB  - Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are successful in learning hidden topics and has been widely applied in text mining. There are many recently developed augmented topic modeling methods to utilize metadata information. However, the effect of topic models is still not comparable to humans. We think one key point is that humans have background knowledge, which is essential for topic understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a knowledge base enhanced topic model in this paper. We take knowledge bases as good presentations of human knowledge, with huge collections of entities and their relations. We assume that documents with related entities tend to have similar topic distributions. Based on this assumption, we compute document similarity information via the linked entities and then use it as a constraint for LDA. More specifically, we embed entities in a low-dimensional space via DeepWalk and use Entity Movers Distance to efficiently and effectively measure the similarities between documents. The results of experiments over two real-world datasets show that our method boosts the LDA model on the document classification while no supervision information is needed.

AB  - Small, medium, and big organizations get several advantages from cloud computing, but it also presents obstacles. Whether a firm is in the financial, technology, or engineering sector, a cloud component might be beneficial. Though there are numerous obstacles associated with cloud computing, experts think that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The issues will be addressed when more research in the field of cloud computing is conducted. Cloud services are provided by a number of significant companies, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, among others. Among them, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the fine cloud service providers that comprises several features, including the AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) which is one of the widely used by many organizations. Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud Web service delivers highly adjustable processing capacity throughout the cloud, allowing developers to construct applications with incredible scalability. Using EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) by using the proposed deployment method can be more effort saver for any IT development and deployment team for any organization. There should be an easy deployment method that auto-configures EC2 Instance. The aim of this research paper is to showcase the current deployment and service models provided by Amazon Web Services EC2 and present the proposed solution in order to the existing scenario. Furthermore, its advantages are also present so that it becomes easier to select the most appropriate one for deployment and research development.

AB  - This paper presents an energy-based probabilistic model that handles nonnegative data in consideration of both linear and logarithmic scales. In audio applications, magnitude of time-frequency representation, including spectrogram, is regarded as one of the most important features. Such magnitude-based features have been extensively utilized in learning-based audio processing. Since a logarithmic scale is important in terms of auditory perception, the features are usually computed with a logarithmic function. That is, a logarithmic function is applied within the computation of features so that a learning machine does not have to explicitly model the logarithmic scale. We think in a different way and propose a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that simultaneously models linear- and log-magnitude spectra. RBM is a stochastic neural network that can discover data representations without supervision. To manage both linear and logarithmic scales, we define an energy function based on both scales. This energy function results in a conditional distribution (of the observable data, given hidden units) that is written as the gamma distribution, and hence the proposed RBM is termed gamma-Bernoulli RBM. The proposed gamma-Bernoulli RBM was compared to the ordinary Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM by speech representation experiments. Both objective and subjective evaluations illustrated the advantage of the proposed model.

AB  - The analysis of personality behavior has become important in many applications such as educational hypermedia systems, psychotherapy, and business recommendation systems. With the development of social media platforms (SMPs), people can express their feelings and opinions through their personal posts, comments and/or tweets. This study aims to analyze texts on SMPs to identify users' personalities according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model. It also sought to enhance prediction accuracy and compare the findings with various deep learning techniques and previous literature. This study analyzes personality through a dataset that includes 8667 participants. Two deep learning techniques are implemented namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike earlier literature, this research helps improve the prediction accuracy of users' personalities by building a multi-layer deep learning network and integrating the random search optimization approach. The results suggest that LSTM with the application of random search optimization outperformed previous findings. The average prediction accuracy of the four dimensions namely, Introversion-Extroversion (IE), Feeling-Thinking (FT), Intuition-Sensing (NS), and Judging-Perceiving (JP) is 85.02%.

AB  - The Department of Defense is adopting model-based systems engineering in which models will replace the extensive amounts of documentation generated in developing a new system. This research examines how this shift from textual description of requirements to a model-based description will effect the requirements engineering process. Specifically, we ask whether engineers will be able to extract the same understanding of the system requirements from the models as they can from the traditional textual requirements specifications. This paper describes the theory and related work on the understandability of models and the performance of cognitive tasks such as requirements engineering. Our research into model representation is part of a larger effort on a theory of model relativity postulating that models affect how we think about the system of interest. In this paper, we present our exploratory research studies, discuss our research protocol, describe the research plan, and present the current status of our study.

AB  - With an aging population that continues to grow, dementia is a major global health concern. It is a syndrome in which there is a deterioration in memory, thinking, be-havior and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Depression and aggressive behavior are the most upsetting and challenging symptoms of dementia. Automatic recognition of these behaviors would not only be useful to alert family members and caregivers, but also helpful in planning and managing daily activities of people with dementia (PwD). In this work, we propose a vision-based approach that unifies transfer learning and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the effective recognition of behavioral symptoms. We also compare the performance of state-of-the-art CNN features with the hand-crafted HOG-feature, as well as their combination using a basic linear SVM. The proposed method is evaluated on a newly created dataset, which is based on the dementia storyline in ITVs Emmerdale episodes. The Alzheimer's Society has described it as a "realistic portrayal"1 of the condition to raise awareness of the issues surrounding dementia.

AB  - The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models (LLMs) for artificial general intelligence (AGI). These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress of VLMs in RS (see Figure 1), and to inspire further research in this exciting and promising field.

AB  - Big Data, Cloud Computing are, beyond a technical revolution, a mental revolution: they change the basic assumptions of computing, as such the mental habits that are proper of classical computing teaching. For this reason, we think it is essential to help students to change their mental habits as early as possible, become familiar with at least the basic notions of distributed storage, cloud computing. In this paper we introduce the Little Big Data system, that has been developed with an ambitious task in mind: teach cloud computing basics to K-12 kids, helping them to be part of this revolution. We report on the creation of the system, the challenges, also the impact on higher K-18 education. The results, tested in the field with a wide variety of kids, children, have been extremely successful, thanks also to advanced educational techniques like gamification, have also provided valuable insights for the general problem of education of big data computing.

AB  - Accessibility is an important aspect of websites generally and public websites particularly. Many ways could be proposed to enhance accessibility, however the impact of selected actions is hard to predict due to diversification and contradiction, in addition to the existence of the time factor. A System Dynamics simulation model including factors affecting the accessibility of Norwegian municipal websites was encapsulated in an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE). As the model promised to be able to change how users think and take decisions, this ILE was tested by users in an experiment. We have conducted α, β, and γ change analysis on the results of this experiment. Results showed that the ILE was successful in changing 50% of its users' understanding and perceptions about the system's causal relationships and policy options, and helping 30% redefining the standards they use to assess or evaluate these relationships and policy options.

AB  - Emotion analysis is currently an attractive research topic in data mining and natural language processing. Along with the development of technology, people are also gradually evolving to post their emotional thinking on social media. Emotional information is useful for various aspects of business such as advertisement. Automatically classifying user emotions therefore becomes very important. In this paper we firstly formulate this problem under Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. Actually language to express emotions is very diverse that make deep learning techniques such as CNN are ineffective in feature learning when the training data is not large enough. To solve this problem, we propose to use predefined grammatical patterns, which contain potential emotional information, to extract external features and integrate them into the CNN model. Our experiment are performed on two datasets, the ISEAR11http://affective-sciences.org/home/research/materials-and-onlineresearch/research-material/ (International Survey On Emotion Antecedents And Reactions) dataset and the Vietnamese emotion dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is very effective in comparison with previous studies.

AB  - Reservoir Computing is a paradigm of recurrent neural network (RNN) models, attractive because of its ease of training and new neuromorphic optoelectronic implementations. Applied with success to time series prediction and speech recognition, few works have so far studied the behavior of these networks on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Therefore, we decided to explore the ability of Echo State Network-based Reservoir Computing (ESN) models with additional embedding layers to classify text documents of the Reuters C50 data set based on authorship. We explored various learned representations such as word and character embedding and deep feature extractors. Our experiments demonstrate that ESN models can achieve state-of-the-art results on this task and are competitive with common models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). Moreover, we show that these models compute documents as data streams and could then be able to handle other tasks such as event detection and text segmentation. The best performance is obtained by an ESN with a large reservoir of 1,500 neurons based on word vectors. We think that these results demonstrate the possibility of processing massive quantities of textual data in the future using Reservoir Computing-based systems.

AB  - The high development of emerging computing paradigms, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing, and Social Computing, has brought us a big change from all walks of our work, life, learning and entertainment. Especially, with the high accessibility of social networking services along with the increasingly pervasive use of portable wireless mobile computing devices, more and more populations have been engaged into this kind of integration of real physical world and cyber digital space, which can be called the hyper world. To help people live better in the highly developed information society, the so-called cyber-individual (Cyber-I), which is far beyond a user model or a software agent to assist a user, has been proposed to provide the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of the individual's experience, behavior, and thinking as well as his or her birth, growth, and death. In this study, we concentrate on the personal data analytics to facilitate the cyber individual modeling. Organic Stream is introduced to systematically organize and refine the personal stream data, which can help improve the data processing and management in the CI-Spine tier and CI-Pivot tier of Cyber-I. The DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model is employed to better utilize the collective intelligence from a group of users, which can help improve the CI-Mind tier to make Cyber-I to become more robust. Based on these, we discuss the functional modules for the facilitation of cyber individual modeling. Finally, a scenario is given, and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the valuable outcomes from the personal analysis can be utilized to enrich the Cyber-I, and provide users with more suitable services.

AB  - The migration of traditional deployment to clouds has driven the need for a more robust security model, the Zero-Trust model. The application of zero-trust principles addresses known security issues such as lateral movement attacks but adds extra identity management complexity. In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead. We believe this combination not only improves the security of SPIFFE deployments but also leverages SPIFFE to facilitate the integration between confidential computing components and native applications.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a accelerating brain disease that wreaks havoc on memory and cognition, as well as the ability to perform even the most basic tasks. Dementia, which gradually damages brain cells, is the primary cause of AD. People with this disease lose their ability to think, read, and do a variety of other things. A machine learning system can help to alleviate this problem by predicting the disease. The primary goal is to detect dementia in a wide range of patients. The classification of speech signal into various categories such as audio, non- audio is an very significant front-end problem in AD prediction. There are many features have been presented for AD prediction. Unfortunately, these characteristics are not mutually exclusive, and combining them has no effect on AD prediction performance. By removing these redundant and irrelevant features, Feature Selection (FS) provides a simple yet effective solution to this problem. Removing irrelevant data improves learning accuracy, decreases computation time, and allows for a more thorough understanding of the learning model or data. The proposed model in this paper is a hybrid machine learning model in which we used an FS approach based on Mutual Information (MI). MLP is used for classification and MFCC is used to extract all of the features from the ADReSSo dataset. In terms of accuracy, our experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms existing classifiers.

In this paper we will show our didactic experiences in the Software Engineering Processes course. We developed a sequence of learning activities and their application (extracted from real requirements of clients and users) in different contexts such as environmental, medical and social, which results in higher levels of learning, interdisciplinary exercises and practices close to what students will face in their professional lives.

AB  - Smart phones and cloud computing were introduced to automation industry as components of connected enterprise integration systems. The established protocols and interfacing done in that area, beside the rapid growth of the hardware specification of those devices, was behind the motivation to think of smart phones as programming and simulation devices. This paper proposes a conceptual design of a system integration work structure based on smart phones and cloud computing. The conceptual design is supported by prototype of an Android application for Siemens SCL programming and simulation. The proposal assumes a private cloud with a SAAS/PAAS/IAAS cloud model owned by an Automation solutions vendor (provider) whereas the handheld portable computing devices (e.g. smart phones) performs typical POUs (Project organization units) configuration and/or programming of preconfigured device (controller) and uploading the generated and tested-by means of simulation-code as (.prj files) or .txt files to the cloud. As part of the design, the paper will present a smart phone based automation application which will be capable of parsing the IEC 61131-3 SCL PLC programming language code, interpreting and checking validity by means of a high level simulator (Java based), generating a .txt file, this will assume a private cloud model and a coding (Engineering) management application on the server side.

AB  - Cloud computing is a vital paradigm which has become a top priority in companies around the world. Small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are thinking about how to adopt Cloud computing with high hopes of improving efficiency, using the latest technologies, increasing agility, avoiding the headache of acquiring hardware and software in CDC and, finally, saving money by minimizing the upfront cost. However, there are currently no accurate feasibility or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) studies to encourage them to go for the Cloud approach and stop modernizing CDC. Since Cloud cost is one of the key topics nowadays, a one-year project was conducted to modernize and innovate a Classical Data Center (CDC) owned by a Jordanian information technology company and track the associated expenses to determine whether modernization of a CDC or adoption of Cloud computing instances is more cost-effective. To achieve clear insights, this study presented the cost difference between modernization of CDC and Oracle Cloud adoption. The results of this research study revealed that Cloud Computing is highly cost effective when TCO is calculated. Moreover, this study could be useful and applicable for information technology enterprises and banking domains.

AB  - The rise of cybercrime is a daily challenge for individuals, organizations, and governments, especially when resources are scarce and cyberattacks are becoming more complex. These organizations often find it difficult to identify and stop such attacks, but they must investigate them to reduce the damage. This study aims to create a detailed model to help with the investigations of cybercrimes. To build this model, we reviewed existing research on cybercrime and investigative methods, and we used analytical techniques, studies, and logical reasoning. After examining different stages of investigations and the information needed, we created a model and put it to the test by investigating an insider attack. We think that this model could be the foundation for practical guidelines to investigate security breaches in organizations with either limited or ample resources.

AB  - The task of automatically generating image captions draws a lot of attention in the past few years because it shows great potential in a wide range of application scenarios. The encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanism has been extensively applied to solve this task. However, most researches apply attention mechanism only to pay attention to image features but neglect the relations between image features which we think play an important role in scene understanding. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism named “attention to Time-Dependent Pre-Attention” (TDPA-attention) and the TDPA-attention is combined with a hierarchical LSTM decoder to compose our captioning model (TDPA-model). Within our TDPA-attention, at every time step, every image feature pays attention to all image features according to a semantic context and the attended feature is treated as an aggregated feature that contains relations between this image feature and all image features. All these aggregated features form a new feature set that the hierarchical LSTM decoder attends to. We evaluate our model on public image caption dataset Microsoft COCO and achieve state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics.

AB  - Test and evaluation may be viewed as a technology enabler for the successful deployment of unmanned vehicles and robots in all their envisioned applications. It is however a challenging endeavor, considering that roboticists and developers are not used to thinking of comprehensive test and evaluation as an integral part of robot development. Moreover, the community who has conducted test and evaluation up to this date does not possess the tools to cope with the growing complexity of unmanned and autonomous systems. This paper proposes an approach to one of the hardest problems in testing and evaluation of robots: mission-based test planning. This approach relies on constructive simulation tools and on evolutionary computing techniques for searching in high dimensional spaces of possible test scenarios. The goal of the test planner is to generate a set of tests that make highly efficient use of resources to unveil weaknesses of the system under test in a context of a specific mission.

AB  - With the introduction of low-cost and widely accessible sensors such as cellphones, drones, satellites, voice recorders, and bio-logging equipment, the amount of information collected about animals has expanded. Meanwhile, modern data processing systems prohibit them from collecting, digesting, and condensing data into usable information. We think that machine learning, especially deep learning algorithms, will be able to tackle this analytical difficulty by enhancing our understanding, monitoring capacities, and animal welfare. By merging machine learning with ecological processes, it may be feasible to expand the inputs to population and behavior models, resulting in integrated hybrid modeling tools where machine learning models give data-supported insights and ecological models act as constraints. Animal ecologists may basically profit from the quantity of data created by contemporary sensor technologies by integrating cutting-edge machine learning methods with ecological domain expertise. This will enable them to assess population abundances more precisely, research animal behavior, and reduce human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The main aspect powering GNNs is the multi-layer network architecture to learn the nonlinear representation for graph learning task. The core operation in GNNs is the message propagation in which each node updates its information by aggregating the information from its neighbors. Existing GNNs usually adopt either linear neighborhood aggregation (e.g. mean, sum) or max aggregator in their message propagation. 1) For linear aggregators, the whole nonlinearity and network's capacity of GNNs are generally limited because deeper GNNs usually suffer from the over-smoothing issue due to their inherent information propagation mechanism. Also, linear aggregators are usually vulnerable to the spatial perturbations. 2) For max aggregator, it usually fails to be aware of the detailed information of node representations within neighborhood. To overcome these issues, we re-think the message propagation mechanism in GNNs and develop the new general nonlinear aggregators for neighborhood information aggregation in GNNs. One main aspect of our nonlinear aggregators is that they all provide the optimally balanced aggregator between max and mean/sum aggregators. Thus, they can inherit both i) high nonlinearity that enhances network's capacity, robustness and ii) detail-sensitivity that is aware of the detailed information of node representations in GNNs’ message propagation. Promising experiments show the effectiveness, high capacity and robustness of the proposed methods.

AB  - Facial expression is one of the most effective and universal ways to express emotions and intentions. It reflects what a person is thinking or experiencing. Thus, the expression recognition is one of the key aspects of understanding non-verbal communication and interpreting emotions in social interactions. Some emotions are very confusing, and separating the features between them becomes difficult because they share the same feature space. For example, the distinction between fear, anger, and disgust is confusing. This work tried to improve the model’s class-wise performance to detect each class correctly. A distinct combination of deep-learning models is used to calculate the performance of the model, such as ResNet, XceptionNet, DenseNet, etc. The datasets like Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) & Facial Expression Recognition 2013 Plus (FER+) are used to evaluate the model’s performance. The proposed model achieved better results and overcame the previous work’s limitations. CDE’s performance on RAF-DB and FER+ evaluations was significantly better than the current SOTA methods, with an increase in accuracy of 5.18% and 3.98%, respectively.

AB  - The real recommendation will involve not only unsurprised, but some surprised elements sometimes. We are constantly experiencing this serendipity element in our daily life. However, today's data mining technology cannot support this function adequately. In this paper, we hypothesize that there should be some relevant serendipity elements on a radio station's music playlist. The radio station makes the playlist for the programme by the producer or director based on his experience and huge knowledge of music. In this research, we first determine the optimal number of clusters to be used by using BIC and AIC, and then we apply EM model clustering technique for the collection of more than 3000 playlists from the radio station. By analyzing the resulting clusters obtained, significant dependency between clusters and all the playlist metadata (i.e. time, genre, music era, and popularity) are discovered. Finally, we found that the time of playing the music and the music era (composed-year of music) has a strong correlation. This implies that music in some particular music era is popular in certain particular time of the day. For example, more classical music pieces from modern era are played at the night from 18:00 until 2:00. Furthermore, more classical music from the early Baroque era has been played in the afternoon around 12.00 to 13.00. However, we think that some music, which belong to the music era that are less popular in that particular time, will contribute to the serendipity function of the playlist to certain extend. With these studies, this serendipity would be widely used for an excellent recommendation service, which will include the personal radio station for the digital music player, marketing and knowledge capital.

AB  - Understanding the interplay between technology and urban life is the basic question of urban computing research. In addition to using context to achieve realism in evaluation, urban computing studies often need to consider context of use outright as an element under study. Doing so requires new ways of thinking about context that may not fit neatly into traditional categories of experimental design. In this paper we present our experiences in attempting to manage context in studies involving urban way finding and other social spatial activities. We reflect on our attempts to treat context as a set of controllable factors, to integrate some uncontrolled aspects of context into our experiments, and to engage contextual realism outright. The paper concludes with recommendations for managing context in urban computing study design based on these experiences.

Our research aims to provide enhanced understanding of complex systems through participatory interaction with our dynamic simulation models. Previous research has indicated that virtual and tangible models are well suited for use in informal education spaces, as they increase user interaction and curiosity amongst children and adults. We designed and implemented an interactive virtual environment as well as an interactive tangible “water computer” to represent the complex interspecies behavior of Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamic system. We designed our simulation models for use in informal STEM education settings, with a design focus on enhanced interactions and reflexive thinking.

AB  - An important aspect of engineering undergraduate learning is the assessment techniques as they determine the extent to which the expected so desired learning outcomes of a particular program can be measured. With the growing demands of industrial needs globally, the learning outcomes of most engineering programs do not just linger on technical skills, but equally important, if not more, on the communication skills, teamwork skills and other such process skills. Educationists thus seek for alternatives to the traditional pencil and paper tests as this instrument is useful and regarded a good measuring tool, but limited to measuring thinking skills only. Amongst the examples of alternative assessment methods is the portfolio. This research attempts to show how team-based electronic learning portfolio construction in the learning of Differential Equations is integrated as an assessment method at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, a private university located in Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia was employed to encompass a more comprehensive measure of students' learning in three learning domains; cognitive, affective and psychomotor. Involving over two hundred engineering undergraduates, the researcher with the assistance of two other colleagues uses a criterion-based scoring rubric to evaluate the construction of a randomly selected sample of fifteen from a pool of fifty one electronic Differential Equations Learning Portfolio or acronym, e-DELP. It is interesting to note the various levels of learning from the three learning domains; cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains that could be related to the activities involved in the construction of the team-based e-DELP. Time consuming it may be, but with proper planning, this alternative assessment is found to be well-worth implementing in achieving the objectives of measuring more than technical skills of students.

AB  - Deep learning's progress has resulted in a multi-layered character in a variety of applications in this field. Artificial Neural Networks are becoming the old procedure in the wide region of computing, using fifty-year-old principal concepts and models. Scientists are now presenting 3rd generation intelligent models in this current computer era. The brain like a big computer, routes information that it receives from the senses and body, and sends communications back to the body. But the brain can do much more than a machine can: humans think and experience reactions with their brain, and are the root of human intelligence. The 3rd generation Spiking Neural Network bridges the gap between deep learning, machine learning, and neuroscience in a biological approach, allowing neuroscience and machine learning to work together to achieve high-level computing efficiency using the neuromorphic computing. Spiking Neural Networks promise to make use of spikes, which are discrete functions that occur at predictable emphases rather than continuous values so that they are hardware implementable as well.

AB  - Studying computer programming requires not only an understanding of theories and concepts but also coding adeptness. Success in studying or conducting such a course is definitely a challenge. This paper proposes a systematic learning style recommendation. The model is designed to evaluate students' attributes and ongoing or formative learning outcomes for suggesting the effective style-fit strategy that facilitates learners to enhance their learning performances in terms of knowledge and skill. A two-stage association analysis was designed and conducted on a dataset collected from IT major students who enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Programming course. The first stage of association rules is to analyze and discover important relationships amongst learning styles, students' attribute, and learning performance. The second stage of moderation analysis is then applied to probe the moderation effect of the different learning preferences on the relationship between student attributes and learning achievement. Experiments expose many insights, for example, mathematics and logical thinking are powerful assets of success in computer programming study. Association rules can effectively identify associations of learning styles and the learning performance in terms of knowledge or skills. By moderation analysis, students in the “Excellent” cluster have a broad learning style than other students. Two types of significant moderators, the universal and specific, exemplify how lecturers can flexibly post style-fit teaching strategies for a class-wide and specific group, respectively.

AB  - The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed debate about whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conscious or sentient. This paper identifies two approaches to the topic and argues: (1) A “Cartesian” approach treats consciousness, sentience, and personhood as very similar terms, and treats language use as evidence that an entity is conscious. This approach, which has been dominant in AI research, is primarily interested in what consciousness is, and whether an entity possesses it. (2) An alternative “Hobbesian” approach treats consciousness as a sociopolitical issue and is concerned with what the implications are for labeling something sentient or conscious. This both enables a political disambiguation of language, consciousness, and personhood and allows regulation to proceed in the face of intractable problems in deciding if something “really is” sentient. (3) AI systems should not be treated as conscious, for at least two reasons: (a) treating the system as an origin point tends to mask competing interests in creating it, at the expense of the most vulnerable people involved; and (b) it will tend to hinder efforts at holding someone accountable for the behavior of the systems. A major objective of this paper is accordingly to encourage a shift in thinking. In place of the Cartesian question—is AI sentient?—I propose that we confront the more Hobbesian one: Does it make sense to regulate developments in which AI systems behave as if they were sentient?

Thus, network need to have strong and strict security. There are lots of criminal and unwanted ways to destroy the data integrity and confidentiality. It is import to prevent and block those illigal ways. This paper focus on Beth dataset. This analysis will give an insight of the Beth dataset. This gives researcher scientist an idea to if they can use this dataset to build strong and efficient anomaly detection model for the network.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new paradigm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is giving different AI/ Machine Learning (ML) models a boost to penetrate sectors where people are thinking about adopting AI. This work focuses on the adoption of XAI in the health sector. It portrays that careful integration of XAI in both cloud and edge could change the whole healthcare industry and make humans more aware of their present health conditions, which is the need of the hour. To demonstrate the same, we have done an experiment based on the prediction of a particular medical condition called "cardiac arrest" in a specific subject group (patients who are 70 years old). Here, based on the explanation provided by the XAI model (e.g., SHAP, LIME) at Cloud and Edge, our system can predict the chances of a "cardiac arrest" for the subject with a valid explanation. This type of model will be the next big upgrade in the healthcare industry in terms of automation and a self-explanatory system that works as a personal health assistant for individuals.

AB  - Digital humans are a highly realistic form of conversational computer agent. Eye gaze is a salient social cue that digital humans could use to facilitate rapport-building during conversations. However, eye gaze tendencies vary by gender and incorrect gaze patterns can have negative social implications. Analysis of observational data during human conversations can help inform the development of eye gaze models for digital humans. This study aimed to identify the eye gaze patterns of women dyads during a rapport-building conversation, and to evaluate the effect of different gaze patterns on rapport, trust, and psychological outcomes. 36 adult women (18 dyads) completed the Relationship Closeness Induction Task while wearing eye tracking glasses. Subjective rapport, trust, and psychological measures were collected. Gaze patterns of women were found to change as the conversation content became more intimate; specifically, gaze aversions for thinking (p=.042), turn-taking (p=.025), and intimacy modulation increased in duration (p=.012). Furthermore, gaze patterns were associated with perceptions of the conversation partner. Displaying fewer cognitive gaze aversions was associated with greater closeness (p=.029) and trust perceptions (p=.035). Longer periods of direct gaze while speaking was associated with greater rapport (p=.040). Results will inform the development of a humanlike gaze model for female digital humans during intimate conversations and may be applicable to social robots.

AB  - Mental health is just as important as physical health. Globally, there is a growing concern due to the rise of mental health problems. Mental health problems impair individuals’ ability to think clearly, behave responsively, or express themselves. The recent pandemic has led to a spike in people using social media to express themselves. Data from these social media platforms can be used to learn more about users’ mental states and determine the causes of mental health problems. However, due to the variability and complexity of users’ language, it is very challenging for conventional machine learning and deep learning models to identify these causes. In this research, we propose a novel sentence-level analysis framework based on a hybrid deep learning model to overcome these challenges. We evaluated our model’s efficacy using data from the social media platform Reddit, and our model outperforms several baseline models. Our research findings provide a new perspective on identifying the causes behind mental health issues and would help mental health professionals develop better diagnoses and treatments for patients.

AB  - End-to-end encryption is the best way to protect digital messages. Historically, end-to-end encryption has been extremely difficult for people to use, but recent tools have made it more broadly accessible, largely by employing key-directory services. These services sacrifice some security properties for convenience. We wanted to understand how average users think about these tradeoffs. We conducted a 52-person user study and found that participants could learn to understand properties of different encryption models. They also made coherent assessments about when different tradeoffs might be appropriate. Participants recognized the less-convenient exchange model was more secure overall, but considered the security of the registration model to be “good enough” for most everyday purposes.

AB  - The Computer General Course is a general core course in higher education for students of non-computer science majors. With the increasing popularity of computer technology applications and the arrival of the fourth wave of the industrial revolution represented by the industrialization of the Internet, industrial intelligence, and industrial integration, the teaching of Computer General Course under the new situation also faces new dilemmas. The exploration of the integration of C-STEAM with the Computer General Course, which is oriented by culture, provides new paths to achieve the educational goal under the new situation, to realize the integration of the discipline education under the cultural orientation of the course, and to improve the students' sense of learning efficacy in the course. Through the design-based research and 2 years of exploration and practice, combined with student research and work evaluation, the curriculum reform teaching practice recognition and students' cultural literacy, thinking methods, disciplinary integration literacy, etc. have received more positive feedback, and the teaching objectives are achieved to a higher degree.

AB  - Accurate software cost and schedule estimation are essential for software project success. Often it referred to as the "black art" because of its complexity and uncertainty, software estimation is not as difficult or puzzling as people think. In fact, generating accurate estimates is straightforward - once you understand the intensity of uncertainty and framework for the modeling process. The mystery to successful software estimation - distilling academic information and real-world experience into a practical guide for working software professionals. Instead of arcane treatises and rigid modeling techniques, this will guide highlights a proven set of procedures, understandable formulas, and heuristics that individuals and development teams can apply to their projects to help achieve estimation proficiency with choose appropriate development approaches In the early stage of software life cycle project manager are inefficient to estimate the effort, schedule, cost estimation and its development approach. This in turn, confuses the manager to bid effectively on software project and choose incorrect development approach. That will directly effect on productivity cycle and increase level of uncertainty. This becomes a strong cause of project failure. So to avoid such problem if we know level and sources of uncertainty in model design, It will directive the developer to design accurate software cost and schedule estimation. Which are essential for software project success. However once the required efforts have estimated, little is done to recalibrate and reduce the uncertainty of the initial estimates. This paper demonstrates terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modeling process, Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment its interaction with the broader system development process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modeling processes.. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modeling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed.

AB  - VR technology refers to virtual reality technology, which can simulate all kinds of things in the real environment, make users integrate into the simulation world and personally experience the change laws and specific characteristics of things [1]. At present, the application of virtual reality technology in training has become a major development trend of physical education. This model can help students improve the effect of physical education learning and further deepen their thinking mode and understanding of knowledge [2]. Combined with virtual reality technology and computer technology, this paper establishes a key action correction method of basketball training based on virtual reality technology. This system is composed of three-dimensional simulation database, capture motion virtual simulation model, motion technology simulation and other parts. The three-dimensional simulation of basketball based on virtual reality technology focuses on the principle, implementation method and specific application of virtual reality technology in the three-dimensional simulation of basketball. Using this method can bring more superior learning environment for athletes.

AB  - Feedback controllers are typically applied to computing systems by acting on some quantities (“tunable parameters” in the computer science lexicon, think e.g. of a packet drop rate) in order to attain some goal (e.g., a required bandwidth allocation). In other words, control loops are closed around the computing system, that exposes tunable parameters as control actuators, and allows to measure some performance metrics. In the authors' opinion, the “classical” use of control methods sketched above heavily limits the achievable results. Indeed, many critical parts of computing systems should not be “controlled”, but rather “re-designed in the form of controllers” - quite a novel approach and an interesting research area. This manuscript formalises the statement above and illustrates some results, including a couple of application examples, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed design approach.

AB  - Big data is envisioned as a game changer capable of revolutionizing the way businesses operate in sectors. The purpose of this paper is to present a big-data-based framework for dealing with electricity consumption behavior. This paper conducts an analysis of methodologies in the extraction of electro-information and drawbacks in modeling power consumption behavior through traditional peak-trough pricing. Then, the paper comes up with a fresh thinking on integration of multiple-dimensional, big data platforms, and conducts a penetrating study of pattern identification, relational analysis and deeds of using electricity. The paper designs a data-driven approach on the basis of two huge data manipulation techniques, batch process and flow process, and puts forward an algorithm concerning stochastic matrix relevance, which goes for the relationship between electricity spending and its determinants. Also, empirical evidence is presented concerning verifying robustness and validity of the proposed approach, suggesting that the framework is feasible in performing further electrical data analytics. The paper concludes with pointing out implications for governmental policy formulation, business expansion of power companies and guiding behavior of electricity use as well as quantitative methods for researching related issues.

AB  - Extant literature shows different measures for business performance of a 'for-profit' organisation; including both financial performance and non-financial dimensions. Key financial performance measures, evident in existing literature, include: profit; revenue; cash flow; and return on investment, among others. Some previous scholars highlighted that without a healthy cash flow, an organisation can fail to sustain itself, even when it records huge profits and high return on investment. This paper explores further the issue of cash flow, as a key financial (and business) performance measure, with a particular focus on controls taken by an Engineering Consultant during the design stage of project execution when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall. A System Dynamics conceptual model of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow controls (and their associated unintended and undesirable effects) is formulated, in this paper, from existing literature, mental models of contemporary project managers (from an Engineering Consulting firm with many infrastructure projects in South Africa), and Systems Thinking. Results suggest some counterintuitive dynamic hypothesis: controls taken by an Engineering Consultant (aimed at increasing his/her project cash flow) when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall, tend to generate some unintended and counteractive effect - a reduction of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining interest as an emerging paradigm for healthcare improvement. Cyber-security is one of the major issues breaking down its expansion. Indeed, IoMT ecosystem complexities and cyber-attacks development require thinking about smart and efficient security solutions. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are widely used to help detecting abnormalities and intrusions in such environments in order to improve trustworthiness in Connected Medical Devices (CMD). Towards this direction, risk assessment is also proposed to proactively evaluate the security of such platforms. Regarding the complexity and heterogeneity of IoMT, dealing with the inherent security risks is a challenging task. In this context, we aim to evaluate the cumulative risk of CMD based on anomaly detection in IoMT traffic via ML algorithms. Our model relies on anomalies detection coupled with intrinsic risk assessment of medical devices trying to have a holistic risk evaluation for the platform.

AB  - Researchers have proposed numerous consistency models in distributed systems that offer higher performance than classical sequential consistency (SC). Even though these models do not guarantee sequential consistency; they either behave like an SC model under certain restrictive scenarios, or ensure SC behavior for a part of the system. We propose a different line of thinking where we try to accurately estimate the number of SC violations, and then try to adapt our system to optimally tradeoff performance, resource usage, and the number of SC violations. In this paper, we propose a generic theoretical model that can be used to analyze systems that are comprised of multiple sub-domains - each sequentially consistent. It is validated with real world measurements. Next, we use this model to propose a new form of consistency called social consistency, where socially connected users perceive an SC execution, whereas the rest of the users need not. We create a prototype social network application and implement it on the Cassandra key-value store. We show that our system has 2.4× more throughput than Cassandra and provides 37% better quality-of-experience.

AB  - One of the shortcomings of many modern serious games and medical simulations lies in their inability to model even some modicum of unpredictability of real life situations. Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.

AB  - Simulation involves modeling and analysis of real-world systems. This tutorial will provide a broad overview of the modeling practice within simulation by introducing the reader to modeling choices found using six dimensions: abstraction, complexity, culture, engineering, environment, and process. Modeling can be a daunting task even for the seasoned modeling and simulation professional, and so my goal is to introduce modeling in two ways: 1) to use one specific type of model (Petri Net) as an anchor for cross-dimensional discussion, and 2) to provide a follow up discussion, with additional non Petri Net examples, to clarify the extent of each dimension. For example, in the abstraction dimension, one must think about scale, refinement, and hierarchy when modeling regardless of the type of modeling language. The reader will come away with a broad framework within which to understand the possibilities of models and of modeling within the practice of simulation.
