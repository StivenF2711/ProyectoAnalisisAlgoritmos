AB  - The government of Japan has announced the new ICT policy in June 2010. One of the points of the new policy is to start the 3D motion image content market in order to create new key industries in the near future as 3D motion image content will become most powerful media for CGM (Consumer Generated Media). In order to activate 3D motion image content industries, the development of an effective and simple tool for making 3D motion image content even by non-experienced people, is required. The Digital Movie Director (DMD) developed by the author, is being evolved as such an effective and simple tool. However, the big computational power requirement in making 3D motion image content has prevented DMD from being widely deployed. The cloud computing technology is supposed to solve this problem, thus, in this paper, the future prospects of the 3D motion image content industries with the cloud computing technology will be explained.

AB  - The electronics industry, driven by consumer demand for more computational capability crossed the nanoscale “threshold” in the late 1990s and was recognized as the first industry to do so. As a result, in certain areas, electrical engineering has been at the forefront of introducing nanotechnology concepts into traditional curriculum courses. Over the last decade nanotechnology has influenced and been integrated into multiple industries [1]. As a result, nanoscience concepts have been infused into multiple curricula yet has not lost some of the “electrical” foundations. Tracing a history of nanotechnology education through the last 15 years and into the future the influence, available resources and integration of nanoscale concepts will be assessed. The evolution of nanotechnology education covered will assess common elements that cross disciplinary boarders and highlight areas that have been left unaddressed. The successful implementation of programs will be employed to demonstrate the ideas presented.

AB  - The current study is to determine whether people mentally simulate the movement when they process fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., xiăo ji̅ng zŏu rù se̅n lín “A trail goes to the forest”), which literally include no movement in a space but implicitly entail the motion in our conceptual system. We conducted a depiction task to instruct participants in drawing what they thought when they read fictive motion sentences and non-fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese. After the drawing task, three participants that did not join the drawing task judged whether the trajectory was lengthened or not in the pictures according to their intuition. The experimental results show that trajectories depicted for the fictive motion sentences were judged significantly more lengthened than those for the non-fictive motion sentences. The findings of our study suggest even though there is no explicit movement involving in the meanings of fictive motions in Mandarin, people automatically simulate the movement and the trajectories. This study has practical implication for computational linguistics in analyzing subtle semantic meanings among motion verbs.

AB  - The stable constraint conditions of cascade PID controller were obtained by generalized Hermite-Biehler theorem, and an optimal controller was researched. Through mind evolutionary algorithm(MEA), optimal cascade PID controller parameters were found. According to the defects lying in mind evolutionary algorithm, the niche technique is developed to improve MEA in this paper. The swarm is classified and reduced the searching zone, which keeps the swarm diversity and to speed up optimization. Based on parameter optimization and tuning for the main steam temperature cascade control systems in power plants with serious parameter uncertainty, multi-disturbance and large delay, the simulation results show that this method has the advantages of fast optimization and low computational complexity; it is very effective for cascade PID parameter optimization and endues main steam temperature control systems with better control qualities and better system robustness.

AB  - Studying how intelligence analysts use interaction in visualization systems is an important part of evaluating how well these interactions support analysis needs, like generating insights or performing tasks. Intelligence analysis is inherently a fluid activity involving transitions between mental and interaction states through analytic processes. A gap exists to complement these transitions at micro-analytic level during data exploration or task performance. We propose Behavioural markers (BMs) which are representatives of the action choices that analysts make during their analytical processes as the bridge between human cognition and computation through semantic interaction. A low level semantic action sequence computation technique has been proposed to extract these BMs from captured process log. Our proposed computational technique can supplement the problems of existing qualitative approaches to extract such BMs.

AB  - In recent years, with the extensive application of artificial intelligence in various fields, the research on how to apply artificial intelligence to education has gradually become the focus of attention. Knowledge map is a giant semantic network composed of nodes and edges, which represents the semantic association between different nodes in the form of large-scale graph. Knowledge map, as a structured storage form of multi-domain data in the real world, provides semantic relevance between data and makes it possible for artificial intelligence to make better use of data. The research of representation learning based on knowledge map realizes the distributed representation of entities and relationships, significantly improves the computational efficiency, effectively alleviates the problem of data sparseness and can realize the fusion of heterogeneous information, which is of great significance for people to obtain effective information from massive data. In view of the above situation, taking WebQA data set as an example, this paper proposes a method to simplify the original text, introduce apriori knowledge related to answers from the knowledge map, and use neural network model to generate Chinese questions. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the difficulty of model training and improve the quality of model problems.

AB  - Openflow provides a key step in abstracting network functions by separating the control and the forwarding plane. However, current rather rigid switches constrain packet processing programmability. It is therefore complex to implement flexible packet classification within existing ASIC-based switches, especially when forwarding switches rely on a restricted set of tables. In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism for assigning rule entries to switch tables. Accordingly, we propose a conceptual abstraction that tailors Openflow forwarding paths to the hardware switch. Our approach aims to provide an optimal mapping of entries to physical tables. Its main idea consists in using a semantic analysis to reflect the computational relation between rules and a set of packet descriptors characterized by predefined table entries.

In this paper, the application of CAD and multimedia technology is combined to carry out the industrial design methods and experience. From the perspective of the overall process of the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the design expression of the modern creativity, Chinese traditional handicrafts still have great research value in the process of promoting the expression of the modern creative design. The existing creative design expression methods have the problems of high feature dimensions, large computational overhead or relatively low detection rate and so on. In this paper, a kind of traditional Chinese handicrafts that promote the expression of the modern creative design based on the computer multimedia technology is put forward. This method is aimed at the modern creative processing of the traditional Chinese handicrafts, using the computer multimedia technology to process the traditional Chinese handicrafts. The experimental results show that this method has relatively low time complexity and high detection rate than those of the traditional methods. In addition, it has relatively good robustness for the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the expression of the modern creative design.

AB  - Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.

AB  - It has been reported that human thoughts processes of sensory-motor functions as well as high level of cognitive processes may be highly reproducible between multiple trials as measured via functional MRI data. This trend of the reproducibility seems consistent between multiple subjects as well. We have also presented in our earlier study that six distinct thought processes were shown highly consistent spatial patterns of activations as evaluated from automated classification performance. In the present study, this automated classification performance was compared depending on the feature vector selection methods. A general linear model (GLM) was adopted to define a neuronal activity and voxel-based or atlas-based approaches were adopted as feature vector selection methods. The classification results showed superior performance from the voxel-based feature selection method than the atlas-based method. Nonetheless, when multiple atlases were used to defined feature vector elements, the resulting performance was comparable to that of the voxel-based method with greatly reduced computational time.

AB  - In the present paper, an autonomation system based on fuzzy logic is proposed for a steel wire rolling mill to minimize a quality problem related to surface finish. Autonomation is a lean manufacturing concept that integrates automation with a human factor. The ability of self-diagnosis is achieved in the automated line by incorporating a computational intelligence tool like fuzzy logic. The decision support model proposed here provides intelligent decisive signals similar to the fuzzy capability of human brain. Fuzzy Logic control (FLC) model is designed to recognize the events that are likely to create defects and output action signals are generated. Speed difference between conveyor rollers and rolled products, percentage of carbon content and impact force on groove rollers are the three inputs and it produces two outputs in the form of either Andon (a visual signal) or line stoppage. By using Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) autonomation system, surface defects can be prevented by monitoring level of inputs.

AB  - Fog Computing (FC) has extended the services of cloud computing to the edge of the network. It inherits some of the characteristics from cloud computing but FC also have some distinguished features such as geo-distribution, location awareness and low latency. Along with the inherited characteristics, it also inherits the issues and problems of cloud computing like energy efficiency, resource management and security issues. This paper presents the critical analysis of the fog architecture with respect to security. The state of the art work done since 2012 is critical analyzed on the bases of security techniques and security threats. We grouped the existing security techniques on the bases of security goals achieved by each. It will provide a clear and comprehensive distinction between the security areas explored and those, which still need researchers' attention.

AB  - In this paper, we study roles of social mechanisms in a financial system. Our data come from a novel on-line foreign exchange trading brokerage for individual investors, which also allows investors to form social network ties between each other and copy others' trades. From the dataset, we analyze the dynamics of this connected social influence systems in decision making processes. We discover that generally social trades outperform individual trades, but the social reputation of the top traders is not completely determined by their performance due to social feedback even when users are betting their own money. We also find that social influence plays a significant role in users' trades, especially decisions during periods of uncertainty. We report evidences suggesting that the dynamics of social influence contribute to market overreaction.

It was organized in the context of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS 2015). The goal of this competition was to set a common platform for evaluation of the recent development in sclera segmentation and also to attract the attention of researchers to this new area. In this regard, we have prepared a Multi-Angle Sclera Dataset (MASD) version 1. It is comprised of 2624 RGB images taken from both the eyes of 82 identities. In other words, it consists of images of 164 (82*2) different eyes. Moreover, we have prepared manual segmentation masks of these images to create the baseline. We have, furthermore, adopted precision and recall-based statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness and the ranks of the competing algorithms. To summarize, ten participants registered for the competition, and among them four participants submitted their algorithms/ systems. The results achieved by these algorithms reflect noteworthy developments in the literature of sclera segmentation employing cutting edge segmentation techniques. Along with the algorithm of the four competing teams and their results, the MASD version 1 dataset will also be freely available for research purposes from the organizer's website.

AB  - Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (Chat-GPT) and related Generative AI models are leading a paradigm shift in the acceptance and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all disciplines and industry sectors. Despite the criticisms of an ‘intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth’, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.

Conversational LLM services, such as Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT, offer students access to many abilities such as summarization and generation of text and code, and on-demand replies to questions on expert topics. In this paper, we observe ChatGPT to explore how LLM services impact learning and instruction in higher education. First, we mapped the capabilities of the system by reviewing the grey literature on ChatGPT and using the system ourselves for two months. Second, we selected a Bachelor level computer science curriculum from a Finnish university, and examined the impact of ChatGPT on the offered courses. As an outcome of this study, we highlight 13 implications for students' learning in higher education, and discuss the contemporary future of AI-assisted learning in universities and beyond.

AB  - To exploit the benefits of throughput-optimized processors such as GPUs, applications need to be redesigned to achieve performance and efficiency. In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel. Another contribution of the paper is a critical graph analysis technique to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo based SSTA, leading to 2-9X further speedup.

AB  - Pictorial visualizations portray data with figurative messages and approximate the audience to the visualization. Previous research on pictorial visualizations has developed authoring tools or generation systems, but their methods are restricted to specific visualization types and templates. Instead, we propose to augment pictorial visualization authoring with visual style transfer, enabling a more extensible approach to visualization design. To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.

AB  - Can computers overcome human capabilities? This is a paradoxical and controversial question, particularly because there are many hidden assumptions. This article focuses on that issue putting on evidence some misconception related to future generations of machines and the understanding of the brain. It will discuss to what extent computers might reach human capabilities, and how it would be possible only if the computer is a conscious machine. However, it will be shown that if the computer is conscious, an interference process due to consciousness would affect the information processing of the system. Therefore, it might be possible to make conscious machines to overcome human capabilities, which will have similar limitations than humans. In other words, trying to overcome human capabilities with computers implies the paradoxical conclusion that a computer will never overcome human capabilities at all, or if the computer does, it should not be considered as a computer anymore.

AB  - Power system state estimation (SE) plays a crucial role in the success of advanced tools employed for power system analysis and control in Energy Management Systems. SE is responsible for providing a consistent real-time dataset, free from errors that may compromise decision-making and put the system at risk. The presence of criticalities involving elements such as network branches, measuring units or measurements may impose difficulties for the detection/identification of gross errors in the acquired data. The simultaneous unavailability of the elements that form a given criticality makes the grid unobservable. This paper presents a flexible and effective network-based methodology for the integrated identification of critical groups of branches, measurements and measuring units in SE. The proposed algorithms are constructed, having the properties of such criticalities as their central pillar. Tests performed with IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus benchmark systems are presented, and the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The interplay between pairs of critical factors such as performance, energy and reliability within modern computing systems has always been an interesting topic of study. However, studying the interplay of all three factors together in a many-core, multi-layer design setting has been a relatively recent undertaking. This work explores the practical problems encountered in such studies and introduces the modelling framework ArchOn, which is based on a novel resource-driven graph representation. ArchOn facilitates the analysis and potentially design and synthesis of systems whose design domains are more conveniently organized into multiple layers or levels (e.g. application, OS, hardware, etc.) and potentially large scale and diverse types of concurrency. The layer-agnostic formalism helps designers reason about cross-layer issues and the resource-driven approach is advantageous for reasoning about such issues as energy and time. Example single- and multi-core case studies help explain and illustrate the method.

AB  - The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.

AB  - This paper reports on a pilot study of using ChatGPT, a language model based on GPT-3.5 architecture, for automatic generation of metamorphic relations (MRs), in the context of testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications and limitations of using ChatGPT for MR generation and provide recommendations for future research. Our study contributes to the advancement of automated testing of ADSs, which is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in real-world scenarios.

AB  - Edge Intelligence (EI) based collaborative learning approaches have been researched in the recent years by several researchers. As majority of existing collaborative learning approaches are designed in the context of servers, design and development of novel systems are required in order to apply collaborative learning in resource constrained devices. Researchers possess different interpretations of the existing collaborative learning approaches. This paper presents an analysis of the existing work conducted on collaborative learning approaches on the domain of EI. The strongholds and drawbacks of the existing work will be analyzed to identify an ideal collaborative learning approach to be applied on the Internet of things (IoT) edge. The analysis will further include an investigation into the future enhancements and research gaps. The partitioned model training approach has been identified as the most ideal approach for the IoT edge based on the conducted critical analysis process. The reduction of communication overhead in the partitioned model training approach and the application of the partitioned model training approach in other unexplored deep learning model architectures have been identified as future research directions. This paper is a work in progress section of an ongoing research and in the future the findings will be used to design a system to apply the collaborative learning approach in IoT Edge and bridge the existing research gaps.

AB  - Recently, audio concepts emerged as a useful building block in multimodal video retrieval systems. Information like "this file contains laughter", "this file contains engine sounds" or "this file contains slow music" can significantly improve purely visual based retrieval. The weak point of current approaches to audio concept detection is that they heavily rely on human annotators. In most approaches, audio material is manually inspected to identify relevant concepts. Then instances that contain examples of relevant concepts are selected -- again manually -- and used to train concept detectors. This approach comes with two major disadvantages: (1) it leads to rather abstract audio concepts that hardly cover the audio domain at hand and (2) the way human annotators identify audio concepts likely differs from the way a computer algorithm clusters audio data -- introducing additional noise in training data. This paper explores whether unsupervized audio segementation systems can be used to identify useful audio concepts by analyzing training data automatically and whether these audio concepts can be used for multimedia document classification and retrieval. A modified version of the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) speaker diarization system finds segments in an audio track that have similar perceptual properties and groups these segments. This article provides an in-depth analysis on the statistic properties of similar acoustic segments identified by the diarization system in a predefined document set and the theoretical fitness of this approach to discern one document class from another.

AB  - This paper describes the use of different and complementary teaching tools on two consecutive courses on Soil Mechanics (on an integrated master in Civil Engineering). In these courses, project-based learning with collaborative or cooperative teamwork was implemented. The teaching tools adopted and described herein include text processors, spreadsheets and presentations, as well as specialized geotechnical software. The students' perceptions were collected using a questionnaire and the impact of those different tools on the students' perceptions are analysed. Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes. Getting students on board, by discussing the aims of using specific strategies, is key to promote academic success. Therefore, students must be the centre of all the teaching and learning processes.

Based on a case study of Innovation Labs, a tech accelerator implemented in Romania since 2013, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship competences that are sensitive to the potential and limitations of big data. Data capitalism has significant implications not only in our everyday life and business, but also on the instruments that we employ to understand the world and to achieve value. The data-based society needs complex information technology to process information, to observe, to map, to extract, to put together streams of data which eventually are leading to decision making and to value creation, including - but not limited to - financial value. Big data applications gather data from heterogeneous activity fields and seek to create insights through their cross-sectional interpretation. How are young tech-oriented people equipped to navigate the data-storm that this global current of digitalization and automation is creating? We will look at the case of Innovation Labs tech accelerator, by analyzing the last four editions of the program in terms of working with (big) data.

AB  - Maker education for entrepreneurship and innovation is an important mission of China universities. However, current maker education in China universities has the limitations of closed innovation, efficiency-driven, focal product, specialized organization, and so on. This failed to meet makers' demands for real-time awareness of space, adaptive automatic resources, diverse innovation activities and tools with intelligent support in makerspace. Therefore, the innovation ecosystem has emerged to be the best choice to solve those problems. This paper first analyses fundamental principles and elements of innovation ecosystem, and then discusses essentials and properties of innovation ecosystem-oriented maker(IEOM) education. After that, the model of IEOM education by smart technologies is developed, including innovation subject, innovation activity, and innovation environment. Innovative subjects include experiencers, innovators, researchers and experts. Innovation activities are created by the innovation subjects including interest, research, practice and smart creation. The innovation environment is a creation scenario reflecting innovative subjects' rich creation in participating in innovation activities.

AB  - The call for empowering women to participate fully in all sectors of society posits that women's participation is key to economic growth, political stability, and social transformation. Approaches to achieve such participation, however, are trivialized due to existing gender biases and women continue to lag behind in STEM professions. In this article I argue for the transformative power of an interdisciplinary mindset - particularly one engendered by a STEAM education whereby `A' stands for Arts-as a catalyst for STEM careers and beyond. Furthermore, I conclude that STEAM will prevail in the hands of interdisciplinary leaders.

AB  - In March 2020, due to the pandemic linked to the COVID-19 virus spreading, all in-person teaching activities planned at the University of Salerno were suspended. This sudden suspension has forced the academic world to rethink in a short time the didactics and to modify teaching styles and approaches, especially in those courses in which laboratory activities were planned. This article will be presented the experiences made in the Computer Networks and Protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) course. The course includes a significant laboratory component where students must put into practice what they learned during the theoretical lessons. In particular, the laboratory exercises involve using specific equipment and devices that can build digital ecosystems for the control and management of well-defined operational contexts difficult to reproduce virtually. Therefore, to give continuity to the didactic activity, it was necessary to redesign the entire exercise system preserving the original educational objectives.

The goal of this research is to investigate whether there is a significant difference between multiple intelligences and learning behavior of engineering students in the subject named Theory of Computation (TOC). This study intended to reveal how students differ in the ways they learn. Although, all the students are inclined to learn, however their way of learning is different from person to person as well in absorbing new information. Considering student's multiple intelligences this study was aimed at summarizing the ways in which ICT is used, and how it creates new learning opportunities. This study examines the impact of Multiple Intelligences on knowledge sharing and knowledge acquisition behavior.

AB  - This article reinterprets algorithmic rationality by looking at the interaction between mathematical logic, mechanized reasoning, and, later, computing in the Russian Imperial and Soviet contexts to offer a history of the algorithm as a mathematical object bridging the inner and outer worlds, a humanistic vision that we, following logician Vladimir Uspensky, call the “culture of the impossible.” We unfold the deep roots of this vision as embodied in scientific intelligentsia. In Part I, we examine continuities between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century discussions of poznaniye—an epistemic orientation towards the process of knowledge acquisition—and the postwar rise of the Soviet school of mathematical logic. Establishing this connection allows us to explain, in Part II, the role of the algorithm in disciplinary dynamics between mathematical logic and cybernetics and a characteristic understanding of programming, not as a narrow skill, but as a matter of consciousness.

AB  - This article proposes to examine the rise of intensive digitization and technification processes in daily life and the concomitant loss of former historically dominant premachine modes of existence and communication. We shed fresh light on the subject by conducting a historico-philosophical analysis of the evolution of the concept of the machine. The relation between technology and society is investigated in depth through the prism of culture in the latter and the concept of the machine in the former. The evolution of the technosphere is viewed as a series of mutations in the ontological structure of the machine, moving from the equipmental mode of the mechanical tool and ending up with the intelligent machine then the rhizomatic mode of machinic production. Our approach is multidisciplinary, drawing from several traditions, including science, sociology, the philosophy of technology, ontology, and history.

AB  - This Cloud Computing is the emerging trend in distributed computing that encourages researchers to investigate its pros and cons for executing scientific workflows. Scheduling of applications modeled as workflows and executed in high performance distributed computing environments like cloud is a computationally hard multi-objective optimization problem. However, it presents various challenges that need to be addressed in order to efficiently utilize cloud resources for workflow applications. In this paper, the authors have critically analyzed the workflow scheduling algorithms for its pros and cons and thereby identified the research issues in workflow scheduling algorithms. The theoretical analysis of `Enhanced Max-Min' scheduling algorithm suggests that if the algorithm is applied for workflow execution in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud, a higher efficiency/lower `makespan' can be achieved if the characteristics of resources are considered while scheduling workflow tasks. Hence the authors have also proposed an extension of `Enhanced Max-Min' algorithm for workflow execution that considers characteristics of resources and `makespan' minimization as a scheduling parameter.

AB  - We live in the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which permeates all aspects of our lives, from spam filtering to image classification on social media. While it is already well-established in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to the IT field, its impact on the design professions remains relatively unexplored. This essay explores the use of neural networks in architecture, which is arguably the first genuinely 21st-century design technique and discusses experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate unexplored futuristic possible noble forms in architecture. In this way this paper also raises the question if machine can generate noble forms through its creative data optimization process. In this process one of the most famous heritages building of Bangladesh 60 dome mosque (Shat Gombuj Moshjid) has been examined to get expected result. Furthermore, this paper discusses how AI can be used as a personalized tool for architects to generate and express design ideas. It evaluates popular datasets for architectural purposes and considers the potential outcomes of experiments. The input of AI in the design process could usher in a new era of architectural design. As data continues to grow, it is shaping our collective future. Therefore, this paper concludes that it is essential to prepare our trained datasets to accept the future which might open up an extraordinary new chapter in the architectural realm.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has been linked with significant deterioration of neuro-cognitive health. The forced abnormal isolation mandated by the lockdown has been associated with increased internal stressors, leading to early onset of mental health degeneration. The current challenge for the medical practitioners is to identify tools to help slow down such neurocognitive decline. In this project, we develop a model of sentiment manipulation using linguistic cues that can regulate the affective-motivational state of an individual to reduce triggers of neurocognitive degeneration. Based on the model insights, we build a user-friendly, low-cost Web App, customizable in many languages, to identify and score the primary sentiment of any audio or text to help reduce exposure to content that can potentially trigger internal stressors. In a randomized control experiment with 160 subjects, we find that participants in our target group who consumed content with positive or upbeat cues over a period of 60 days were 3.68 times less likely to report loneliness, 2.1 times less likely to report depressive thoughts and emotions and 1.75 times less likely to report forgetfulness than our control group, providing promising evidence of the potential of positive linguistic cues to prevent or slow down neuro-cognitive degeneration.

AB  - This paper proposes an architecture for developmental robot that can learn abstract concepts early on and use these concepts to reason and make decisions. We introduce a frame work of two macro-layers. The bottom layer takes the desired information (e.g., desired heading direction) as the input. The top macro-layer enables human teachers to interactively inject a representation of abstract concepts (e.g., location) into the developmental process. This architecture is applied to a navigation problem, and its superiority over one-layer architecture is confirmed in comparative experiments using simulated Lidar sensor data. The robotic navigation demonstrates its robustness in accomplishing complicated task in clutter outdoor environments.

AB  - Motivated learning is a new machine learning approach that extends reinforcement learning idea to dynamically changing, and highly structured environments. In this approach a machine is capable of defining its own objectives and learns to satisfy them though an internal reward system. The machine is forced to explore the environment in response to externally applied negative (pain) signals that it must minimize. In doing so, it discovers relationships between objects observed through its sensory inputs and actions it performs on the observed objects. Observed concepts are not predefined but are emerging as a result of successful operations. For the optimum development of concepts and related skills, the machine operates in the protective environment that gradually increases its complexity. Simulation illustrates the advantage of this gradual increase in environment complexity for machine development. Comparison to reinforcement learning indicates weakness of the later method in learning proper behavior, even in such protective environments with gradually increasing complexity. The method shows how mental development stimulates learning of new concepts and at the same time benefits from this learning. Thus the method addresses a well know problem of merging connectionist (bottom-up) and symbolic (top down) approaches for intelligent autonomous machine operation in developmental robotics.

AB  - Sri Lanka has taken the initiative through its new education reforms to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a compulsory content in the ICT curriculum of lower secondary education from 2025. This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants’ interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.

AB  - Is it possible to use stereo images to generate point clouds and to compute rigorous uncertainty maps? Currently, neither modern commercial photogrammetric software nor state-of-the-art algorithms are able to provide a spatial distribution of uncertainty. In this letter, we explain why this is the case, despite a high demand from the user community. Many applications would indeed benefit from the availability of error bars on each point, as uncertainties on derived models and quantities could be accurately predicted. For instance, change detection could be performed rigorously since the statistical significance of observed changes could be computed. In this letter, we focus on dense stereo methods. We first explain that it is not possible to derive reliable predictive uncertainties mainly due to matching and modeling errors. Our research shows that both intrinsic and practical limitations of the algorithms lead to unpredictable artifacts. Then, we focus on the use of empirical errors, showing that, despite the redundancy brought by multiview stereo, there is a fundamental limitation due to the unknown density of independent measurements. We think that these problems will represent a big challenge for the future, as these limitations cannot be addressed by algorithmic design, computational power, or imaging sensor technology.

AB  - In precision livestock farming, the individual identification of cattle is crucial to inform the decisions made to enhance animal welfare, health, and productivity. In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag’s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.

AB  - Recently, the interest in robots capable of experiencing empathy and displaying emotions has grown. This trend can be attributed to the pervasive presence of robots in many environments, such as homes, offices, museums, and hospitals, that require more empathic and reliable human-machine relationships. Recent studies demonstrated that providing the robot with the ability to think aloud improves humans’ trust in machines, as they can understand the underlying reasoning of the artifact, what conclusions it can draw, and why and how. This work integrates a robot’s inner speech mechanism with Damasio’s theory of emotions to make the robot functionally conscious of its emotional experience, leading to a computational model of Extended Consciousness, SUSAN (Self-dialogue Utility in Simulating Artificial Emotions). Damasio claims that emotions originate within the body and precede and influence the reasoning processes that make the person aware of them. According to his theory, Extended Consciousness refers to the humans’ cognitive processes that make the humans themselves aware of the physiological experiences of emotions purged by an external stimulus. SUSAN models the bodily emotional experience and simulates the awareness of the emergent emotion by using inner speech. The model is presented, and the initial results related to a use case are discussed.

AB  - Space permeates our thinking. Every organism must navigate the physical environment to find what it needs. Many organisms reorganize their environment, as illustrated by ant colonies, beaver dams, and cities. Understanding how to make and use tools, as crows and primates do, requires understanding interrelationships between space, shape, and forces. Understanding science, engineering, and mathematics deeply involves spatial thinking. Thus, understanding the repres ent at ions that underlie human thinking about space is one of the most important problems in understanding human cognition more broadly.

AB  - This work proposes a transformer-based model capable of generating music in its symbolic domain, in a controllable fashion. The ultimate goal of this is to build a system with which people can compose music collaboratively with a computer. Using an NLP model as a base (GPT-2), we take advantage of the similarities across symbolic music representation and written language to build a model capable of conditionally predicting musical sequences. Controllability is achieved without explicit programming for it, and does not require extensive retraining of the model. A study with 939 participants was performed to evaluate this controllability. The results of this suggest the proposed method is indeed effective and can be used to control the generation of music in its symbolic domain. The method itself is flexible to any desired “control”, but this work focuses specifically on the emotion conveyed when one listens to a piece of music.

AB  - Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.

AB  - Granular computing has advantage of knowledge discovery for complex data. In the paper, we present Fuzzy Granular Hyperplane Classifiers (FGHCs) for data classification from a new angle of Granular Computing. First, we introduce a fuzzy granular hyperplane concept by defining fuzzy granule, fuzzy granular vector, metrics and operators. Next, for binary classification problem, we present solving optimal fuzzy granular hyperplane through evolution strategy; the learning algorithm of parameters and the prediction algorithm of instances are also proposed. Finally, a multi-classification prediction model is designed by combining a set of Fuzzy Granular Hyperplane Classifiers based on vote strategy. In order to evaluate performance, we employed 10-fold cross validation to verify on UCI dataset and Alzheimer’s Disease Voice dataset. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrated that FGHCs have good performance.

AB  - Even without hearing or seeing individuals, humans are able to determine subtle emotions from a range of indicators and surroundings. However, existing research on emotion recognition is mostly focused on recognizing the emotions of speakers across complete modalities. In real-world situations, emotion reasoning is an interesting field for inferring human emotions from a person’s surroundings when neither the face nor voice can be observed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal approach for predicting emotion from missing one or more modalities based on attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ self-attention for each unimodal representation to extract the dominant features and utilize the compounded paired-modality attention (CPMA) among sets of modalities to identify the context of the considered individual, such as the interplay of modalities, and capture people’s interactions in the video. The proposed model is trained on the Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (MEmoR) dataset, which includes multimedia inputs such as visual, audio, text, and personality. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 50.63% for the primary emotion group and 42.7% for the fine-grained one. According to the results, our proposed model outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of emotion reasoning.

AB  - Recently, various text-to-image generative models have been released, demonstrating their ability to generate high-quality synthesized images from text prompts. Despite these advancements, determining the appropriate text prompts to obtain desired images remains challenging. The quality of the synthesized images heavily depends on the user input, making it difficult to achieve consistent and satisfactory results. This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a more efficient and automated approach to obtaining high-quality synthesized images. The findings indicate that prompt optimization may offer a promising pathway for text-to-image generative models.

AB  - The effects of soil dry density and water content are being examined through experimental time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) methods in correlation with electromagnetic simulations. The infiltration rate (hydraulic conductivity) of water in sand is exceptionally high, resulting in heterogeneous moisture distribution through the soil. The effective dielectric constant of the soil/water/air mixture is dependent on the soil's dry density and moisture content. Both TDR and FDR methods are performed on a coaxial transmission line filled with a soil/water/air mixture. The flow of the water through the soil creates a dynamic situation in which the soil/water/air electrical impedance changes over time. The resulting soil has heterogeneous water content, creating varying electrical impedance values along the length of the coaxial line. The soil compaction, i.e., dense or loose, has significant impact on the heterogeneity of the moisture content through the soil and the dry density of the soil. In each case, the effective dielectric constant is determined from the data collected from TDR and FDR experiments, and the values are compared with the predictions using established empirical models by Topp, Hilhorst, and Hendrickx. With the exception of the data represented as a function of the degree of saturation, the Hendrickx model appears to best represent the measured dielectric constants since it falls within two standard deviations of the measured data. A computer simulation technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used to supplement experimental observations of various soil moisture contents in a coaxial cell. Simulations confirm that the change in the dielectric constant through the soil is a result of the heterogeneous moisture distribution. It was found that the soil moisture content has a major impact on the resulting dielectric constant from measurements or modeling. In the coaxial-cell device, soil moisture migration during the testing period results in a heterogeneous moisture regime and a temporal dielectric constant. This is particularly exaggerated for high-hydraulic-conductivity soils such as sand.

AB  - The application of wide-band gap semiconductors and their integration with other power electronics components (e.g., passives, gate drivers, sensing, thermal management) can meet the growing demand for volume reduction in power electronics systems. The design of such an integrated system is a complex multiphysics problem given the high number of variables to identify, objectives to optimize, and constraints to satisfy. Traditionally, this complex problem is approached subdividing the design in different steps, where in each step, the single components are designed and optimized independently from the others. This might clearly overlook the effect that the design choices of a single subsystem has on other subsystems, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this article, an automated design approach is proposed with the aim of maximizing power density whilst minimizing total losses. As a vessel to investigate the presented optimization workflow, the magnetically coupled interleaved H-bridge topology is chosen as an emblematic example of multivariable design problem. The first step of this approach consists of developing a loss model of the converter, which takes into account components physical dimensions, the temperature dependence, and the circuit parasitics. In the second step, these models are used within a nested optimization procedure in order to estimate the losses for multiple points of load. With the aim of validating both design approach and optimization results, three different optimal solutions have been deeply analyzed with commercial suit, prototyped, and tested. The showed experimental results endorse the adopted design approach confirming the optimality/validity of the manufactured solutions.

AB  - In this paper, a checking system for eye lotion instillations of ophthalmology patients is proposed, using a neural network. It first estimates tilt angles of the eye dropper bottle from acceleration values measured by a triaxial sensor. A sequence of such estimated values is next presented to a discrimination model after network learning, and its output value is considered to be a certainty degree indicating whether an eye lotion is applied at the time zone corresponding to the sequence. The final judgement for the instillation is made by conducting thresholding of the certainty degree. The proposed method employs either a long short-term memory (LSTM for short) or a bidirectional long short-term memory (B_LSTM for short) to construct the discrimination model. Experimental results using practical data reveal that the B_LSTM-based model achieves favorable metric values compared to the LSTM-based model. In addition, it is explored whether the metric values depend on the interval between the time points when the tilt values are measured.

This method presents an approach that will be used for future work in design of the control system. The presented method is an extension of the actual developed control system of engine, which uses the theory of situational control of complex systems. This control system uses progressive control algorithms. For practical implementation of this control system it is important to think about computational complexity. Control systems of aircraft engines use computer (Full Authority Electronic engine control — FADEC) with limited computation resources. Aircraft engines work in environment with stochastic conditions. It is necessary to ensure reliable and stable operation of engine. Anytime algorithms can help to solve this problem and to meet the safety requirements.

This method is as follows: 1) The vocal tract characteristic is estimated by using the PARCOR analysis. 2) The voice sounds can be generated from the whisper voice by convoluting a periodic pitch with the estimated vocal tract characteristic. However, in 1), this method needs a lot of computational complexity to estimate the vocal tract characteristic. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of vocal tract characteristic with a little computational complexity using the blind estimation based on over sampling instead of PARCOR analysis method.

AB  - One from the most difficult tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to analyze poetry, which uses a different genre of language than that considered by computer-based techniques. Therefore, computational analysis is an interesting task when we use NLP in poetry, but it is also challenging. There are a number of researchers that entered this field from NLP and they got promising results using mathematical analysis for poetry, including rhythm analysis. In this paper we focused on providing solution for automating the rhythm detection of the Arabic poems and finding the number of rhythm for each verse in poem and the total percentage for each rhythm in all verses of poem, additional to other characteristics for the Arabic poem like percentage of mobile letter in Arabic “harf mutaharrik”, and The quiescent letter, in Arabic “harf sakin”, In spite of the number of studies in the computational analysis of poetry, we think it needs more, not only to make a better understanding of domain but also in developing applications, considering different literary tastes and the psychological effects, to give a recommendation to the readers and in plagiarism detection[1].

This special school caters to children who are severely mentally handicapped, and their day-to-day training consists of repetitive tasks that are designed to help them to express their needs to a certain degree. We will present (1) our timeline and detailed setting of our course which is different from traditional lecture setting. (2) the way to provide situated learning which helps our students to develop better, larger and more linked information. (3) the ways to provide constructivist teaching which helps our students to construct the knowledge of computational thinking and game engineering, so that it can improve their products and have a better interaction with the real world.

AB  - With the rapid development of DNA microarray technology, the application of informatics research methods in oncology is becoming more and more popular. Because the gene expression data extraction experiment has the characteristics of a large number of genes and complex and changeable experimental conditions, clustering technology has been introduced into the field of molecular biology to assist research and analyze gene expression data. Currently, many clustering algorithms are applied in gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, owing to the high dimensionality of gene expression data, many algorithms face the problem of low computational efficiency. The method based on the graph theory thinks of the sample of gene expression data as the point in high-dimensional space. Its low sample performance determines that the constructed matrix is small in size. Therefore, it has lower computational complexity. Therefore, the graph regularized non-negative matrices factorization (GNMF) proposed by Cai et al. has been widely used for gene clustering. However, the deficiency of the GNMF algorithm is unstable with data variation for gene clustering. In this paper, we propose post-processing of Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm for Gene Clustering, called pGNMF. In the pGNMF method, we first normalize the solution of GNMF, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the traditional GNMF method to the prior selection of genes or initial conditions, and effectively improving the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing GNMF algorithms for gene clustering.

AB  - This research goes into the intricate interplay of linguistic and psychological aspects in Doris Lessing’s fiction by conducting a computational analysis of verba sentiendi, or verbs of thinking. Drawing on applied linguistics, computational analysis, text, and discourse inquiry, we unravel the portrayal of characters’ thoughts/mental events through three categories of verba sentiendi: Thoughts and Opinions, Senses and Perceptions, Feelings and Emotions. By quantitatively examining the frequency values and interpreting descriptive statistics data, we shed light on the psychological dimensions that underlie Lessing’s fictional tapestry. Using cutting-edge tools such as Voyant and R/R Studio, we process vast volumes of textual data to quantify the prevalence of verba sentiendi across different categories, offering insights into their quantitative significance. Descriptive statistics provide further nuance by revealing central tendencies, variations, and quartiles within the three main categories under study.

AB  - Network Exchange Objects (NEO) is a new software framework designed to facilitate development of complex natural or built distributed system models, where the system model is represented as a graph, through which currencies (e.g., coding information) flux. This paper introduces "system-level hypothesis (SLH) testing" as a form of computational thinking that will drive integration of computational and empirical sciences to promote efficient, self- correcting inquiry into the operations and behavior of complex systems. To demonstrate NEO, we examine the problem of maximizing the productivity of a software development organization by measuring growth in the total lines of code (LOC) contributed by developers. We develop a software framework (NEO) that allows rapid creation of model variants representing alternative SLHs. NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as "complex adaptive hierarchical networks" (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). Modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime. Thus, NEO is a simulation framework that can be used in any domain of expertise, where systems are represented as interdependent entities that store and flux multiple currencies.

AB  - We began our journey with the goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the remaining billions. We gravitated towards providing neighborhood connectivity in developing and rural regions. Businesses saw an opportunity and local government began to value blanket city-wide coverage. But success was not inevitable. Deployments failed and critics questioned the promises. Perhaps the technology was not ready for prime time. So we began "fixing" the technology, part of which included revisiting governmental policies around spectrum allocation. The US government listened and in a landmark ruling on Nov. 4, the FCC voted to open the unused low frequency bands for unlicensed use. In this talk, the author discussed the evolution of our thinking on how to achieve open pervasive Internet connectivity. The author highlight promising new directions that are full of interesting challenges. The author discussed solutions that researchers are developing and show their trajectory. The author's objective is to present what the author believe is the new frontier of wireless networking and ubiquitous Internet, at the intersection of cognitive systems, mesh networking, and white spaces. The author challenged the audience into taking on new technical problems and thinking about new business models, which will lead us to success in our original goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the masses, bridging the digital divide, and enabling exciting new applications and services in the process.

AB  - Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.

AB  - The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.

Furthermore, an analysis using some recent categorizations for exploitation and exploration, and especially the effects of selection, sheds light on how MPS performs better in high dimensions than popular metaheuristics such as Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization.

AB  - In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS.

AB  - Advancement in wireless transmission has enabled the communication among multiple devices all over the world, as well as expanding the frontiers of wireless Internet access. As a result of these advancement, numerous devices are questing for wireless connectivity thereby congesting the existing spectrum. If new measures are not taken to reduce depletion of the reserved radio resource, new allocations of wireless Internet access will be impossible, thereby risking the development of the entire wireless ecosystem. The demands for resourceful spectrum consumption have continually driven researchers and stakeholders in the wireless industry to search for spare radio spectrum to offer affordable and reliable wireless connectivity. The TV broadcasting is not fully utilizing the spectrum in some geographical zone. These TV unused spaces called TV White Spaces (TVWS), are well-thought-out to be the probable future resolutions for unavailability of spectrum. The low frequency band (470 to 694 MHz) of the unutilized TV channel has exceptional broadcast features over extensive distances and enables transmissions through high-rise buildings, trees, and mountains. These features allow the applications of TVWS in Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor network, wireless connectivity, wireless switching, smart grid and cities, automated transportation, and logistics as well as connectivity in cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a study on the advantages and benefits of television white space as an alternative to wireless broadband connectivity.

AB  - The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are ubiquitous in our modern world, from the cars we drive to the homes we live in. CPS are integrated systems that combine computational and physical components to perform complex tasks. As CPS become increasingly sophisticated and interconnected, it is important for students to have a basic understanding of how they work and how to use them safely and responsibly.In this work, the need for CPS education, the requirements from the teaching faculty and students, the course design methodology and its intent and a 20-hour lesson plan for CPS education is proposed along with a methodology to teach an introductory module on safety and security. CPS education in pre-university education should be comprehensive and hands-on, with an interdisciplinary approach, emphasis on safety and security, real-world applications, and integration of emerging technologies. This education will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological world while being aware of the trust, safety and security aspects in designing and using the CPS interface. The proposed method was implemented in an undergraduate program as an elective course and its observations are presented.

AB  - This study seeks to develop a model that would facilitate professional skill development in aeronavigation system operators by considering the neurophysiology that underlies the formation and development of functional systems. A key role is played by motivation which is realized by electrochemical processes in synapses. We present a model of synapse formation in the process of learning. A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in optimizing cumulative rewards, and it provides policies that account for how the system will interact over the future with the agent. However, when more than one learning agents are present, developing efficient collaborations/interactions is a challenging issue; not every agent may have access to the same amount of information and computational resources; not every agent may make the same assumptions about the decision-making mechanisms of one another; and many agents may not even be aware of the existence of other agents. These cognitive and physical limitations can be seen as a form of bounded rationality. Several recent experimental and empirical studies have found that the initial responses of decision-makers in multi-player games are often far from the equilibrium, which is very often out-predicted by structural non-equilibrium (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) models. This is because non-equilibrium play models allow for players who are boundedly rational and have limited information, so that their policy is not necessarily a best response to the actual adjustment laws of other agents. This tutorial talk will present computationally and communicationally efficient approaches for decision-making in boundedly rational stochastic games. Motivated by the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose non-equilibrium strategies, two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning will be described. In the first model, named level-k thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs, and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, this tutorial talk will present both a level-recursive as well as a level-paralleled algorithm, where the latter can have an overall reduced computational complexity. For more information please see the main tutorial paper [1].

AB  - This talk introduces the recent progress and development of computational intelligence for Robots That Think (RTT). Considering the next generation of robotics [1–5], robot intelligence can be classified into six categories such as cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioural intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. The robot intelligence can be realized through intelligence technology (IT) using cognitive architecture in which computational intelligence (CI) is embedded.

AB  - A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.

AB  - Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development

AB  - We introduce the novel problem of automatically generating animated GIFs from video. GIFs are short looping video with no sound, and a perfect combination between image and video that really capture our attention. GIFs tell a story, express emotion, turn events into humorous moments, and are the new wave of photojournalism. We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual and elaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generated GIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates a ranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train our model to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over 100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectively deal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in the ranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picks up several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs. On our new large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the advantage of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Cloud computing is a widespread technology, which has attracted much attention nowadays. Among the many criteria that must be considered for data storage in the cloud, access control plays a vital role. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a well-known technique for secure data storage in the cloud. Since the traditional RBAC models are improper for open and decentralized environments, recently, some works have integrated the trust concept into the RBAC model. Nevertheless, they have not fully addressed the required security metrics of a trust-based system. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce the security goals that should be considered in an efficient trust-based system. Second, we propose a novel trust and reputation based RBAC model that not only can properly withstand the security threats of trust-based RBAC models, but also is scalable as it has reasonable execution time. Third, we evaluate the proposed model using the famous trust network of advogato dataset. Eventually, we compare the proposed model with recently-published ones in terms of mean absolute error, execution time of indirect trust computation, and provided features. The achieved results are indicative of the priority of the proposed model to be employed in real cloud environments.

AB  - Social engineering is a real threat to industries in this day and age even though the severity of it is extremely downplayed. The difficulty with social engineering attacks is mostly the ability to identify them. Social engineers target call centre employees, as they are normally underpaid, under skilled workers whom have limited knowledge about the information technology infrastructure. These workers are thus easy targets for the social engineer. This paper proposes a model which can be used by these workers to detect social engineering attacks in a call centre environment. The model is a quick and effective way to determine if the requester is trying to manipulate an individual into disclosing information to which the requester does not have authorization for.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a realistic model to investigate the cascading failure process in a cyber-physical power system (CPPS) which can be topologically modeled as an interdependent system consisting of a power network and a cyber-network. To evaluate the robustness of CPPS against cyber-attacks, we take into consideration the effects of computer malware spreading, power redistribution and overloading, and the interdependency between the coupled networks, and then adopt the stochastic failure model to calculate the time interval between the initial cyber-attack and a given level of power loss. We conduct a critical node analysis on the power network to identify the important buses whose removals are likely to trigger a serious blackout. Based on the results of the critical node analysis, we propose both deterministic and stochastic coupling strategies for an asymmetric CPPS with two subnetworks with unequal sizes, to improve its robustness against both random and intentional cyber-attacks. The simulation results on CPPSs built on IEEE 118 Bus and 300 Bus power systems indicate that the proposed coupling methods can effectively improve the system robustness against cyber-attacks.

AB  - In the turnstile ℓp heavy hitters problem with parameter ε, one must maintain a high-dimensional vector x ∈ ℝn subject to updates of the form update (i,Δ) causing the change xi ← xi + Δ, where i ε[n], Δ ∈ ℝ. Upon receiving a query, the goal is to report every "heavy hitter" i ∈ [n] with |xi| ≥ ε ∥x∥p as part of a list L ⊆ [n] of size O(1/εp), i.e. proportional to the maximum possible number of heavy hitters. For any pε(0,2] the COUNTSKETCH of [CCFC04] solves ℓp heavy hitters using O(ε-p lg n) words of space with O(lg n) update time, O(n lg n) query time to output L, and whose output after any query is correct with high probability (whp) 1 - 1/poly(n) [JST11, Section 4.4]. This space bound is optimal even in the strict turnstile model [JST11] in which it is promised that xi ≥ 0 for all i ∈ [n] at all points in the stream, but unfortunately the query time is very slow. To remedy this, the work [CM05] proposed the "dyadic trick" for the COUNTMIN sketch for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model, which to maintain whp correctness achieves suboptimal space O(ε-1lg2 n), worse update time O(lg2 n), but much better query time O(ε-1poly(lg n)). An extension to all p ∈ (0,2] appears in [KNPW11, Theorem 1], and can be obtained from [Pag13]. We show that this tradeoff between space and update time versus query time is unnecessary. We provide a new algorithm, EXPANDERSKETCH, which in the most general turnstile model achieves optimal O(ε-plog n) space, O(log n) update time, and fast O(ε-ppoly(log n)) query time, providing correctness whp. In fact, a simpler version of our algorithm for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model answers queries even faster than the "dyadic trick" by roughly a log n factor, dominating it in all regards. Our main innovation is an efficient reduction from the heavy hitters to a clustering problem in which each heavy hitter is encoded as some form of noisy spectral cluster in a much bigger graph, and the goal is to identify every cluster. Since every heavy hitter must be found, correctness requires that every cluster be found. We thus need a "cluster-preserving clustering" algorithm, that partitions the graph into clusters with the promise of not destroying any original cluster. To do this we first apply standard spectral graph partitioning, and then we use some novel combinatorial techniques to modify the cuts obtained so as to make sure that the original clusters are sufficiently preserved. Our cluster-preserving clustering may be of broader interest much beyond heavy hitters.

AB  - Several models have been developed to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, and how it could be contained with nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing restrictions and school and business closures. This article demonstrates how evolutionary AI can be used to facilitate the next step, i.e., determining most effective intervention strategies automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription, it is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact. Early experiments suggest that workplace and school restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. They also demonstrate that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and suggest creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g., by alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future pandemics.

AB  - Capturing and retaining the attention of students while learning complex topics like modeling and simulation is a critical task. In discrete-event simulation (DES), educators rely on examples like queueing systems in fast food restaurants or manufacturing organizations to provide the necessary context for learning. In many instances, these examples fall short in capturing the attention of students, especially at the middle and high school levels. One approach for learning complex topics, like creating simulations, is through gaming. This paper reports on the creative use of regular simulation tools to develop simulation games with entertainment content aimed towards engaging young learners. Two games are presented: one focuses on the use of decision nodes while the second focuses on the use of batch/separator nodes. As part of future work, we propose to use these games to evaluate how much knowledge transfers from an entertainment context to one using simulations for real-life situations.
