AB  - Video streaming technology has swiftly emerged in the field of information and technology. In comparison to traditional cable broadcasters whose content could only be watched on TVs, video streaming is ubiquitous and viewers can flexibly watch the video contents on various devices, ranging from smartphones to laptops, and large TV screens. In the Applications nowadays, content on the platform exists far in advance even before a user thinks to watch it. It can be preprocessed easily. Heavy compression techniques can be used and videos can be prepared with different qualities and transmission rates. In past some decades devices on which streaming is done have been transformed totally from televisions to OTTs which stream a large amount of content. Also, various electronic gadgets like laptops, tablets etc. provide ease to users to watch the content with portable facility. It has been noted that among all the sites browsed, streaming websites/services holds around 60% of all. The basic idea behind implementing the modules is that some content is widely available over the internet and is accessible to everyone irrespective of their age. Also, people are using these platforms as a source of entertainment for most of the time during the day which eventually leads to eye problems. Be it phone or laptop or any other device watching screen for so long in a day is not good for health.

AB  - Prof. LotfiAskarZadeh had revolutionized the field of logics by proposing a novel logic, Fuzzy Logic, in 1965 where there is smooth transition between different classes due to overlapping of membership functions, and each element in fuzzy set has a degree of membership. Fuzzy Logic was considered appropriate to represent any vague or ambiguous situation of the real life problems. It also has the provision of allowing linguistic variables whose truth values may vary between 0 and 1; in contrast to two values of classical logic. Quite recently, Neutrosophic Logic was proposed by Florentine Smarandache, which is based on non-standard analysis that was given by Abraham Robinson in 1960s. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty, vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, undefined, unknown, incompleteness, inconsistency, redundancy, and contradiction that encompasses the shortcomings of every other logic studied in the past. All the factors stated are very integral to human thinking, as it is very rare that we tend to conclude/judge in definite environments, imprecision of human systems could be due to the imperfection of knowledge that human receives (observation) from the external world. Imperfection leads to a doubt about the value of a variable, a decision to be taken or a conclusion to be drawn for the actual system. Multiple factors could lead to uncertainty like incomplete knowledge (ignorance of the totality, limited view on a system because of its complexity), stochasticity (the case of intrinsic imperfection where a typical and single value does not exist), or the acquisition errors (intrinsically imperfect observations, the quantitative errors in measures). This talk would focus on the overlapping regions of the fuzzy systems in which a method has been proposed for using neutrosophic logic and assign a triplet of the form (t, i, f) for the points that are spanned by overlapping ranges, in such a way that every such output is assigned a true, indeterminate and false value.

AB  - Sleep plays a parallel role in maintaining good health as diet and exercise. It not only improves the performance of our brain but also manages our mood swings and maintains our health. Not getting proper hours of sleep on a regular basis may become the reason for many disorders and diseases. Stress often impacts the sleep cycle of an individual resulting in a severe impact on their physical and mental health. Stress even affects the cognitive functioning of an individual, which refers to the mental processes involving memory management, decision thinking, etc. So, eventually, stress becomes a common factor for both. This study proposes an approach helping individuals to reduce stress by turning towards a proper sleep cycle eventually resulting in an increase in cognitive functioning. This paper uses the conventional method of machine learning through which it could be justified that as stress increases the number of hours slept by the person decreases. Furthermore, a correlation was established between sleep stress and cognitive functioning through which it could be concluded that sleep affects cognitive functioning. Previous research studies suggest that there is a link between video games and increased cognitive functioning, So, this study proposed the solution as a game named CANDY CRUSH which is much popular among middle age groups as it is easy to learn and can prove to be stress releaser for them eventually leading to better cognitive functioning.

AB  - Clustering is an important technology in data mining. Squeezer is one such clustering algorithm for categorical data and it is more efficient than most existing algorithms for categorical data. But Squeezer is time consuming for very large datasets which are distributed in different servers. Thus, we employ the distributed thinking to improve Squeezer and a distributed algorithm for categorical data called Coercion is proposed in this paper. In order to present detailed complexity results for Coercion, we also conduct an experimental study with standard as well as synthetic data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

AB  - Complex networks can often be characterized by a fundamental structure that can be described by general principles. The same holds for social networks of partnership formations. Connections arose from the H2020 R& D funding program can also be analysed this way that is hugely affected by endogenous impacts. Nevertheless, self-organization occurs naturally that results high preferential points, near scale-free connection-network and significant inequalities among partners, EU member states and regions. Albeit the goal of such programs is not to increase regional cohesion but to remove obstacles from a borderless knowledge transfer, the two fields are not sharply separable. The aim of the present study is to shed light on regional connections within the H2020 social network and its time evolution via investigation of graph centrality measures. Since long-term regional development also necessitates strategical thinking regarding resource allocation on innovative fields, results could also be utilized by corresponding policymakers.

AB  - LAMOST is an innovative active reflecting Schmidt telescope in combining a large aperture with a wide field of view, and releasing more than 5,000,000 spectra in DR3. A considerable part of the low SNR spectra are not released or measured parameters, some of these can improve the SNR by the method of spectra stacking. Firstly, targets are selected whose distances of latitude or longitude are less than a certain threshold value. Then, calculating direct distances of targets if distances are less than a certain threshold value, we can think that they are repeated observations of the target star. Finally, stacking observations of the target star if they have same results of wavelength calibration.

AB  - Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become popular for their versatility and flexibility in implementing various digital circuits. An FPGA-VLSI processor's effectiveness is directly proportional to the speed with which its various digital signal processing operations may be carried out. The goal of this technique is to attain both a high level of accuracy and a high rate of speed. Approximate multipliers (AP) are among the fastest multipliers that are available and are used in FPGA-VLSI systems that are based on artificial intelligence (AI). A 64-bit multiplicator can be approximated with a 64-bit number thanks to the study that was suggested. We are employing the partial product or dada based multiplication technique to implement the suggested 64 bit digital approximate multiplier. This technique allows the 64 bit multiplication operation to be completed in the partial form. 64 bits multiplied by 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 bits respectively after being broken up. We are thinking about performance characteristics like the area, the latency, and the PDP right now. The area is decreasing by up to 55%, and the latency and PDP are both decreasing by approximately up to 70% when compared to the present work. The multiplier under consideration achieves an accuracy of 99%. The virtex 7 family is represented by the FPGA integrated circuit that was used for the simulation.

AB  - Summary form only given. I will review the past and present of “education for CIVEMSA and CIVEMSA for education”, then offer a few suggestions about where their futures might lie. The evolution of computer technology and the evolution of our thinking about its role in classrooms and teaching laboratories provide a natural timeline. There is also a spatial element to consider: as with the teaching of instrumentation and measurement itself, at any particular time distinct national and regional differences are apparent, and they are fairly weakly coupled, so taking a birds-eye view we get to observe multiple experiments running in parallel. Regarding the present and the foreseeable future, I would particularly like to review recent research that shows - it seems stronger than just “suggests” - that students who take notes on laptops learn less well than students who use pen-and-paper, and from there speculate a little about the consequent implications for CIVEMSA topics.

AB  - To know and to control the data does not mean that we are in possession of the information. Thinking further, if we have information, even that doesn't mean that we have knowledge. Knowledge is power. That is why people insist and doesn't share it with others. What's more, we are trying to prevent it from getting into the wrong ears or hands. Nowadays data protection is considered to be well organized. Data storage is realized almost exclusively on IT systems. In informatics, the research experts of large background institutes work on various security solutions which, with a little delay, are transferred to regulatory systems. Throughout the review of the security of information derived from data, a gap can be observed that with the spread of the Internet and the development of the technology can cause an actual problem in the protection of the information.

I do not realize why Chung makes such a statement on page 276 as "They appear to take it for granted that one of the closest integers to no is the optimum value, when n is forced to be an integer". I think that Wu and Ouyang's algorithm is perfect and hence it is entirely unnecessary that Chung uses calculus to yield equation (6) to examine the functional behavior of the joint annual total relevant cost function with respect to n. In addition, the four comments made in this note show that there is some room for improvement in relation to algebraically solving Wu and Ouyang's model so that the pedagogical advantages of model solution and problem evaluation are more eminent.

AB  - Attractive reverberation imaging is a clinical thinking system that utilizations radio waves and a solid visual field to make explicit transmissions of tissues and organs. Examining mental development is frequently utilized. Cancer in the cerebrum is a group of cells that replicate and grow strangely. Growth is made up of unwanted cells, which may be found in different parts of the brain, for example, the skull, arteries, glial cells, neurons, lymphatic tissue or metastasize from cancers found in different organs. When in doubt, development can be characterized into two classes, for instance, undermining (cancer-causing) and innocuous (non- destructive). The disruptive proof and ID of cerebrum development is incredible for MRI to imagine, nonetheless, the drawn-out and frightening work performed by clinical experts. This paper introduces systematic brain collection of MRI and recognition using differentiation (k-implies). The recommended strategy covers several stages. The recommended technique comprises a few phases, for example, preprocessing, filtration, and wavelet changes highlight extraction division and grouping. Here, the Median sifting strategy is used to preprocess the given picture for eliminating the commotion and afterward apply DWT to remove the GLCM highlights and grouping division to track down the growth region restriction. At last, the trial result examines the capacity of the proposed calculation concerning exactness.

The present home security system needs an LCD screen that is located somewhere inside the home to view the camera video. At some point of time, consider the time when you are watching a very interesting program in the television, may be the last over of a T-20 match or the final minutes of a soccer match, your mind won't allow you to think of anything else than the ongoing match. At this circumstance, when anyone rings your door bell, naturally you won't mind that, whoever the guest may be. At another instance, if you are tired of attending unwelcomed guests n times, chances are there to neglect the guest at the n+1th time more consciously. If the guest at the door is an opportunity, it would be evidently missed. Our innovation to conquer this problem is, the video of the person standing at the door is made appeared at the television screen not by replacing the existing cable signal but as a pop up screen which covers a small portion of the TV screen. So, by noticing the pop up, one can decide which is vital - either the TV program or the guest. This pop up disappears automatically after a certain point of time when the guest leaves‥

AB  - Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a technology where light is used to transfer data. Just think of it, where light can be used as a medium of data communication and it is also a source of light (vision). How easy our work would be, the VLC technology is mostly used in indoor communication. The reason for this technology to evolve is the increasing number of crimes. In the present day, the number of internet users are more, there is no work done without the help of the internet. Due to this, the possibility of cyberattacks is more. Most of our personal data and confidential information is lost due to cyberattacks. The companies have faced a lot of financial losses because of it. The data transfer in VLC cannot be hacked easily. It is least prone for the attacks to take placeas communication is mostly indoors. In this paper, we have realized VLC in SISO and $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configurations. It is observed that the $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configuration outperforms SISO in terms of Bit error rate and Quality Factor.

AB  - This paper focuses on space-time non-linear intelligent modeling for regional data, researches how to apply back-propagation neural network (BPN) into analysis of regional data. Thinking about sectional instability of spatial pattern, this paper divided space units of researching regions into different subregions by improved K-means algorithm based on spatial adjacency relationship. Then build a space-time model with BPN. To solve the problem that deviation is too large in determining boundary of zonings by BPN model when data dimension increased, this paper bring forward a modular BPN model which named regional space-time neural network (RSTNN) model, modeling and predicting respectively based on every zoning with BPN. At last, compare the abilities of modular BPN model and global BPN model by means of analysis of an example.

AB  - Clinical Data mining as an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science is becoming increasingly important in recent years. While, so far, there is not a complete web based medical data analysis and mining platform. Weka is one of the most widely used data mining tools with a variety of algorithms integrated. However, as a workbench, it can not be integrated into specific web based business system. Also lots of defects are detected in our or other practitioner's daily usage such as preprocessing functions can't satisfy the actual needs. While the most badly shortcoming, we think, is visulization and it can not integrated into web based business system. This paper presents a web based weka in a real application scenario of exploring the relationship between blood routine examination results and fifteen common hematological diseases. As an innovative point, we combine weka with D3, this strategy not only solving the problem of implementing visualization on the web front-end but also making visualization more powerful than weka original. Also, we integrate our weka into pentaho BI.

It means thinking about quality in terms of all functions of the enterprise and is a start - to - finish process that integrates interrelated functions at all levels. The problem appears by defining the ldquototal qualityrdquo term. In this paper, quality is not only meeting customer's requirements, formal and informal, at lowest cost, first time and every time, it includes also the requirements of the environment. This requires the enlargement of traditional TQM concepts and the creation of a new model and framework for Environmentally Conscious TQM (ECTQM) where TQM is within ldquoDesign for Environmentrdquo.

This method is robust for it overcomes the problems of picture quality and shooting angle. Through the unsupervised Bayesian machine learning method, the vehicle type of unknown pictures can be recognized and fallen under the best matching type. The result shows that the vehicle rate is between 60% and 70%. When the number of feature points is between 180 and 210, we get the best result. The scale of training set is extremely important for perfecting the feature point information. Generally think, the training set is the bigger, the better.

AB  - Humans frequently communicate effectively using their faces in addition to their words. The use of computer vision techniques to categorize face emotion has been extensively studied. Given the difficulties and restrictions of databases, such as the use of static data or facial capture in artificial contexts, these have had different degrees of success. As a result, we think that novel preprocessing methods are necessary to increase the precision of facial expression detection models. In this study, we suggest a novel, yet straightforward, approach to improving the precision of face emotion identification. Our research was done using the FER2013 dataset, which includes static facial photos of 7 basic emotions. Resizing and Normalization image preprocessing techniques were applied on the dataset prior to the splitting into train and test sets. The training images were split into train and test sets in the ratios of 75% and 25% respectively. The facial expressions in the photos were classified using Convolution Neural Networks [CNNs], with an accuracy of 76.75% on the test set.

This paper analyses the principle of dividing a micro-video course content, and defines the connotation and classification of knowledge points in a micro-video course. Based on the analysis of instructional objectives, the decomposition of a micro-video course content can be implemented by the methods of classification analysis, interpretative structural modelling, and hierarchy analysis. In addition, based on analysing the type and relations of knowledge points, ontology metadata modelling of knowledge points can make the knowledge points correlate with each other, ensuring the integrity of the micro-video course content, and the reusability of the instructional micro-video with a knowledge point-based design.

AB  - In the circumstances that evidences are highly or full conflict, D-S evidence combination method may lose effectiveness, for this reason some improved methods of evidence combination are given in succession. Some scholars think, different evidence source is under different circumstance, so the importance of each evidence source is different. In the conditions that evidences are highly or full conflict, it is necessary to give weight to every evidence source, then conflict probability can only just be assigned. In this paper, we construct an evaluating standard with basic proposition and its rough combined probability value, to calculate the weight coefficient of every evidence source, based on that, conflict probability is assigned, combination of evidences is built. In this method, subjective information from decision-makers is used, and objective information from evidences is also used, only little artificial job is needed. This method can be achieved on computer easily, and satisfying consequence can be obtained.

However, mechanics is more than interlocking of these two professions; under it we understand - beside computing (informatics) and electronics - also results of control technique, artificial intelligence and their common effect that are realised in the equipment that surrounds us. In the article we show how we arrived here, through origins of evolution of individual sciences up to mechatronics that establishes integration that creates a new value.

AB  - “India's agriculture is its lifeline.” The production of agriculture depends on fertilisers. One of the main issues that farmers face is a lack of information regarding the necessary fertiliser amounts. Farmers think that when fertiliser use rises, production rises as well. This, however, is untrue since the soil just uses what it need and leaves the remainder behind. Overuse results in leaching, a decrease in the natural fertility of the soil, and other problems. A solution is to make it possible for farmers to test their soil and use fertilisers in accordance with the needs of the soil at a reasonable cost. This study describes the development of a low-cost soil nutrient detection method using pre-made capsules. Here, it is possible to do three different nutritional tests for sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. In this experiment, three test tubes are used, and after adding varied amounts of dirt and water to each, the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. After then, the tube starts to change colour. A colour sensor is used in this instance, and it recognises the colour shift in the test tubes and compares it to the information previously known about the colour deficit. The farmer is advised of the shortage and how much fertiliser is necessary to make up for it once the sensor data is analysed using Arduino.

AB  - Traditional knowledge acquisition and machine learning methods merely acquire knowledge from instances. Great amount of instances are needed for complex problems. Another problem greatly handicaps knowledge acquisition is semantic gap which is caused by lacking of knowledge about processing. Inspired by the Monte Carlo thinking and psychological facts, architecture of theories and appropriate knowledge acquisition and problem solving methods are advanced. Semantic gap and incoherence can be effectively handled with the architecture. Knowledge acquisition and problem solving can be greatly enhanced in efficiency and accuracy by implementing the architecture because of the bridging of incoherence by the theory architecture.

There is sufficient material available in early stages to take into account for security testing. Here the detailed structure of the software is available. As the requirement phase is the first phase, the detailed requirements are also available. To have a secure system it is necessary to start thinking and working on security during inception of the software development. Various dimensions have been considered and a systematic approach is given. This paper deals with the inception of the security testing and presents an approach that will be helpful for researchers who are working in the field of security testing.

AB  - Maintenance of the patient respiratory passage (airway) open and unobstructed breathing is a foremost duty of an anesthesiologist or other physicians who are involved in patient care under emergency situations. One of the main reasons for respiratory related problems is unanticipated difficult airway (unexpected difficulty in maintaining the face mask or passing an endotracheal to maintaining the continuous opening of the airway). If the doctor under duty fails to keep the airway open, it may lead to death or permanent bodily harm of patient, because of inadequate oxygenation. There is no readily available software solutions at present for predicting the exact probability of difficulty in mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Hence there is an urgent need to develop an expert system solution to support the anesthesiologists in predicting the risk and think about the remedial approaches to prevent the future consequences. The hard dealing with the advancement of a uniform categorization of patient safety has hindered the current advances in patient safety. This paper presents a prediction system to deal with difficulties in airway management using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python tools. This expert system aims to support the doctors in the case of prediction of difficult parameters of the patients associated with the airway management.

AB  - Classifying foetal health is a crucial responsibility in healthcare, and innovative machine learning techniques can be utilised to help. In this instance, K-nearest neighbour, Nave Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers are used to fine-tune an input picture dataset. The adjustment is done on these classifiers using methods like feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tweaking. Through the identification of the ideal parameters and feature combinations for your dataset, these strategies assist in improving the performance of the classifiers. To enhance the sustainable effectiveness of the classifier, you may also think about pre-processing methods like normalisation or dimensionality reduction. For the categorization of foetal health in this solution, three models are used and compared, with K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes classifier, and Decision Tree classifier showing 90%, 84.5%, and 93% accuracy, respectively when machine learning optimization techniques are applied using pre-trained model.

AB  - The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.

AB  - Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as one of the most important methods to tackle multiple criteria decision-making problems, has achieved much success over the past several decades. Given that linguistic expressions are much closer than numerical values or single linguistic terms to a human way of thinking and cognition, this paper investigates the AHP with comparative linguistic expressions. After providing the snapshot of classical AHP and its fuzzy extensions, we propose the framework of hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP, which shows how to yield a decision for qualitative decision-making problems with complex linguistic expressions. First, the comparative linguistic expressions over criteria or alternatives are transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements and then the hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) are constructed. Considering that HFLPRs may be inconsistent, we conduct consistency checking and improving processes after obtaining priorities from the HFLPRs based on a linear programming method. Regarding the consistency-improving process, we develop a new way to establish a perfectly consistent HFLPR. The procedure of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP is given in stepwise. Finally, a numerical example concerning the used-car management in a lemon market is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP method.

AB  - Self-assembling DNA complexes have been intensively studied in recent years aiming to achieve bottom-up construction of nanoscale objects. Among them a DNA complex called the DNA tile is known for its high programmability. DNA tiles can form 2-D crystals with programmable patterns via self-assembly. In order to create a wide range of complex objects by algorithmic self-assembly, we need a methodology to predict its behavior. To estimate the behavior, we can use thermodynamic simulations based on the Monte Carlo method. However, the previous simulation model assumed some simplified conditions and was not able to adequately explain the results of crystal growth experiments. Here, we propose the realistic tile assembly model, in which we are able to simulate the detailed conditions of the experimental protocols. By this model, the results of experiments (e.g., error rates, growth rate, and the formation and melting temperatures) are reproduced with high reliability. We think this model is useful to predict the behavior of DNA self-assembly and to design various types of DNA complexes.

In this experimental medium, four tasks, namely Color Combination, Arithmetic Operation, Word Formation, and Object Creation can be understood and modeled as a sophisticated translation of the spatial production systems of bubbles. Although Bubble Play has not yet been formally evaluated, its objective is that basic knowledge and skills are acquired by a player through systematic interaction with simulated spatial objects. Bubble Play promotes systems thinking by requiring players' use of visual concepts and is designed to support instruction in basic mathematics and language skills.

AB  - Domain adaptation aims to improve the performance of the classifier in the target domain by reducing the difference between the two domains. Domain shifts usually exist in both marginal distribution and conditional distribution, and their relative importance varies with datasets. Moreover, there is an influence between marginal distribution distance and conditional distribution distance. However, joint domain adaptation approaches rarely consider those. Existing dynamic distribution alignment methods require a feature discriminator, and they need to train a subdomain discriminator for each class. Besides, they don't think about the interaction between the two distribution distances. In this article, we propose a dynamic joint domain adaptation approach, namely Joint Domain Adaptation Based on Adversarial Dynamic Parameter Learning (ADPL), to deal with the above problems. Both marginal distribution alignment and conditional distribution alignment can be implemented by adversarial learning. The dynamic algorithm can keep a balance between marginal and conditional distribution alignment with only two domain discriminators. In addition, the dynamic algorithm takes the influence between the two distribution distances into consideration. Compared with several advanced domain adaptation methods on both text and image datasets, all classification experiments and extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that ADPL has higher learning performance of classification and less running time. This reveals that ADPL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

AB  - In this paper, first, relationship between bipolar-valued fuzzy set and fuzzy set with its extensions is discussed. Second, a new order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets is introduced. Contrary to the existing YinYang order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets, which focuses on the “equilibrium” monotonicity, the new proposed order relation is concerned with “preference” monotonicity. And then, some new operations and related properties about the new defined order relation are presented. Third, by combining bipolar-valued fuzzy set with the rough set theory, the concept of the bipolar-valued rough fuzzy set is developed, which is the first attempt to consider inconsistent bipolarity into rough set theory. Particularly, by introducing two new operations to the rough set theory, the widely existing information losing problem in the computation process is solved. Furthermore, parameter-related and parameter-free rough degrees about the bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in a crisp approximation space are introduced. Finally, the bipolar-valued fuzzy decision information system is given; then, both the attribute reduction method and the knowledge discovery method based on the proposed roughness degree are presented. An example is included to show the feasibility and potential of the obtained theoretical results.

We discuss previous difficulties in object perception algorithms encountered since the 1950s, and describe how NMF overcomes these difficulties. NMF mechanisms are compared to recent experimental neuroimaging observations, which have demonstrated that initial top-down signals are vague and during perception they evolve into crisp representations matching the bottom-up signals from observed objects. Neural and mathematical mechanisms are described and future research directions outlined.

AB  - Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is an effective methodology to handle unknown and imprecise information because it can assign probability into the power set. However, the process of obtaining information is a complex task, which can consider the rational, conscious, objective evaluation of utility with behavioral effects. Besides, in most cases, information can be obtained from different angles at the same time. The quantum model of mass function (QM) uses amplitude and phase angle to easily express those properties of information that can extend D-S evidence theory to the unit circle in a complex plane. Moreover, everything in nature will have its opposite, which is a kind of universality. The Bayes theorem is essentially the process of negation. However, in most cases, decisions can be made by only fully considering the known information without considering the other side of the information. Hence, considering the negation of information is a question to be investigated deeply, which can analyze information from the other point. This article proposes negation of QM by using the subtraction of vectors in the unit circle, which can degenerate into negation proposed by Yager in standard probability theory and negation proposed by Yin et al. in D-S evidence theory. Negation can provide us more information to consider the problem from both positive and negative aspects. In this article, negation can be understood information, which does not belong to event $A$, that is to say, negation can be regarded as nonmembership by using the fuzzy terms. Based on the above discussion, this article proposes the quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET), which is the novel work to consider QPFET from the point of negation. Besides, there are some numerical examples to explain the proposed method. In order to explore the applications of QPFET, this article discusses the possibility of the VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method under QPFET to handle multicriteria decision-making that enables us to capture 2-D data, considering not only amplitude but also phase angle.

AB  - In this study, a new two-stage learning based reduction approach for fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is introduced in order to reduce the number of concepts. FCM is a graphical modeling technique that follows a reasoning approach similar to the human reasoning and the decision-making process. The FCM model incorporates the available knowledge and expertise in the form of concepts and in the direction and strength of the interactions among concepts. One of the modeling problems of FCMs is that oversized FCM models suffer from interpretability problems. An oversized FCM may contain concepts that are semantically similar and affect the other concepts in a similar way. This new study introduces a two-stage model reduction approach, and both static and dynamic analyses are considered without losing essential information. In the first stage, the number of concepts is reduced by merging similar concepts into clusters, whereas in the second stage the transformation function parameters of concepts are optimized. In order to show the benefit of using the proposed reduction approach, two sets of studies are conducted. First, a huge set of synthetic FCMs are generated, and the results of these statistical analyses are presented via various tables and figures. Subsequently, suggestions to the decision makers are given. Second, experimental studies are also presented to show the decision parameters and procedure for the proposed approach. The results show that after using the concept reduction approach presented in this study, the interpretability of FCM increases with an acceptable amount of information loss in the output concepts.

AB  - Induced ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are important extensions of OWA operators and can suit more different decision environments. However, when practitioners perform induced OWA operators, they frequently do not consider the tied values in inducing information, therein lay the problem of possible non-uniqueness of aggregation results. From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness. As an example of flexibly formulating complex preferences under the proposed concepts, a novel investigators-consultants-decision maker (ICD) two-stage IOWA evaluation model is clearly proposed and illustrated.

AB  - Fuzzy knowledge representation and reasoning is one of the key research subjects of artificial intelligence with uncertainty. Currently, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) cannot describe fuzzy nondeterministic knowledge based on the variable fuzzy criterion clearly. To solve this problem, we present an extended FPN model based on the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation. First, the mechanism and the principles of the variable fuzzy criterion under qualitative mapping are introduced. The important theoretical basis of qualitative mapping is detection and integration of perceptual attribute features. Under transition degree function and the qualitative criterion transformation, the qualitative mapping better reflects the cases in which the fuzzy membership criterion is variable. Second, we use the characteristics of the qualitative mapping to propose a structure of attribute fuzzy information granule. Based on the logic operation of fuzzy information granule, we redescribe the four fuzzy production rules which are commonly used, and obtain four kinds of fuzzy qualitative judgment rules. They can explicitly express the occurrence process of transition nodes of FPNs, which strengthens the uncertain knowledge representation ability of FPNs. The new method makes it easy to construct a learning mechanism based on cognition in FPNs.

AB  - Since its inception, DNA computing has advanced to offer an extremely powerful, energy-efficient emerging technology for solving hard computational problems with its inherent massive parallelism and extremely high data density. This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers.

AB  - Mobile-edge computing (MEC) system is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing capacities at the edge of radio access network (RAN) which is close to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to promote QoS by offloading the computationally intensive tasks to the MEC server. There are many papers discuss this issue. Nevertheless, most of them just think over one-dimension resource allocation, radio resources or computation resources, and make the MEC system less effective. Hence, we consider the allocation of both radio resources and computation resources of the MEC server to increase system effectiveness. Apart from this, we take the variety of tasks' requirements into account. That is, we assume that different tasks may have different delay requirements. We formulate this problem as a cost minimization problem and design a heuristic algorithm to address it. Numerical results show that our algorithm can greatly promote QoS.

AB  - The past 20 years have seen dramatic advances in personality science, both in theory and methodology. Some of these advances reflect a natural but incremental conceptual evolution in a maturing science, but others can be attributed in part to the ever cheaper, more ubiquitous, powerful, and mobile computing. As a result, personality science in the 21st century is a fast-moving field poised to answer important questions across diverse areas, but it is also facing increasingly complex challenges related to assessing and summarizing the important features of human behavior. Computer science and engineering may hold the key to the next advances in personality science. In what is intended to serve as a complement to Vinciarelli and Mohammadi's Survey on Personality Computing , contemporary thinking and research in personality are summarized, the mounting importance of computing in personality research is highlighted, and an outline for future directions in personality computing is offered.

AB  - There are billions of Internet of things (IoT) devices connecting to the Internet and the number is increasing. As a still ongoing technology, IoT can be used in different fields, such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, retailing and logistics. IoT has been changing our world and the way we live and think. However, IoT has no uniform architecture and there are different kinds of attacks on the different layers of IoT, such as unauthorized access to tags, tag cloning, sybil attack, sinkhole attack, denial of service attack, malicious code injection, and man in middle attack. IoT devices are more vulnerable to attacks because it is simple and some security measures can not be implemented. We analyze the privacy and security challenges in the IoT and survey on the corresponding solutions to enhance the security of IoT architecture and protocol. We should focus more on the security and privacy on IoT and help to promote the development of IoT.

AB  - Sentiment analysis research mainly aims to determine the orientation of an opinionated stretch of text into positive or negative polarity. The key motivation of sentiment analysis is getting to know what consumers think about products and services by analyzing their opinions on online portals, blogs, discussion boards, reviews etc. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the information of POS-based sentiment-rich phrases in a machine-learning algorithm that determines the semantic orientation of a given text. In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features. Therefore, a feature selection method is used to select only relevant features from the feature vector. Experimental results show that the combination of prominent unigrams and bi-tagged phrases outperforms other features for sentiment classification in a movie review dataset.

AB  - Economy of Bangladesh mostly depended on agriculture. As a small country, our population is over the limit. We are also a developing country also. For national GDP growth must be to increase the production. Every year a huge amount of agricultural production losses for the crop disease. As we know most of the farmers in our country are illiterate, have no proper knowledge about the disease, that's why they cannot manually detect the disease. I think if you properly detect the disease at the early stage we can solve the issue. We develop a model that can classify leaf disease. We focus on 5 major production crops in Bangladesh. Using computer vision technique our farmer will get the benefit. We use convolutional neural networks for classifying images. An algorithm cannot properly capture the features of existing data that's why we use a pre-trained feature extraction method that is MobileNetv2. MobileNetv2 is very useful for mobile devices. The research contains the proportions of validation accuracy of 90.38%. This approach resulted in the agriculture sector that will help a farmer to classify disease from harvest. The main goal of our model is to minimize the damage of suffering plants that can help to the growth of production. By solving this issue themselves farmers can also reduce cost. Our goal is that they can cure their crop at the right time. To achieve this goal we tend to think that we should develop a way to detect the leaf disease. We collect several kinds of cucumber leaves. And then any leave can be tasted by our model. By using our model we try to reduce the leaf disease.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities for social and economic empowerment in developing countries. However, when one thinks of Africa, robotics does not spring immediately to mind as the most relevant application of AI, considering that the continent typically has high unemployment and fast-growing populations. Nevertheless, some countries in Africa have embraced robotics on the basis that it has an important role to play in their economic development. In this article, we explore this role and the ways in which Africa can best exploit the opportunities afforded by intelligent automation and robotics. It also highlights strategies to offset the threats posed by global factors, such as premature deindustrialization.

AB  - Thousands of research have been taking place to develop advanced Artificial Intelligence System which can't only perform faster but also predict better than human. But a human has some qualities which can never be gained by a machine like creativity, empathy, sensing, and critical thinking. By aggregating the best sides of both, a novel paradigm for the judicial system can be anticipated. For this purpose, we prepare a dataset both from an online survey (n=103) and interviews conducted in Bangladesh on cases related to `Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000'. We apply several machine learning algorithms to make a machine that can predict punishment like a judge and calculate both the test accuracy and the predictive power of the models to observe which algorithm performs better and stable than the others. Even human can guide machine for judging a delinquent.

AB  - The appearing of the internet brings a large amount of information, this makes searching and filtering difficult. Therefore, a kind of special data mining technique appeared, it called Recommender System. Most research of recommender system always provides the most relevant items for users or items. However, recommendations from traditional recommender system may not satisfy the new human beings because users may already know these relevant items from other information sources. We believe that there are still some unsearched but less relevant items useful for users. On the other hand, because social network has grown very quickly, we think that there are some very useful interactive information that recommender systems can use to provide recommendations. Therefore, we propose a Social Network-based Serendipity (SNS) recommender system that uses interactive information from the social network to find out which items are interesting for users but hard to discover by themselves.

AB  - Augmenting the computing capability to the distant cloud help us to envision a new computing era named as mobile cloud computing (MCC). By leveraging the cloud resources mobile user can computation time and energy benefit. However, distant cloud has several limitations such as communication delay and bandwidth make us to think for closer cloud which brings the idea of proximate cloud of cloudlet. Cloudlet has distinct advantages and is free from several limitations of distant cloud. However, limited resources of cloudlet negatively impact the cloudlet performance with the increasing number of substantial users. In this paper, we propose a framework which helps to enhance the finite resource cloudlet performance by increasing cloudlet resources. Our aim is to increase the cloudlet performance with this limited cloudlet resource and make the better user experience for the cloudlet user in mobile cloud computing. We analyze and explain the each section of the proposed framework. In addition, we also list the important features and salient advantages of Performance Enhancement Framework of Cloudlet (PEFC).

AB  - This article connects the current fascination with immersive experience to the question of embodiment and representation by avatar presence. It also references the `pictorial' and `affective' turns in theory in order to discern `what avatars want', a play on the cultural theorist W. J. T. Mitchell's ideas. We propose that `truth' or `real' has very little to do with how we feel about our avatar creations which are in effect self-portraits. Their existence reveals our desires, yearnings, fears and insecurities. The avatar is an animated, performed image which mirrors our desire to inject it with subjectivity, while at the same time thinking of it as an object. Avatar embodiment also points us to the technological sublime. Reflecting the natural sublime, we argue that the technological version is part and parcel of our relationship to self and our avatar instantiations.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive brain disease that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills to an extent that it starts affecting the daily life. It has become the most common cause of dementia among older people. The work presented in this paper evaluates the utility of image processing on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to estimate the possibility of an early detection of AD. The total brain atrophy and specifically the hippocampal atrophy are considered strong diagnostic tests for AD. T1 weighted MRIs have been used for the purpose of image processing to evaluate atrophy. The paper demonstrates the applications of several image processing techniques such as K-means clustering, wavelet transform, watershed algorithm and also a customized algorithm tailored for the specific case. It has been implemented on the open source platforms, OpenCV and Qt, which facilitates the implementation and utility of the developed product in the hospitals without requiring any proprietary software. The results obtained from the project could aid the analysis to detect AD along with correlation with the psychiatric results and could thus assist the doctors in detecting AD at an early stage. This could progressively help in understanding and treating AD.

Though, the challenge of having a clear framework to guide companies in such an AI transformation process is missing. This paper aims to investigate conceptual frameworks sued to assess AI readiness in organizations using popular existing theories and frameworks from the Information Systems (IS) discipline such as Technology-Organizations-Environment (TOE) framework, Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI), and socio-technical Design. Followed by a review of the current theories in depth and propose an extended framework that will consider the socio-technical elements based on the local context of the UAE. A mixed methods research approach is proposed to test and validate the framework and answer the research questions. The expected results from applying the proposed framework will help academics and practitioners to identify the critical factors needed to have a successful implementation of AI strategies in the UAE.

AB  - Speed breaker is a newest source of technology to renew the wastage energy of vehicle to electrical energy during the passing time through every speed braking hump. in developing countries like India and Bangladesh they were need a lot of energy because of rapidly development of infrastructures, so we need to fulfill their demands by using the alternative sources like nonconventional and renewable energy sources. In this paper we use to say about the energy harvesting by using the speed breaker mechanism. This mechanism includes the rack and pinion arrangements. Now way day's the population is thriving dramatically and the vehicles are flourishing proportional with the ascending rate of population. Ultimately the vehicles increased with the raising up the wastage of energy and in this mechanism we picks up the wastage energy for renewed it to electrical energy by thinking out of box for generation of electricity. Then the amount of electricity generation depends on the how many vehicles passed over the hump and the weight carrying of vehicles which drops on the speed breakers, so in this we got the lot's of energy to fulfill our demand in upcoming days.

Precision timing, gravity sensors and imagers, cryptography, navigation, metrology, energy harvesting and recovery, biomedical sensors and imagers, and real-time optimisers all indicate the potential for quantum technologies to provide the basis of a technological revolution. From the field of Systems Engineering emerges a focused strategy for the development cycle, enabling the existence of hugely complex products. It is through the adoption of systems thinking that the semiconductor industry has achieved massive industrial and economic impact. Quantum technologies rely on delicate, non-local and/or entangled degrees of freedom - leading to great potential, but also posing new challenges to the development of products and industries. We discuss some of the challenges and opportunities regarding the implementation of Systems Engineering and systems thinking into the quantum technologies space.

AB  - The term "personality" refers to the combination of characteristics and attributes that contribute to an individual’s distinct personality, such as thinking, emotion, and behavior. Texts on social networking sites can automatically detect an individual’s personality qualities. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset is being used in our research paper, consisting of 16 categories of postings with an amount of 8675 posts. We classified four personality traits from the input text, namely Introversion-Extroversion (I-E), Intuitions-Sensing (N-S), Feeling-Thinking (F-T), and Judging-Perceiving (J-P). We have initially adopted several preprocessing techniques to fit these text data into our proposed machine learning model. Text preprocessing methods include tokenization, word stemming, stop words deletion. After preprocessing, features like tf-idf and countvector were extracted. The model was then trained with six state-of-the-arts classifiers. After evaluating the model, it was found that the SVM outperformed all other classifiers and proved better than the other existing works also.

AB  - Cognitive radio is proposed to opportunistically access the spectrum while the licensed user is idle. As a result, spectrum sensing procedure to observe primary user's existence is vital to cognitive radio. In this paper, we propose two adaptive sequential cooperative spectrum sensing techniques in time varying channel, namely the Two Stage Sequential Energy Detector and Differential Sequential Energy Detector. By utilizing past local observations from previous sensing slots, cognitive radio nodes can aggregate the current and previously received energy values to improve the detection performance. We explore the adaptive schemes, where cognitive radio user takes in previously received energy values when it thinks that the primary user's activity remains unchanged. Simulation results show that both proposed schemes provide better detection over conventional energy detection based cooperative technique. Additionally, both proposed schemes can satisfy the IEEE 802.22 standard's requirement of 10% false alarm and 90% detection in scenario that conventional techniques can not accommodate.

AB  - Based on quotient space and granular computing theory, the image retrieval process is analyzed, and a multi-granular method based on quotient space is proposed for Thangka image retrieval. With the proposed method, an image is divided into different granularities based on hierarchical thinking, and different quotient spaces are constituted according to different behaviors under different granularities of the image. The synthetic features are obtained by composing the attribute functions at different granularity levels based on the theory of composing multi-granularity attribute functions in the quotient space. Finally, the images are retrieved by the synthetic method. The experiment showed that the synthetic method could be able to effectively retrieve Thangka images.

AB  - Group authentication is a valid scheme to make sure whether all participants belong to the same group. For nonmembers, detecting and identifying them is also necessary. So an optimized group authentication which can detect and identify the nonmembers is proposed in this paper. The group authentication is designed for group-oriented applications. A lot of user authentication schemes only support one-to-one principle of authentication. However, network applications are no longer one-to-one communication, multiple users may be involved. So the scheme proposed a many-to-many communication. The scheme is based on Shamir's (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme. The threshold scheme can protect a secret with high security and reliability when all the participants are honest. If some dishonest participants exist, the other honest participants may obtain a false secret which will lead to a false authentication, making them think all the participants are in the same group. It can reveal the content of the communication between them. We improve the t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme, where t is the threshold of the scheme, m is the number of participants in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group. We choose a one-way function and then compute a parameter value which we will mention below. Which involve in a method to detect and identify the nonmembers in the group.

AB  - Don't panic if you look for your computer today and can't find it. We have it on the authority of technology maven Ray Kurzweil that this year computers will have vanished because of miniaturization. As he said at the TED conference in February 2005: "By 2010 computers will disappear. They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment. Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities." If you have a different impression of the world today, Kurzweil would want you to know that he is technically correct. If the rest of the world fails to think that's enough, the rest of the world is wrong.

To monitor how the drug could affect the human brain, mental arithmetic is performed, and the EEG signals are recorded. In this study, addition task performance men show that some subjects have different counting accuracy. Mental arithmetic was monitored by International 10/20 system EEG with 19 scalp electrodes. The raw EEG data was processed and plotted to 2d mapping based on the power spectrum. The spectrum changes seen in Brain mapping, show how the mental arithmetic process takes place. The results of brain mapping can be a parameter that indicates the calculation process so that it can show the quality of the brain's work. Independent component label classifier performed, subject 7 obtain 79,8%, subject12 obtain 94,3%, subject15 obtain 92,3% accuracy as brain label.

AB  - This is a Work-in-Progress Innovative Practice paper. This paper introduces a multidimensional model of cognition and an application programming interface (API) for an intelligent learning system, which we will refer to as Archimedes, that implements the first two components of the model of cognition into a web application. The model of cognition currently includes five components thinking processes, organizational strategy, design cohesion, skill mastery, and path of program development. Together these components seek to support six strategies of metacognition, metacognitive scaffolding, reflective prompts, self-assessment, self-questioning, self-directed learning, and graphic organizers. This paper focuses on the implementation and integration of the first two components of the model, thinking processes and organizational strategies into a web application. Together these components integrate Writing-To-Learn and literate programming paradigms to allow the Archimedes application to assess introductory programming students' current level of metacognition and provide automated feedback and allow them to self-monitor, self-assess and improve self-efficacy through the development of strategic knowledge for solving real-world programming problems.

AB  - Virtualization is very important factor to reduce cost of data warehouse deployment. It can reduce cost as well as tremendous pressure of managing devices, storage servers, application models and man power. In current era, data warehouse is very effective concept that can make huge impact in organizational decision support system. Unlike database systems, data warehouse systems take large amount of time and cost to deploy and develop in-house system for an organization. This is the reason that people now think about cloud computing as a solution of the problem instead of implementing their own data warehouse system. This paper is about, how cloud computing environment can be established as an alternative of data warehouse system. It will also throw some light about better environment choice for the organizational need. Organizational data warehouse and EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) are discussed with different parameters like ROI, security, scalability, robustness of data, maintenance of system etc. Paper will help in comparative analysis of both the systems.

AB  - Cloud Data Centers are becoming a more and more important reality nowadays, as more and more services are being offered in the form of Cloud resources. In order to accommodate as many requests as possible, Data Centers typically deploy oversubscription, which requires a thoughtfully calibrated usage of the computing and network resources of the system. We especially need to re-think the usage of network resources, as the kinds of demands from applications we see today have more stringent network requirements than in the past. The Software-Defined Network paradigm offers new tools to manage the network in agile, flexible ways, according to specific needs. It enables to build new customized functions in order, for example, to monitor the instantaneous load of traffic, slice the network, route each flow according to specific policies that can be modified accordingly with the needs of the system. In this paper we present an orchestrator for Software-Defined Data Center, and the strategies used to allocate Virtual Machines, basing our decisions on the current state of the system.

AB  - At present, landscape design teaching in design art education has received much attention. With the continuous development of social economy, science and technology and information network technology, traditional landscape design has also achieved a "quality" leap. The appropriate use of computer-aided software in landscape design has become an essential skill for landscape designers. Computer-aided software is like a pen in your hand, a tool that shows the designer's ideas and thinking. How to make students master computer-aided design software and use it reasonably in landscape design is a problem that current landscape design teachers need to think about and study. The existing CAD software for garden landscapes has limited expression of 3D models and virtual simulation effects, and can only be used for 2D construction drawing. In order to solve the dynamic landscape characteristics, a three-dimensional landscape design simulation system of virtual reality technology was developed. Object-oriented parametric 3D solid modeling method was used to realize 3D solid modeling, 3D real-time virtual rendering of design scenes, renderings and animations. Production, construction drawing and other functions, and explored the system computing principles, implementation methods and OpenGL extensions and other related technologies. Then the overall function of the system is briefly introduced, and the simulation process in the professional module is discussed in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is verified by an engineering example.

AB  - All the youngsters, nowadays, are not keen to developing their knowledge. Moreover, the students are easily addicted to mobile phones. So, the performance level decreases and reduces their thinking ability as well technology has grown, all the answers are now available in the internet. If they search since the internet, they get their answers directly but without knowing the base from how it came. Therefore, everyone is trying to reach the upcoming technologies without strong in their basics. Hence, a model is created with the help of toolkit (like courseware, etc.) where the technology behind this is AI. This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.

AB  - Reliable protection and reasonable control run an important role in grid connected PV power generation system. The detection and calculation of real and reactive power are the bases of many inverter resident passive and active islanding detection method (IDM). As well as the detection and calculation of real and reactive power also concern with the inverter control of grid connected PV power generation system. In this paper, considering instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current are periodic function about time, think of it in terms of periodic function space to define the inner product and norm, Hilbert space based power theory is proposed. Real power, reactive power and apparent power in Hilbert space based theory are defined. This proposed Hilbert space based power theory provide a novel view for the protection, islanding detection and control of grid connected PV power generation system.

AB  - I'm always delighted to discover a connection between two ideas that I'm already fond of on their own, so I'd like to share a connection I found recently. The first idea is writing code that expresses my thinking about the problem domain, and the second is the principle of least expressiveness (PLE). The connection is that I can use the PLE to reveal my thinking about the problem domain, and because all ambiguity stops at the code, the act of programming using the PLE can help me simplify and debug the flawed ideas I have in my head.

AB  - A technique called "Low-Cost Computing" has been attracting public attention in recent years. "Low-Cost Computing" is a method aimed at achieving the same level of performance of expensive commercial equipment or dedicated equipment by combining common, inexpensive equipment, software and services. One example of "Low-Cost Computing" is "virtual currency". Virtual currency often uses "distributed network" as an underlying technology. In a distributed network, data is stored using users' computers rather than a server for centralized data management. In short, virtual currency is realized by using the network to combine the users' computers. We think of this as "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing". There are many services using "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing", and they are becoming the mainstream of modern computers. As opposed to this, we propose "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" in this research. "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" proposed in this research means "combining commonly available devices and software to propose an environment for teleconference or remote class, and building an infrastructure with equivalent functionality to expensive systems or services". In this research, as the first step of this method, we aim to construct, with "Low-Cost Computing", a low-cost remote class environment which anyone can use. In this paper, we constructed a remote class environment with "Low-Cost Computing", and held classes at Toyo University. At the end of the remote class session, we conducted a survey on the remote class constructed in this research. Based on the survey results, we will summarize and consider the evaluation of remote class environment made available through "Low-Cost Computing".

As a result, we are examining IA's capacity to control and manage COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and other emerging pandemics. Using COVID-19 or Coronavirus and Artificial Intelligence or AI keywords, the material may be quickly found in the PubMed database. COVID-19 AI's existing understanding was analyzed to see how it may be used to increase COVID-19 AI's overall usefulness. Seven COVID-19 pandemic-related AI applications have been documented. The technology has the potential to locate the infection, track it through the system, and make forecasts about when the virus will infiltrate the whole system again. Decision-making tools are desperately needed to help combat this outbreak and allow healthcare institutions to gather enough information in real time to halt its spread. The primary objective of AI is to mimic human thinking using an expert methodology. COVID-19 vaccination production may also play a critical part in making sense of and advocating a similar project. This kind of technology is helpful in screening because of its emphasis on discoveries.

This paper introduces the similarity calculation method based on shallow Information, based on the similarity of part of speech, and also analyzes their calculation principles and calculation methods. Their advantages and disadvantages are given. At the same time, it puts forward the idea of using deep learning thinking to automatically learn the essential information of data from large-scale text data. Using the word2vec model, sentence processing is reduced to word vectors. It also proposes a method for calculating the similarity of shallow features, parts of speech features, and features of word vectors. The experimental results show that compared with the conventional method, the accuracy of the algorithm in calculating the sentence similarity is higher.

AB  - Divide-and-Conquer (DC) approach is a classical well-adopted paradigm for designing algorithms. In current big data scenarios, processing of voluminous and variety of data is required. One of the characteristics is, large-dimensional data that needs to be analyzed; for example, high resolution images used in social media are used for sentiment analysis. Our research is oriented towards discovering approaches where stage-by-stage processing is done to bring out most salient features from high-dimensional data. However, we observe that data block processing, in most of the conventional approaches, does not scale well for higher dimensionality. Instead, we think of making blocks along the feature set and we propose a divide-and-conquer based feature extraction framework based on feature set partitioning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using various feature set partitioning based PCA approaches.

AB  - Geometry is one of the oldest branches of science in mathematics that studies the shape of fields and spaces applied by architects and building technicians. Studying geometry provides many basic skills and helps to build thinking skills in analytical reasoning and problem-solving logic. Geometry is useful for understanding space in a real-life that helps in understanding better concepts. With the help of Smartphones as an information technology tool, today can simplify the calculation of a flat build. In this study will be presented the use of computer vision to calculate several types of flat shapes. The automatic calculation of the flat shape formula becomes a solution to calculate quickly to correct the answers to mathematical questions about regular or irregular flat shapes. The calculation process is done by detecting a flat shape that is taken using a Smartphone camera. Once detected, the image is converted into a binary image. Then the measurement of each pixel in the object image is measured, then the formula to be used and the calculation are processed by the application submitted. This study will utilize the Chain Code technique as a digital image processing which functions to generate codes in the form of several numbers based on the direction of the wind. This chain code can represent curves, lines, or contours of a field, determine circumference and area, and can determine the form factor of an object. From this method, it is used to detect objects and then scaling the size of objects so that the formula of the flat building that will be identified can be applied. The results showed that the detection of 2-dimensional objects was quite accurate with a percentage of 57.57% of 33 tests, and with 3 models of variation testing.

AB  - Granular computing is not only a computing model for computer-centered problem solving, but also a thinking way for human-centered problem solving. Some authors have presented the structures of such kind models and investigated various perspectives of granular computing from different application points of views. Theory of quotient space is a new granule computing tool. In order to solve the difficult problem using theory of quotient space, the original universe of discourse space X will be turned into the new granular universe[X]. The process actually implies the idea of extenics. Extension method is mainly used to solve contradictory problems by transformations of matter-elements. So we integrate extension method with theory of quotient space to solve some complicated problems in artificial intelligence system, and set up an extension-based quotient space computing model. It provides a good scheme to find feasible approximate solutions in the problem space and realize relations and transformations between granule and granule in the whole granular worlds. And it also provides a new method for solving difficult problem. So it has great theory significance and practical value.

AB  - Since years the Surge Protective Devices (SPD) are widely used to protect the sensitive equipment connected to the AC distribution network against lightning or switching surge voltages. The international standards for SPDs are now widely spread and make the new generation of AC surge protectors more efficient and more secure. But an important issue is not really described on the standards and even on the related guides for surge protection application: what is the real influence of the AC surge protector on the AC network, especially during their operation? As we know, the Power Quality (PQ) is a key point for the process continuity, the safety and even for the life expectancy of the sensitive devices connected to the AC distribution network: during their operation on surges, the surge protectors could generate some phenomena which could create disturbances or troubles on the AC network. Because the AC surge protectors are from different technologies and because the AC networks could have several configurations, many cases are possible, even the worse... Market analysis shows sometimes a low confidence of the end user in the surge protection, not because he thinks it is not efficient, but because he supposes the use of SPD could bring extra disturbances on his installation. For this reason, an in depth information about the real interaction would be useful.

AB  - Deployment of server virtualization almost becomes a universal basic concept of making full use of the data center resources. With the evolution trend for powerful multi-core servers, more memory capacity, and greater bandwidth network channel, it is necessary to think about the network I/O. To contribute this issue, Ezilla has been developed by Pervasive Computing Team at National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC). Ezilla integrates the Cloud middleware, virtualization technology, and Web-based Operating System (WebOS) to build virtual machines in the distributed computing environment. The main character of Ezilla is simplifying a lot complexity of utilizing Clouds. Via the Ezilla with SR-IOV feature, Cloud users can create virtual clusters that are customized to meet the specific needs from the users. Our goal is to make scientists or users painlessly run their works on Clouds, and greatly improve the network I/O performance.

AB  - The use of graphics in Industry is something completely normal as used to be in education, something different is the way we can apply the concepts. The idea of this document is to show the ways we think industrial graphical systems can be applied in education to increase the way students can learn some kind of skills. In the industry graphic systems show the ways in which the systems are working and operating displays of DCS (Distributed Control System) displays operational information in 2D, 2.5 or 3D environments. Educational graphics are being used to show tales, math, physical or other objects in 2D, this limits the full awareness situation of the things that can be showed to students. To enhance the characteristics of educational graphics we propose the use of some industrial tricks to increase the students' attention and understanding of situations. We think that this increases the amount and quality of information that may be given to students and prevents unnecessary time consuming in explanations.

AB  - Cloud is changing the way IT thinks and works, it's changing the way administrators do their job, the way businesses offer their services, how consultants create new offerings and solutions, and how management divide capital and operational expenses. Most of the administrators are reluctant to use cloud services because of the fear that the Cloud will make them obsolete. The rest of them, including the management have a dilemma whether to use it or not, and most important whether they are allowed to do it, based on local and global laws and regulatory compliances. This paper will deal with dilemmas administrators, consultants and management may encounter during the transition to the cloud solution, from the technical, through business, to the regulatory and legal perspective. It will give an overview on Croatian laws and rules created by Croatian regulatory bodies, which will help to solve this dilemma and make the transition to the cloud solution easier and smoother for most of the businesses that are having abovementioned dilemma.

AB  - With the development of Internet and computation technique, many areas begin to process their own area data more accurately. Especially, oil field area involves many disciplinary area data, such as physical geography disciplinary, geological disciplinary, reservoir engineering disciplinary and so on, data from simple character type to complex bulk data volume type. How to effectively manage these distributed data is always a hot potato for the oil field companies, recently, many oil companies begin to construct their own data center, however, only some topic data for research is stored in data center, it does not implement real uniform data management. Data grid technique is proposed for solving these issues, it regards data management issues as service management, and it solves data management issues puzzled people. According to these facts, a digital oil field framework based on data grid technique is proposed. We think this framework is able to solve oil field data management issues and provide all kinds of users with interested data.

AB  - Provision of reliable traffic data could cause a reduction of the traffic problem. In a previous paper, the authors developed the core of RIMAC, an information system that allows the introduction of new and reliable sources of information from camcorders, traffic lights or mobile phones. With these new data sources, RIMAC is able to provide many more realistic reports. This paper describes the development of the second part of the project: the interconnection of the core with a source of information: a camera network. In order to avoid congestion or loss of data packets, thinking of non-optical fiber networks, speed reports will be sent to the RIMAC core instead of unprocessed images. In situ, at each camera node, speed calculation is done using a C++ computer vision application and the OpenCV's Libraries over an SBC (Single Board Computer) Raspberry Pi2 with a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) camera. The first testbed was done in a few streets of Lima, an emerging South American city where live about 10 million people. Lima is beginning a long-term transportation reform plan, activists are pushing for introducing the right paradigms of citizenship and appropriate technology, like RIMAC, into the plan.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing (UBICOMP) is a term used for human interaction with computers in virtually everything we do and almost everywhere we go. It is embedding computers in our daily lives to create an active and intelligent environment [1]. This is future phase of computers, which is beyond the desktop and notebook environment, where we are currently in and we are progressively heading deeper inside this new phase. In Ubiquitous Computing we mainly focus on computer being integral part of human such that we are unaware of their presence. Computer scientists are focusing hard on ways how the interaction between human and computer can be simplified. We can think of an era where we are surrounded with over hundreds of computers each doing a unique task irrespective of location and time and keeping human unaware. In this article we explore about the evolution of ubiquitous computing from its origin and history, its architecture, role of privacy and integration of privacy in system design, its Features and Technical Challenges. Ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, which has begun just now. Ubicomp is a field where we require considerable efforts to match up the current technological developments. According to the view of Computer Scientists and Engineers in future we will be having such a technological advancement in this field that will amaze the world.
