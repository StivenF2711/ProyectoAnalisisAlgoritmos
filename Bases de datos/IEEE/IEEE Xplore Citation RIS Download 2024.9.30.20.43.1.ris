AB  - The fermentation process refers to the reaction process in which specialized metabolites are produced and accumulated in large quantities through the growth, culture and chemical changes of microorganisms (or animal and plant cells). The biomass parameters play a key role, and they cannot be detected online. Measurement technology offers a solution. Expert system technology can solve the problems of complicated fermentation process classification and numerous mechanism models in the process of biomass soft sensing modeling. This paper presents the structure of an expert system for biomass detection in fermentation process. This expert system provides a new technical method for the division of soft-sensing hybrid models.

AB  - The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \%$.

AB  - Digitization technology refers to the processing and storage of information by computer language, which includes words, graphics, colors, relationships, etc. The digitized information is stored and calculated, and displayed again in different forms. Most of the existing clothing design software is a subsystem of clothing CAD system, and its design method is mainly to use the mouse to replace the paintbrush or to use graphics processing software to process clothing photos, which lacks professional advantages and poor practicability. At present, in view of the disadvantages of most fashion design softwares, which focus on simple list of styles and interactive drawing functions, we put forward a digital fashion design system. The garment style can be automatically generated according to the user's requirements for garment style, material and color, and can be adjusted for style change, part increase or decrease, movement and part size modification. At present, the digitization of the garment field has participated in the whole process of garment industry production: anthropometry, garment fashion trend prediction, style design, model design, push version, code release, garment production, production management, process management, e-commerce, garment marketing, customer information management, etc.

AB  - Educational simulations can be useful for visualization of abstract and complex concepts and semiconductor physics seems ideal for this type of instructional support. The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.

AB  - Creating background music based on vocal sounds using deep learning is challenging. The task involves multiple input and multiple output cases that require lengthy input and output as data. However, training the models with raw data using low-end computers is expensive since training takes a long time and requires high memory. Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.

On this purpose we built a complex algorithm and computer application, and we made the configuration of the analyzed system. We exemplified the analysis algorithm for the study case of the power electric protection system-SP for the example of the very used radial distribution and curled distribution. The paper exemplifies the critical analysis of the faults including abnormal workings. The most important power elements need the risk analysis, and its random events adopt with success the Fuzzy logic which is added to the Event Tree method. This allows us to build the realistic model performance-dependability, so important technical operational Risk results are computed.

AB  - Optimization framework of digital online model for vocal music training based on computer data perception and fusion is studied in the paper. Usually, the training in pattern recognition refers to statistical learning, that is, it requires a large number of training examples to obtain the estimated values of the parameters in the model, while the high-level voice semantic training is based on example learning. With the mentioned models, the signal fusion ideas are considered. With the development of general communication technology, audio AGC technology has also developed from analog circuits to the era of the digital signal processing. With these ideas, the digital online model for vocal music training will be then considered as the novel understanding model. Through the simulation, the framework of digital online model for vocal music training is tested and validated.

AB  - Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.

AB  - Due to the fast development in computer science new modules and specializations have to be developed, and the Computer Science (CS) curriculum needs to be reshaped in order to include 21st century skills such as problem-solving, creativity, innovation, communication and collaboration. This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.

AB  - There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to address issues related to students' slow writing skills by incorporating the “Out of Eden Walk” project using an AI model. Employing a project-based learning approach, our goal was to enhance students' writing abilities, particularly in the English subject. The research was conducted as a part of the classroom term-end assessment, following the model established by Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology, involving 42 students from Class 11. We utilized a qualitative descriptive method, employing both test and non-test instruments, including observation and data analysis in six cycles. The initial student completion rate was only 11.42%, while the experimental group showed a significant improvement to 85.71% by the end of the study. National Geographic's Out of Eden Walk, led by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, serves as an exemplary illustration of slow journalism. Over a seven-year, around-the-world journey, this article explores how Salopek's Walk not only embodies the essence of slow journalism but also significantly contributed to enhancing students' writing skills through the integration of an AI model.

In other words, complicated images and drawings that require much calculation became possible and easy due to the speeding up of computer processing. However this alone cannot broaden the variety of expressivity of visual expression by a computer we need to extend its ability. The "Multi Modification Design Model" proposed by the authors, does not take so-called CG, technology and explores a, new visual expression by a computer, with a totally different approach.

AB  - In order to maintain a sustainable development in this dynamic plight of current world financial crisis, a firm must make marketing innovation as one of the core topics. However, the theoretical system of marketing innovation neither has yet entered the field of innovative research nor formed its own system because it is still mainly in the period of practicing both at home and abroad. Therefore, marketing innovation has become a new field of marketing research. In this paper, the author firstly reviews and analyzes the latest literature of marketing innovation and then reconstructs it from the perspective of strategic value innovation. By combining with the practice of marketing innovation both at home and abroad, the author puts forward structured marketing innovation paradigm.

AB  - Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions through modal features such as acoustic, text, and visual modalities. Although existing multimodal emotion recognition algorithms have achieved good performance, in many tasks, features are extracted from the same video for acoustic, text, and visual modalities, which will lead to redundant information across modalities. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms. Ablation experiments show that the input sequence of modality affects the model's performance, with the model achieving optimal performance when the input sequence is visual features, speech features, text features, and personality features.

This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies. Results showed that the Qwen-VL-Mediacal model achieved a Rouge-1 score of 0.6147, indicating its potential for medical applications. However, challenges remain, such as understanding complex scenes and abstract concepts. Future research will aim to improve the model's adaptability and reasoning capabilities.

AB  - With the continuous development of modern information technology, English learning methods and approaches are gradually diversified, especially the English electronic dictionary, which makes English learning easier. The quality of translation is an important criterion to measure the results of English interpret, which is mainly characterized by errors in translation characters or spelling, inconsistent expression, lexical and grammatical errors, etc. At present, the most advanced machine translation method, the so-called phrase-based model, is only limited to the mapping of small text blocks. Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation. Based on modern intelligent identification technology, this paper studies the development of English intelligent proofreading system, grasps the user's behavior data through behavior log, and optimizes the system. The software part of the system PP. adopts the computer intelligent proofreading method based on the improved phrase translation model to find the correct words to replace the words to be proofread and realize the intelligent proofreading of English interpret.

AB  - Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges for primary and secondary teacher capacity development. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher’ s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.

AB  - The demand for well-trained nursing professionals is ever-increasing, necessitating efficient placement processes post-graduation. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of balancing model performance with interpretability. Further research and implementation efforts are warranted to refine predictive modeling approaches and seamlessly integrate them into nursing education and workforce management practices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nursing practice and patient care delivery.

AB  - The artificial intelligence algorithm Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is excellent in creating works that simulate human output. As a result, many researchers have created impressive and satisfying art pieces such as images of non-existent people or expressive paintings. The Hijazi heritage is full of unique art forms, including the Rawashin that adorn Hijazi buildings. With the remarkable technical progress of recent years, it has become necessary to highlight this identity in a contemporary way. This work aims to exploit and explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence techniques and GAN networks in creating and producing innovative new shapes with regard to Rawashin (wooden windows). The aim is to integrate such shapes with Arabic lettering in order to produce unprecedented designs in terms of Hijazi buildings. This is done by training the machine using a dataset consisting of images of different building shapes containing Rawashin and some Arabic calligraphy using two types of GAN models. As a result, the model was able to learn and produce a new style of Rawashin.

AB  - At present, the interior design computer effect drawing is divided into two ways. The first is the ubiquitous multi-software production scheme. The scheme uses two-dimensional software autoCAD or CAD software to provide basic drawing information, and then uses three-dimensional software 3 DMANX to make three-dimensional drawings. In addition, the model is rendered by VARY Tenderer. Finally, the overall modeling effect is rendered by PS technology. Although this scheme is a widely chosen production process for producers, there are still unreasonable problems, including size, modeling sequence, modeling test and mapping efficiency. The second is the CASD software developed by the Chinese Academy of Architectural Sciences, which has the characteristics of super integration and precision, and is more efficient and practical than the previous production process. Therefore, this paper will optimize and improve the two cartographic schemes in the above market.

AB  - The four quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement, tunneling, and annealing are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with classical computers. These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different “realities” in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power.

AB  - When we build systems to operate in hazardous or remote environments, and especially when we expect them to cooperate with others in support of a goal, we rely on them to operate as correctly as possible in the (unpredicted, frequently unpredictable) situations they encounter. But the environment does whatever it does; we have essentially no control and only limited knowledge of what it does, and only the most meager notion of what it will do. In this paper, we describe an architecture for these component systems that we think will be better suited to the vagaries of environmental behavior than others. We advocate a collection of subsidiary systems to operate in parallel with the main system, to act as “outriggers” for unexpected environmental behaviors or system failures, or as “training wheels” during development.. We describe our initial notions of how they relate to the original system and how to implement them.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents the effects of our weeklong Professional Development class on the programming skills of nineteen high school teachers, their confidence in programming, and their confidence for teaching programming. A primary objective of the CS10K and CS For All initiatives is the education of K-12 teachers in aspects of computer science and computational thinking so they can teach CS courses in their schools. Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings.

AB  - Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.

AB  - Online social networks (OSNs) have become so popular that it has changed the Internet to a more collaborative environment. Now, a third of the world's population participates in OSNs, forming communities, and producing and consuming media in different ways. The recent boom of artificial intelligence technologies provides new opportunities to help improve the processing and mining of social data. In this article, an algorithm that can detect communities in the OSNs using the concepts of granular computing in rough sets is proposed. In this information model, a social network as a rough set granular social network (RGSN) is modeled. A new community detection algorithm named granular-based community detection (GBCD) is implemented. This article also defines and uses two measures, namely, a granular community factor and an object community factor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four real-world data sets as well as computer-generated data sets. The model is compared with other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for the values of modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Omega index, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-measure. The cumulative performance of the GBCD algorithm is found to be 3.99, which outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

AB  - The pandemic caused by Covid-19 – Coronavirus forced government authorities to take quick action against the virus, within the framework of these measures, borders, social distancing, confinement, cancellation of face-to-face attendance and implementation of teleworking were interrupted, and effective solutions were sought for the protection of physical health and care of life. However, mental health was neglected, triggering depression, anxiety, different types of violence, suicidal ideation, and action, among other factors. Directly affecting individuals in their environment, emotions, and perceptions. With the understanding of the demands in mental health care, the research team made an interdisciplinary proposal focused on the inhabitants of the department of Cauca, methodologically used a mixed research approach, applying qualitative instruments such as focus groups, debates with experts, discursive analysis; in quantitative, analysis of secondary sources, compilation, and review of reports. As a result, a technological platform was built to favor decision-making by state actors, a virtual learning object, a training process for 210 actors such as technical assistance, installed capacity in the 42 Municipalities of Cauca, a base document for the formulation of public policies in mental health and primary care for 60,000 people through face-to-face visits or teleorientation.

AB  - Suicide is a very critical and important issue in modern society. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for college and high school students. Social media allows students in the digital environment to share their suicidal ideas and thoughts with others. Accurate and early detection and prevention of suicidal ideation in students can save the students' lives. To identify the risk factor for suicidal attempts, a suitable method of analysing the suicidal behaviour of students using their sentiment text posted on social media can be used. This paper presents an optimized Dragonfly algorithm (DFA) using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the automatic detection of suicidal ideation in students. In our CyberHelp Solution, the proposed DFA-based DBN model analyses student social media data, predicts suicidal behavior, and treats students appropriately. The sentiment analysis performs automated categorization of online messages and makes accurate predictions of the student’s suicidal behaviors. The dragonfly heuristic optimization algorithm is used for tuning the hyperparameter in the deep belief network. The proposed DFA-DBN technique has been implemented to predict suicidal ideation in students with a higher accuracy of 95.5% compared with other classification models.

Moreover, these methods are currently widely used in different industry areas. The data mining algorithms can generate different solutions for the same data, which motivates scientists to improve it. The main goal of mining methods is to search for existing structures, patterns, and features in the collected data. Historical data from various sources make it possible to model complex processes in energy generation in renewable energy sources such as solar helio collectors and biogas plants, automate the process of interpreting geophysical data, and assess soil salinity using remote sensing data.

AB  - Everyone has a distinct handwriting style, even identical twins who share the same genes. This distinctiveness has allowed researchers to develop systems that can classify the writer's traits, including gender, age, handedness, and others. A gender classification system, for instance, classifies handwriting patterns to predict the writer's gender. With the advancement of deep learning, it is now possible to automatically extract features from the document and classify them. In this paper, two gender classification models based on Alex-Net and LeNet-5 CNN were proposed, trained, and tested on a private Urdu handwriting dataset containing 284,000 pre-segmented characters from 200 males and 200 females. The proposed models achieved state-of- the-art performance compared to existing deep learning models for gender classification. The Alex-Net model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.14%, while the LeNet-5 model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.55%.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOD) has emerged as a significant health concern in India, with prevalence rates reported between 9% to 36%. However, societal stigmas and misconceptions hinder the timely recognition and diagnosis of PCOD. A multi-modal AI-based framework for PCOD Detection and Risk Assessment is presented considering algorithms that include SVM, CNN, KNN, Otsu, and Näıve Bayes. This work integrates both image and numerical data utilizing ultrasound images, blood test results, and various patient parameters. 12 key parameters: height, weight, BMI, FSH, TSH, LH, AMH, PRL, Vitamin D3, progesterone, and RBS are considered. We conducted a survey involving 81 participants. Our survey revealed that 45% of participants were unaware of their PCOD status despite exhibiting symptoms, and 73% of participants exhibited symptoms of PCOD. 19.8% of respondents confirmed PCOD diagnoses. Our framework enhances diagnostic precision but also mitigates the emotional toll wrought by PCOD through early intervention and support.

AB  - Learning progress is fascinating, especially in STEM fields. When learning novel concepts and principles, the learners will try to link and compare the newly learned contents with their existing knowledge system. If the newly learned knowledge matches the built-up ones, the learners will easily merge it into their long-term (permanent) knowledge structure. When the newly learned knowledge does not match their existing structure, the learners feel confused and hard to accept and digest. In many cases, the learners learned similar concepts and principles from middle school to post-college at different levels, in mathematics and engineering mechanics. Learners might notice that some of the concepts and principles at different levels looked similar and plausible, but the critical differences didn't catch enough attention, neither the concepts themselves nor the application conditions. Even though the students heard the explanation from the instructors in the class, it does not match their existing daily life experience, which makes it harder to accept and merge it into their knowledge system. In other words, a puzzle piece was put in the blank position where it does not fit. The present study is working on rebuilding the STEM knowledge structures and exploring the differences that existed among high school students (9th- 12th graders), first-year engineering undergraduates, higher-level engineering students, and professional engineers with designed quantitative and qualitative research methods. This research aims to explore the possibility of making the transition smoother from one learning stage to another and develop a novel curriculum that could merge the knowledge structures in a new way to reduce or eliminate the gaps between different levels of STEM learning. The author of the present project was working with 9th-12th grade students from local high schools, and college students in STEM majors at a public university, to rebuild and figure out the differences in their knowledge structures for STEM learning. The project includes preparation work as the development of concept inventories in STEM fields, structured survey questionnaires for both experimental groups. The topics the author chose are concepts shared and inherited from high school STEM education, such as force, velocity, acceleration, Newton's Second Law, etc. Currently, the study focused on the feedback of their scores completing the concept inventories, while the next phase of intervention will be applied.

AB  - Number of networks and their sizes in terms of connected devices are increasing very rapidly. These devices are producing massive amount of raw data for different progressive purposes that need to be processed and stored somewhere. Local data storage and complete processing of massive data will not be possible by resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) enabling devices anymore in the future. Therefore, there is a need of data storage and processing capabilities to meet the desired goals of applications. Cloud computing and edge computing are the possible solution to circumvent limited data storage and computation issues of IoT devices. This paper presents a comparative study of popular architectures in which IoT devices are integrated with cloud. For this purpose, various IoT and Cloud of Things (CoT) architectures have been studied. Strengths and weaknesses of the studied IoT and CoT architectures are comprehensively analyzed on the basis of five comparison parameters namely; resource based segregation of IoT enabling devices, range based segregation of the communication network, segregation of security solutions, cloud connectivity, and edge computing services.

AB  - In In fact, this era has been marked at a crossroad of technology and creativity, amalgamating and bringing up the revolutionary peak in the contemporary landscape of literature due to the induction of artificial intelligence into the production and analysis of Indonesia literature. This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence—in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs—from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.

We consider soft concepts and hard concepts that have to be distinguished from each other. “Hard” concepts have been strictly defined in logics more than 100 years ago, but “soft” concepts have not been used in science before the 21st century. We give a brief view on the history of Soft Computing, we distinguish “hard” and “soft” concepts in science, and we consider the opposite pair “Hard Computing” and “Soft Computing”. We separate hard sciences and soft sciences and we give some examples for the key role that soft concepts and Soft computing could play in future soft sciences.

AB  - The objective of present research is comprehensive study related to 5G technology of mobile communication for year 2020 in Indian prospective. The European and American forums started thinking seriously about the next generation of wireless and mobile communication for 2020. A European forum named METIS, Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty (2020). Information Society started working on funded project to identify the 5G future scenarios especially in European environment. METIS funded project also involves many leading technology companies. The guidelines decided by these projects will become basis of shape of fifth generation of wireless technologies. The 4G concept shave already moved to standardization phase, we must begin to work on the building blocks of the 5G networks.5G technology will provide low battery consumption, more secure features and 4A's paradigm ie any rate, anytime, anywhere and affordable. There is a need to study local scenarios and information technology related local demand to give a direction to 5G technology development. The future technology is required to be indigenous, capable to handle local social and economic issues so that use of Information technology may be able to address our issues more effectively. Presently, most of the Europe and USA may not be compared with India, China and third world. Better infrastructure, better economy and less population are some features of Europe and USA. There challenges are different and they develop technology for their growth. In most of the cases we adopt it large cost. Applying technologies in core and routed social aspect is big challenge for nation like India. As our technology and our needs and wants are different from front runners, we need to design the technology more judiciously and economically. We need a technology which enables poor person percentage to grow fast. In this view, we have indentified our own scenario and technological requirement to implement 5th generation of mobile and wireless technologies.

AB  - We consider the problem of computing gate-circuit approximations of quantum algorithms, i.e., unitary operators, from the perspective of computable (effective) analysis. The scientific community thinks the Solovay-Kitaev theorem a mile-stone in quantum compiling - the task of computing gate-circuit approximations - because it proves the existence of efficient quantum compilers in an analytic sense. However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.

AB  - People nowadays cannot think of even a single moment without the internet. Doubtlessly, web applications are currently the key to all change in the world. The features and facilities of web applications make our lives easier and also demonstrate different channels of communication and exchange of data. The number of internet user is increasing day by day in Bangladesh. Web applications are not only encouraging internet users to easily receive diversified services, but also creating new opportunities in every business sector. With the help of web applications, businesses can easily enhance the quality of their services to consumers with minimal effort. However, at the same time, many threats have arisen as a result of the misuse of this technology. Cyber attacks could emerge as a major threat to the digital transformation of Bangladesh, given the vulnerability in web applications caused by careless coding during the development of such applications. During our review, we observed that the existence of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the web applications of Bangladesh was very critical. This paper explores in detail the harmful web application vulnerability attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on Remote File Inclusion (RFI) as well as Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi), and their impact on the applications of Bangladesh.

In this model, a learning activity is defined as a cognitive matrix at a low level in which M rows and N columns are set, each row represents a logical cognitive step of learning procedure, and each column contains all the contents processed by a corresponding component in cognitive architecture. At the meantime, the learning outcome can be produced from contents of column LTDM, AO and AADM of cognitive architecture [7]. A memory consolidation model is also proposed and simulated with PDP tool. Experiment of teaching concept knowledge indicates the effectiveness of the proposed models.

AB  - As a repetition of cognitive activities occurring in designers' thinking process, mental iteration is considered to be a natural feature of a designer's competency. Although the utilization of mental iteration is believed to increase the efficiency of the design process and lead to better quality solutions, the current understanding of it is still limited. This paper presents coding categories that were developed from a study on graphic design behavior. An experiment is conducted to study the effect of AI-augmented on the behavior of mental iteration. The results indicate AI-augment increases the frequency of cognitive activities in design iterations.

AB  - To make computers obtain a deeper thinking, we propose a question semantic representation model based on concept knowledge tree, which integrates concepts and knowledge to express questions' semantics. Combined the question semantic representation model and related knowledge, we introduce a knowledge-driven semantic reasoning algorithm to recursively obtain new knowledge for deepening the comprehending of questions. We evaluate the performance of our system on a collected dataset, and the top-1 accuracy reaches to 62.1%. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed methods improve the depth of question comprehending.
