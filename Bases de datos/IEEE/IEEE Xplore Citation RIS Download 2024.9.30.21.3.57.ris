AB  - This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design procedure and decisions but also the design intents behind them. The design thinking process is evolved based on the interaction among design intents, operations and justifications. The taxonomy of design intents is explored. Based on different pairs of design intents and operations, segments of the design thinking process are identified. A design thinking process knowledge management prototype system is developed for modeling design thinking process. An example of the original design of an automatic teller machine (ATM) demonstrates how the design thinking process model is represented.

AB  - The paper discusses tools for teaching logic used in Logic & Proofs, a web-based introduction to modern logic that has been taken by more than 1,300 students since the fall of 2003. The tools include a wide array of interactive learning environments or cognitive mini-tutors; most important among them is the Carnegie Proof Lab. The Proof Lab is a sophisticated interface for constructing natural deduction proofs and is central, as strategically guided discovery of proofs is the distinctive focus of the course. My discussion makes explicit the broader intellectual context, but also the pursuit of pedagogical goals and their experimental examination. The intellectual context includes i) the theoretical background for the proof search algorithm AProS and its use for a dynamic Proof Tutor, and ii) the programmatic expansion of the course to Computational Logic. (I recommend that the reader enter the virtual classroom of Logic & Proofs: the interactive components just cannot be properly reflected in a narrative. It is also very easy to download AProS and observe its ways of searching for proofs.) 1

AB  - Computation of time-dependent electromagnetic field excited by a varying current distribution is the hardcore of modern computational electromagnetism. However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.

AB  - The intelligence of human being includes three aspects, i.e. mathematics computing, logic computing and imagery thinking. There exists extraordinary unequal understanding between abstract thinking and imagery thinking while too less result on imagery thinking is ready. Simulating imagery thinking on the basis of expert experience is alternative. In the paper, Electrocardiogram recognition based on physicianspsila experiences is discussed as an example. The results demonstrate that the simulation on physicianspsila thinking process is very essential to the success of computer-aided diagnosis.

AB  - This paper presents a simultaneous optimization method of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system using a genetic algorithm (GA) for product designing. Prior research proposed many hybrid models of CBR and the GA for product design. However, those models were not good at aiding at creative designing. In this study, CBR and GA combine with a algorithm process for simulation of directed similarity association according to human being's thought models. Experimental results show that the new hybrid model outperforms other conventional approaches for creative design.

AB  - Creative thinking is one of the hallmarks of human-level competence. Although it is still a poorly understood subject speculative ideas about brain processes involved in creative thinking may be implemented in computational models. A review of different approaches to creativity, insight and intuition is presented. Two factors are essential for creativity: imagination and selection or filtering. Imagination should be constrained by experience, while filtering in the case of creative use of words may be based on semantic and phonological associations. Analysis of brain processes involved in invention of new words leads to practical algorithms that create many interesting and novel names associated with a set of keywords.

This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design activities and decisions but also the design intents behind them. Based on this model, two types of inconsistency in design thinking process are identified. The implementation of consistency check and maintenance is based on assumption-based truth maintenance system (ATMS).

AB  - Natural language's creative genres are traditionally considered to be outside the scope of computational modeling. Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text? And can we automatically insert humorous add-ons into existing applications?

AB  - In this section, we will report on three applications of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in real world parameter optimization. These applications show how the principles, such as robustness and representation independence, make it possible to extend the scope of optimization algorithms available so far and find answers to problems where classical solution methods fail.Evolutionary algorithms are today a state-of-the-art methodology in solving hard optimization problems, and are regularly being used in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In fact, these algorithms have revolutionized the way hard problems are being solved today. The pioneers of evolutionary computation, including Larry Fogel as one the key founders of the field, have been laying the foundations with their creativity and visionary approach toward science.

AB  - Software engineering is defined as a discipline concerned with all aspects of software production from inception to the maintenance of a system. It has often been dubbed as the "cradle-to-grave" approach to producing reliable, cost-efficient software delivered in a timely manner that satisfies the customer's needs. It interleaves the concepts of individual work with team work and the soft skills of technical writing with technical proficiency. Therefore, as computer science educators, we are faced with the challenge of creating a learning experience for our students that effectively introduces the technical aspect of software engineering principles, as well as those essential non-technical skills. The goal of this paper is to describe a work in progress that focuses on creating an enhanced learning experience where computational thinking, collaborative learning, and service-learning are infused into an undergraduate software engineering course. The paper introduces these concepts and how each is used to train students.

AB  - One core issue in reinforcement learning is the balance between exploration and exploitation. Pure exploitation makes the agent reach the partial optimal solution quickly. Exploration avoids the partial optimal solution but too much exploration will reduce the performance of the Q -learning algorithm. How to avoid the partial optimal solution and find the global optimum solution is one of key goals of action selection in Q-learning. In this paper, the thinking of tabu search algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning. The optimized algorithms called T-Q-learning is proved to have a faster convergence rate and avoid the partial optimal solution in the experiments.

AB  - Meta-synthesis approach (MSA) proposed by Prof. Qian is an oriental system methodology for complex problem solving. The essential idea of MSA can be simplified as "confident hypothesizing, rigorous validating", i.e. quantitative knowledge arises from qualitative understanding. Accordingly, creative thinking as a useful and practical technique for complex problem solving, is the unity of divergent thinking and convergent thinking which appear alternatively in the whole creative process of human thinking. In this paper, a computational scheme based on MSA is applied to solve the complex problems. Firstly, group argumentation environment (GAE) as a computerized tool is used to facilitate expert divergent thinking process (meeting) on the concerned topics and form scenario or hypotheses based on qualitative MSA. Then, a quantitative evaluation model had been building to analyze the centralization of the different scenarios, which can used to measure the efficient of different argumentation scenario.

AB  - We are using COMSOL Multiphysicstrade, a commercial finite element modeling software package, to develop simulations of equipment in our unit operations laboratory including a heat exchanger, a gas permeation membrane, and a fluid flow experiment. Our hypothesis is that computer simulations showing the solutions to the differential equations that govern the fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer within the equipment will solidify the link between experiment and theory and provide improved learning. Students in one lab section who used the simulations were compared to those in a control section who did not. A diagnostic quiz given before and after each lab provided a quantitative measure of improvement in learning via the lab experience for both groups. Content analysis of written and oral reports was used to measure any difference in higher level thinking demonstrated by the two groups. Student attitudes towards the simulations were assessed by surveys and end-of-course evaluations. Results so far, in the second year of a three-year project, indicate improvements in student satisfaction and learning but little change in critical thinking that can be attributed to the simulations.

AB  - In many introductory programming courses, the surface features of the programming language can distract and intimidate students so much that they fail to concentrate on what is really the ldquobrainyrdquo task: solving the problem conceptually. To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women.

AB  - The Virtual Cell modeling and simulation framework is the product of interdisciplinary research in biology that applies the diverse strengths and experiences of individuals from engineering, the physical sciences, the biological sciences, and mathematics. A key feature is the separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This reduces software complexity, allowing independent development and verification, but most importantly it clarifies the impact of modeling decisions, assumptions, and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modeling and simulation framework for cell biology. The Virtual Cell has a rich, interactive user interface which connects to remote services providing scalable access to a modeling database and a large dedicated cluster for shared computation and storage. In addition to new modeling capabilities, future developments will emphasize data and tool interoperability, extensibility, and experimentally oriented model analysis tools

AB  - As grid technologies evolve quickly on Internet, research related to resource scheduling faces new opportunities and challenges. These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing the economy-based resource scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical grid model, following load balancing thinking and cost-time optimization strategies, this paper proposes a new grid resource scheduling algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing and utility optimization between resource providers and users within grid systems. On the basis of having described the different functional parts of the proposed algorithm, two kinds of simulative experiments about completion time and cost of tasks are conducted. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.

The major goal of the first part is to create a new way of thinking about politics and economy, viewing them from a different perspective, not only as humanity disciplines but also considering engineering and computational patterns in these sciences. Next, we focus on designing an integrated intelligent government (IIG) by partitioning a government's structure into different intelligent agents which use diverse knowledge bases and inference methodologies. Finally, we illustrate the role of electronic technology in a novel governing framework from various angles and come up with new ideas in this regard to develop participation, democratization, etc by an international electronic government (IEG)

Levinthal investigates the impact to organizational fitness from both adaptive search and the interactions of strategic components within an organization. Despite concerns regarding the applicability of Kauffman's NK model to organization science, Levintha's initial study has received limited critical analysis and has not been independently replicated. Building on previous replication research of Tivnan, this paper describes the formulation, successful replication and critical analysis of Levintha's model of emergent order in contribution towards a model-centered organization science. The paper concludes with a discussion of a credibility assessment of the replication results; namely, model verification and validation.

When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.

AB  - Constructing a realistic systems biology of the mammalian cell will require us to describe molecular and cellular "parts", and to model and simulate their relationships in space and time. To date, most modelling and simulation has focused on temporally dynamic processes including pathways of gene regulation, metabolism and cellular signalling. A goal of the Visible Celltrade project is to integrate spatial as well as temporal models within a common data, computational and visualisation environment to support hypothesis-generation and hypothesis-testing by biologists and modellers. A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services. The Visible Celltrade has been designed as an e-research project and implements computational and data grid standards and technologies.

AB  - Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks

AB  - In order to keep up with the computer science development and national informationization, basic computer education has been deeply reformed in domestic college. After investigating the present situation of basic computer education and its reformation, a new reformatting scheme is proposed. Basic computer education in college should be promoted to information technology literacy education, which students’ information technology literacy and practice ability will be strengthened. In this scheme, the teaching process is divided into three stages: basic information technology literacy education, application ability of information technology literacy education, information technology literacy of specialty education. And modularized courses are prepared for students in each stage. The detail of corresponding lecture and experiment curricula system is also researched.

AB  - Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large "linguistic receptive fields." Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.

AB  - The wall between computer science and electrical engineering has kept the potential of embedded systems at bay. It is time to build a new scientific foundation with embedded systems design as the cornerstone, which will ensure a systematic and even-handed integration of the two fields. The embedded systems design problem certainly raises technology questions, but more important, it requires building a new scientific foundation that will systematically and even-handedly integrate computation and physicality from the bottom up. Support for this foundation will require enriching computer science paradigms to encompass models and methods traditionally found in electrical engineering.

This let us ask: why there is no biological environment for the problem of information retrieval. In this paper, we tried to introduce a new biological environment for information retrieval that broad the modeling concept from the mathematical formula that simulates the basic elements of IR problem to their dual schemas in biology. It's a new way of thinking of, and dealing with, the problem of information retrieval.

AB  - The improved control algorithm in central air conditioning control system is discussed in this paper. Based on a number of practical projects, a primary theory model of expert fuzzy logic controller is established. The expert control ideal is applied in the framework design process of the air conditioning control system. The boundaries of membership function are decided by expert experience, and the flexible control rule set is designed. The realization of the core algorithm depends on parameters adjustable fuzzy-PD algorithm to ensure the control precision and the flexibility. The detailed design steps and key design result are given. The MATLAB simulation result proves the design is reasonable and can be applied in practical projects. The design thinking in this paper is new and can help engineers improve their control strategy in their practical works.

AB  - Recent researches reveal that various paradigms of intelligence, such as natural, artificial, machinable, and computational intelligence, can be unified at the logical and functional levels known as abstract intelligence. This paper introduces abstract intelligence as a form of driving force that transfers information into knowledge and behaviors. An architectural framework of abstract intelligence and the Generic Abstract Intelligence Mode (GAIM) are formally developed that provide a unified theory for explaining the mechanisms of advanced intelligence. In order to deal with the highly complex and abstract objects in abstract intelligence, denotational mathematics is introduced as a category of expressive mathematical structures for modeling and manipulating high-level mathematical entities beyond numbers and sets, such as abstract objects, complex relations, behavioral information, abstract concepts, knowledge, processes, and systems. Applications of denotational mathematics in abstract intelligence, cognitive informatics, and computational intelligence are elaborated.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism for computer generated forces (CGF). The proposed CGF can take actions similar to a human pilot to gain an advantageous status over the enemy target using the intelligent automatic maneuvering mechanism. The mechanism will produce the best multi-step tactics combination (MSTC) for the CGF in an air combat environment. The MSTC is composed of CGF’s decision space. In this paper, based on our previous work, we propose a predictive multi-step fuzzy inference system (PMSFIS) as the automatic maneuvering mechanism for CGF, which incorporates and mimics human thinking capability and the maximum capacity of CGF. Before PMSFIS executes the fuzzy inference system (FIS) process, it will generate a list of MSTC, and allows CGF to predict its future posture corresponding to the list of MSTC. This paper assumes that CGF can accurately predict an enemy target’s future position, then PMSFIS applies the predicted data to generate the best MSTC. We verify the proposed algorithm with a set of fighter flying data that is used as the enemy target’s flying trajectory. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows that PMSFIS will enable CGF to obtain the best status in an air combat environment and improve the performance of our previous work.

AB  - The application of Grid technology is at the transition from engineering and natural science-related industrial sectors to other industries that have a high demand for computing resources. However, the diffusion of Grid technology within industrial sectors which are not naturally engineering and natural science-related is often hindered by a lack of incentives to share the computational resources. A promising way to overcome these barriers is the introduction of economically inspired mechanisms for the use of Grid-based resources. Our work introduces a iterated cost-based multi-unit resource auction (CMRA) and compares a traditional cost-based accounting approach with dedicated servers as well as a pooling approach with regard to service quality and total costs. The cost-calculus used in our model is based on costs for the delayed processing of jobs and costs for the cancellation of these jobs if the job cannot be provided at a certain time span in the worst case. The simulation results indicate that pooling of IT resources by Grid technology can produce a reduction of 20.3% in cost within this model compared to dedicated servers in the computing centers. However, with the CMRA-based allocation of computing resources, a further 1.4% of cost reduction can be achieved while the achieved quality-of-service (QoS) can be significantly increased. Finally we think that there must be a further cost reduction potential for Grid solutions beyond these savings that can be achieved by using economically inspired allocation methods that are combined with advanced refining and learning methods.

AB  - Involvement has become an important variable in consumer behavior and marketing research for a long time. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can explain the complicated relationship between antecedents, consequences, and different types of involvement at the same time to understand the internal state of consumers better. Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.

We hope, however, that our work's meta-contribution is to show, by proof of concept, that you must consider simple, sideways system attacks before you can rely on a system. We encourage engineers of mission-critical systems to look for then cavemen (or squirrels) and to study carefully what actions these adversaries might take against the products they roll out. In this paper we examine simple attacks on routing protocols for wireless networks. In our study, the system was to be a wireless ad hoc network, a collection of independent, possibly mobile computing devices that communicate using radio frequency technology.

AB  - Social relationship is explained under the fuzzy set and fuzzy logic theory. A model for describing the individual nature of mind in the fuzzy environment is presented first, then extended for groups, couples, and social relationship dealing with both perfect and approximate reasoning. The fuzzy social relationship as proposed here also devise that goals of one individual may be seen as constraints upon others, and vice-versa. In this sense, the proposed fuzzy social relationship description is a special case of fuzzy decision-making in fuzzy environment. Moreover, the social relationship is, actually, a simple case of logic mapping. According to the fuzzy social model, the common sense and the advantage of being flexible is emphasized mainly one is interested in a social relationship and in avoiding conflicts. The proposed approach addresses not only human beings, yet it can be extended to describe a sociological perspective of relationship, as well as to overall relationship between societies, nations by including trading and diplomacy.

AB  - In this paper, we present the KnowledgeSeeker, an ontological agent-based system that is designed to help users find, retrieve, and analyze news article from the Internet and then present the content in a semantic web. We present the benefits of using ontologies to analyze the semantics of Chinese text, and also the advantages of using a semantic web to organize information semantically. KnowledgeSeeker also demonstrates the advantages of using ontologies to identify topics. We use a Chinese document corpus to evaluate KnowledgeSeeker and the testing result was compared to other approaches. KnowledgeSeeker is able to identify the topics of Chinese web articles with an accuracy of nearly 87% and has a processing speed of less than one second per article. It is also able to organize content flexibly and understands knowledge more accurately than methods that use ontology definition.

AB  - For limitation of fault diagnosis methods in the engineering machine's hydraulic system, a fault diagnosis method based on multi-sensor information fusion was presented. This method simultaneously had the faculty that fuzzy theory could process uncertain or inaccurate information and the self-study capability of the neural network, which effectively enhanced the fault diagnosis's technical leve1. Collecting samples of data through establishing many sensors in the scene of the hydraulic system, and getting the membership of the fault through the membership function, then through the training of fuzzy neural network by the BP algorithm to achieve exact fault diagnosis function of hydraulic braking system. By contrast the diagnosis result of an example, it indicates that using multi-sensor information fusion as fault diagnosis method is more accurate and reliable than using single information as fault diagnosis method in the hydraulic system fault diagnosis.

AB  - Multicluster Grid has emerged as a major approach for people to pursue substantial computational capability improvement to support large-scale compute-intensive applications. However, it is challenging on how to efficiently manage application execution across the participating clusters, since the participating clusters are geographically distributed, heterogeneous, and self-administrative, and the network connection provided by the Internet is vulnerable in security and unpredictable in performance. The challenges include how to discover resource information, how to handle application workflow, how to allocate appropriate resources, how to make application execution reliable to endure system failures, etc. This paper proposes cluster abstraction to uniform describe and access resources in multicluster Grid. After investigating various cluster resource management systems, a reference description of cluster abstraction is presented to cover cluster computing characteristics, hiding individual cluster details for use. Following this concept, a deployment service is discussed. This deployment service is one of the essential components in ongoing resource management development for multicluster Grids.

AB  - Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code. The goal was to ascertain the kinds of mistakes that are often made, and how a technique like this could be most effective.

AB  - Reconfigurable manufacturing systems have the ability to evolve in response to a change in their environment or a modification of their composition (after a failure of one of its components for instance). This paper propose to use the concept of architecture and configuration to describe both the invariant part of the system as well as the changeable one. The criticality analysis is computed on a configuration. Results can then be used to choose between configurations, enhance one or analyze reconfiguration capability of the configuration. Tools for applying this metric on the model are presented. Results are given for a sample RMS configuration

AB  - A formal theory for abstract concepts and knowledge manipulation is created by Wang recently known as concept algebra. Concept algebra is an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment of concepts and their algebraic relations, operations, and associative rules for composing complex concepts, which provides a denotational mathematic means for knowledge system representation and manipulation. This paper presents a method that shows how the theory of concept algebra is implemented and simulated using typical computers. A visualized knowledge representation tool for concept algebra is developed, which enables machines learn concepts and knowledge autonomously. Nine forms of concept association operations are implemented in the tool to rigorously manipulate knowledge by concept networks. The knowledge representation tool is capable to present concepts and knowledge systems in multiple ways, in order to visualize concept networks by computer simulations.

AB  - The knowledge instinct is a fundamental mechanism of the mind that drives evolution of higher cognitive functions. Neural modeling fields and dynamic logic describe it mathematically and relate to language, concepts, emotions, and behavior. Perception and cognition, consciousness and unconsciousness, are described, while overcoming past mathematical difficulties of modeling intelligence. The two main aspects of the knowledge instinct determining evolution are differentiation and synthesis. Differentiation proceeds from and unconscious states to more crisp and conscious, from less knowledge to more knowledge; it separates concepts from emotions, Its main mechanism is language. Synthesis strives to achieve unity and meaning of knowledge; it is necessary for resolving contradictions, concentrating will and for purposeful actions. Synthesis connects language and cognition. Its main mechanisms are emotionality of languages and the hierarchy of the mind. Differentiation and synthesis are in complex relationship of symbiosis and opposition. This Leads to complex dynamics of evolution of consciousness and languages. Its mathematical modeling predicts evolution of cultures. We discuss existing evidence and future research directions.

AB  - Social modeling applies computational methods and techniques to the analysis of social processes and human behavior. It's expected to provide conceptual and technological tools for supporting analysis and decision making in areas related to national and public security, political stability, law and order, and sociocultural changes. Modeling social and cultural processes must draw on the knowledge obtained within social sciences, including conceptual models, cultural insights, and empirical data. However, how to best integrate social scientific knowledge into modeling remains an open research problem. The author presents the perspective of a social scientist to describe why modeling can be useful for social research on political violence, social conflicts, and cultural changes. She develops an interactionist approach to interdisciplinary research practice and discusses how this approach can help identify the problems related to the integration of social scientific knowledge in modeling. The discussion focuses upon research on political violence and related sociocultural processes.

AB  - Model driven architecture (MDA) is a software development framework based on automatic transformations of models. The first of these models, the computation independent model (CIM), is used to define the business system, and it is usually represented with UML models. Natural language is widely used in requirements engineering as it is generally understandable by stakeholders encouraging their participation. Therefore, in order to enhance the first stages of MDA software development, we propose to define natural language oriented requirements models and derive from them a CIM. To achieve this integration we describe in this paper an automatic process to derive a business class diagram representing the structural aspects of a CIM starting from natural language oriented models.

AB  - Because railway locomotives are complex and highly correlated with each other among its components, it is difficult to make Criticality evaluation by using traditional methods. In the present work, a criticality evaluation index model of the locomotive is established and the Monte Carlo simulation method is employed to obtain the criticality priority of the railway locomotive components. Based on the analysis and method, a program for general calculation is developed and applied to the criticality analysis on DF4D locomotive. The case showed that this method is an effective way to evaluate the criticality of the components of the railway locomotive. In addition, the new method of evaluation of criticality is more objective and suitable for practical situations since the analysis, for example, demonstrates that the equipment components with low failure rate have a high criticality priority. Furthermore, the method is convenient by employing Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, this improved analysis method on the criticality analysis has a practical impact on making decision for the maintenance mode of complex equipment, i.e., railway locomotive.

AB  - In education, computer learning systems make wide use of pedagogical agents to simulate a tutor and/or mimic tutoring interaction, as well as offering just-in-time and adaptive feedback. Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in the literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation web-based learning system call HINTS to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more effective educational tool. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is reported. Some experiments have been conducted and the results show that the pedagogical agent indeed help the students in their learning process.

AB  - The design and engineering of children's artifacts-like engineering in general - exhibits a recurring philosophical tension between what might be called an emphasis on "ease of use" on the one hand, and an emphasis on "user empowerment" on the other. This paper argues for a style of technological toy design that emphasizes construction, mastery, and personal expressiveness for children, and that consequently runs counter to the (arguably ascendant) tradition of toys that work "like magic". We describe a series of working prototypes from our laboratories - examples that illustrate new technologies in the service of children's construction - and we use these examples to ground a wider-ranging discussion of toy design and potential future work.

AB  - Various learning methods are adapted for experimental robot. We can make movement of a robot by giving teaching signals to a robot. But it is heavy for operator to define how to give teaching signals generally because operator must guess and think of a task and environment and define a function to do that. Here the author aim to create teaching signals automatically for each task and environment. In this paper, the author suggest a simple rule which is independent of information about any task and environment to create teaching signals for each task and environment. This rule is that a situation which is often happened is good situation. In this paper, the author adopt reinforcement learning as learning method and a small-sized humanoid robot as application. The author show creating a reward by adapting a rule and show that a robot can learn and make movement.

AB  - The majority of work on artificial neural networks (ANNs) playing the game of Go focus on network architectures and training regimes to improve the quality of the neural player. A less investigated problem is the board representation conveying the information on the current state of the game to the network. Common approaches suggest a straight-forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game. We compare three different board representations for self-learning ANNs on a 5 times 5 board employing temporal difference learning (TDL) with two types of move selection (during training). The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality. A tournament of the best neural players, addition of alpha-beta search, and a commented game of a neural player against the best computer player further explore the potential of the neural players and its respective board representations

AB  - Engineering knowledge is complex. Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once. Normally, individual models and behaviours are taught in several courses, by different teaching staff and in separate years of study. This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.

AB  - Benchmarking is not only about making comparisons but, through these, learning lessons to improve actual performance or knowledge. Comparing modelling paradigms based only on the conceptual model specifications is not enough; rather a well-defined benchmarking process and the execution of experiments are required. A benchmarking strategy is applied to three models of an oil refinery supply chain, using the agent-based or equation-based paradigm. Despite the different paradigms, the models share the same assumptions and model boundaries and an attempt is made to provide same initial conditions and stochastics. The benchmarking process shows that clear definitions of the modelling paradigms are needed to avoid confusion and to enable mining of specific and guiding conclusions from the benchmarking studies. Agent-based models and equation-based models rely on different modelling attributes: The first are mostly identified by the model elements (i.e. individuals) while the latter are mostly identified by the system description elements (i.e. equations). We present a way to visualize this and to add nuance to the choice of labels to allow for the conclusions of the benchmarking study to be generalised beyond the models that are compared, to learn about the advantages and shortcomings of modelling paradigms. Finally, some misconceptions regarding agent-based modelling are identified. The lessons learnt apply to supply chain domain but are extensible to other domains.

AB  - A negotiation-based intelligent tutoring system of which the tutor and learner agents in playing problem-specific roles is developed to assist learner in problem solving through a negotiation mechanism. During the problem solving, fuzzy constraint-directed negotiation is employed to coordinate the mutual thinking between tutor and learner agents, and it can resolve the cognition differences and thereby reach a consensus more effectively. To embody the idea of the proposed methodology, a real-world example relevant to the software cost estimation is described to illustrate how a negotiation can be used for supporting the problem solving in a tutoring learning environment.

AB  - A very interesting and promising numerical method of solving systems of ordinary differential equations based on Taylor series has appeared. The potential of the Taylor series has been exposed by many practical experiments and a way of detection and solution of large systems of ordinary differential equations has been found. Generally speaking, a stiff system contains several components, some of them are heavily suppressed while the rest remain almost unchanged. This feature forces the used method to choose an extremely small integration step and the progress of the computation may become very slow. There are many (implicit) methods for solving stiff systems of ODE’s, from the most simple such as implicit Euler method to more sophisticated (implicit Runge-Kutta methods) and finally the general linear methods. Usually a quite complicated auxiliary system of equations has to be solved in each step. These facts lead to immense amount of work to be done in each step of the computation. These are the reasons why one has to think twice before using the stiff solver and to decide between the stiff and non-stiff solver.

AB  - Experiences of computation vary widely between people. Users ranging from artists to scientists struggle to create programs to meet their needs. Further, the usability implications of designers 'thinking computationally' about social relations such as 'friendship' are highlighted by problems of privacy in Facebook and similar systems. This variability in the experience of computation is more than just an annoyance. Many believe that increasing access to computation will help progress other fields. If they are correct, then these problematic experiences represent a barrier to such progress. This research seeks to addresses this variability in the experience of computation. Computation for creativity, science and society are discussed.

AB  - The security models used in Grid systems today strongly bear the marks of their diverse origin. Historically retrofitted to the distributed systems they are designed to protect and control, the security model is usually limited in scope and applicability, and its implementation tailored towards a few specific deployment scenarios. A common approach towards even the "basic" elements such as authentication to resources is only now emerging, whereas for more complex issues such as community organization, integration of site access control with operating systems, cross-domain resource provisioning, or overlay community Grids ("late authentication" for pilot job frameworks or community-based virtual machines) there is no single coherent and consistent "security" view. Via this paper we aim to share some observations on current security models and solutions found in Grid architectures and deployments today and identify architectural limitations in solving complex access control and policy enforcement scenarios in distributed resource management. The paper provides a short overview of the OGSA security services and other security solutions used in Grid middleware and operations practice. However, it is becoming clear that further development in Grid requires a fresh look at the concepts, both operationally and security-wise. This paper analyses the security aspects of different types of Grids and a set of use cases that may require extended security functionality, such as dynamic security context management, and management of stateful services. Recent developments in open systems security, and revisiting basic security concepts in networking and computing including the OSI security architecture and the concepts used in the trusted computing base provide interesting examples on how some of the conceptual security problems in Grid can be addressed, and on how the shortcomings of current systems and the frequently proposed "ad-hoc" stop-gaps for what are in fact complex security manageability problems may be avoided. This paper is thus intended to initiate and stimulate the wider discussion on the concepts of Grid security, thereby setting the scene for and providing input to a Grid security taxonomy leading to a more consistent Grid security architecture.

AB  - Nanoscale technologies have gone from being just an ambitious concept to being a rapidly advancing area of interdisciplinary science with immense practical importance. Feynman's vision on nanoscience provided great impetus to the development of nanophysics, nanochemistry, nanoelectronics and nanotechnology in general. High resolution microscopic devices such as scanning tunneling microscope, transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscope etc. in mid 1980s allowed researchers to see individual atoms on surfaces and arrange them. The authors (nanobiologists, computer scientists, biotechnologists and material scientists) attempt to provide a review of the state of the art in the field of nanoscale technologies and its impact on various fields of research like computation, basic biology, medicine and agricultural biotechnology. Imprints of memory mechanisms in living systems operating at different levels (e.g. biochemical, immunological and neuronal) have provided inputs to design and fabricate 'bio-inspired' nanoelectronic devices suitable for various applications. Several examples of such nanoscale technology based frameworks and devices are presented in the scenario of their potential role in the development of future nanoscale technologies. Nanoscale technologies might finally revolutionize computational intelligence and thinking. The power and limits of computing processes govern the intelligence, knowledge acquisition and thinking process of human and machine. Present computational methods and models provide us courage to study the problem, but these tools are not yet sufficient to answer the following riddles of machine intelligence - what can computers do better than humans? What can humans do better than computers? And the most important one - what is computable? The authors try to present evidences that show bio-inspired nanoscale technologies might gain the power in helping us to go deeper into these challenges of research in future

AB  - Previous terrorist attacks, system failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that many States face in preparing for national civil contingencies. The diversity of critical infrastructures and the interconnections between different systems makes it difficult for planners to 'think of everything'. For example, the loss of power distribution networks can disrupt rail and road transportation systems. Knock-on effects can also be felt across telecommunications infrastructures as the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS') that protect Internet routers and mobile phone base stations fail over time. Domestic water supplies are affected when pumping and treatment centres lose power. These interconnections make it hard to anticipate the many different safety-related systems that might be affected by particular contingencies. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System that is intended to help government agencies plan for the knock-on effects that propagate between major infrastructures. The intention is to provide a flexible system, which can easily be configured and updated. This is important given that technical innovation and routine maintenance continually introduce changes across national infrastructures.

AB  - Previous terrorist attacks, infrastructure failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that states face in preparing for civil contingencies. One aspect of this is that the agencies which typically coordinate the protection of critical infrastructures have a national responsibility. However, the impact of particular failures is often focused at a local or regional level. For example, Hurricane Katrina was most acutely felt in the City of New Orleans (over 350,000 people affected), with concentrations in suburban Jefferson Parish (175,000) and St. Bernard Parish (53,000) and along the Mississippi Coast (54,000). The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the UK floods of 2007 also show how multiple localised contingencies can occur at the same time. National infrastructure protection agencies must, therefore, be prepared to provide simultaneous help to multiple local agencies. It is for this reason that national civil protection bodies provide national guidance but then devolve responsibility for the implementation of contingency plans to a local level. Unfortunately, many of the regional groups who are responsible for infrastructure protection have little or no idea about the detailed inter-relationships that exist between their own local infrastructures. For example, in the UK 'risk registers' enumerate local hazards without considering how, for example, an attack on a gas storage facility might damage power distribution infrastructures. Nor do they consider the knock-on effects that such damage might have upon water pumping and purification systems. This paper introduces a geographic information system that is intended to help identify dependencies between local critical infrastructures. Although we focus on supporting interaction between local and national contingency planning within the United Kingdom, similar problems affect many other nations. The goal is to support the 'joined up' thinking that is often recommended in the aftermath of previous failures.

AB  - Granular computing is an emerging conceptual and computing paradigm of information processing. Just as a great umbrella, it may be regarded as a label of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules. Extension set theory is a new computational method of knowledge resolution and the significance of attribute. Extension method can be used to describe the thinking process associated with both quantitative change and qualitative change. In this paper, we integrate granular computing with extension method. We utilize the extension method to solve some problems for communicating between information granular worlds. The communication procedures between information granular worlds based on extension method can be established, which is valuable and easy to implement in computer.

AB  - Artificial chemistries are mainly used to construct virtual systems that are expected to show behavior similar to living systems. In this study, we explore possibilities of applying an artificial chemistry to modeling natural biochemical systems—or, to be specific, molecular computing systems—and show that it may be a useful modeling tool for molecular computation. We previously proposed an artificial chemistry based on string pattern matching and recombination. This article first demonstrates that this artificial chemistry is computationally universal if it has only rules that have one reactant or two reactants. We think this is a good property of an artificial chemistry that models molecular computing, because natural elementary chemical reactions, on which molecular computing is based, are mostly unimolecular or bimolecular. Then we give two illustrative example models for DNA computing in our artificial chemistry: one is for the type of computation called the Adleman-Lipton paradigm, and the other is for a DNA implementation of a finite automaton. Through the construction of these models we observe preferred properties of the artificial chemistry for modeling molecular computing, such as having no spatial structure and being flexible in choosing levels of abstraction.

AB  - In this paper a brief survey is provided on a novel approach to adaptive nonlinear control developed at Budapest Tech in the past few years. Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The already achieved results are exemplified via simulation, and the possible directions of the future research are briefly outlined, too.

AB  - The design, realization, and application of intelligent, autonomous, sensor-driven, behavior-based robotic agents are discussed. The authors have identified four philosophical goals for machine intelligence grounded in reality to flourish: integration, real-world issues, interdisciplinary teamwork, and critical thinking. Building a robot requires that the designer integrates control in electronic and mechanical systems and produces a working device, confronts the user with interactions, between different subsystems, and gives the designer the opportunity to trade off between the different subsystems in constructing an autonomous agent. The environment also encourages biomedical engineers to confront the issues involved in getting a physical agent to operate reliably in a realistic environment by giving them the opportunity to build their own animal, providing a unique perspective on the many problems that nervous systems actually solve.

AB  - A fast winners-take-all competition process, termed confabulation, is proposed as the fundamental mechanism of all aspects of cognition (vision, hearing, planning, language, initiation of thought and movement, etc.). Multiple, contemporaneous, mutually interacting confabulations -in which millions of items of relevant knowledge are applied in parallel -are typically employed in thinking. At the beginning of such a multiconfabulation, billions of distinct, potentially viable, conclusion sets are considered. At the end, only one remains. This fast, massively parallel application of relevant knowledge (an alien kind of information processing with no analogue in today's computational intelligence, computational neurobiology, or computer science) is hypothesized to be the core explanation for the information processing effectiveness of thought. This paper presents a synopsis of this confabulation theory of human cortical and thalamic function.

AB  - An integrated series of courses on embedded systems has been developed at Iowa State University, Ames, spanning early undergraduate to graduate levels. The newest course in the series is CPRE 488: Embedded Systems Design, an advanced undergraduate course that fills a gap in the curriculum by providing system-level design experiences and incorporating new technology advancements. CPRE 488 development focused on lecture-lab integration and laboratory learning. Course and lab activities were designed using a learning model that captures lower-order and higher-order cognition levels of Bloom's taxonomy. The learning experience in the laboratory is characterized using a technique to assess cognitive behavior. Results of applying the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior are presented to summarize the depth of student learning and the opportunities for students to progress to higher-order thinking in the laboratory. After two years of experience with the new course, the authors reflect on the course design and outcomes, from both disciplinary and pedagogical viewpoints.

AB  - For many years, local circuit current through gap junctions has been seemed to be the main fundamental route for impulse transmission. In the last few years, some different evidences suggest another view on action potential propagation via myocardial cells. Some researches offered that myocardial cells may not require low-resistance connections for successful propagation of action potential. It seems that some other mechanisms are involved in the action potential propagation. Electrical field has been suggested as the main effective mechanism in action potential propagation. It is demonstrated that in the lack of gap junctions, electrical field is sufficient for action potential propagation. We simulated the mechanism of electrical field and local circuit current separately, studied the effect of these mechanisms on action potential propagation and compared them with each other. Our results demonstrate that although the mechanism of electrical field alters the resting potential of the post-junctional cell, but it is not sufficient to excite the post-junctional cell. These results offer a new view on action potential propagation in which both of the abovementioned mechanisms are necessary for normal cardiac functioning, but in different times of a cardiac cycle. It seems that gap junction has a dynamic behavior in each cardiac cycle, managing different routes of propagation in the diverse moments of normal cycle. Closure of gap junctions allows the negative cleft potential to develop and enhance the cell excitability by reducing cell potential. Then opening the gap junction produces AP. Based on this view, we think that most of the paradox about the role of gap junctions in cardiac impulse propagation will be solved

This approach is illustrated by a reading lamp design example, which uses general mathematical expressions and tree-based genetic algorithm to generate 2D sketch shapes. Then, these 2D sketch shapes are processed to form 3D components and saved in component base. A complex design is produced by combining different components. The result shows that approach is able to generate some innovative solutions and demonstrates the power of computational approach.

AB  - We previously measured human performance on a complex problem-solving task that involves finding which ball in a set is lighter or heavier than the others with a limited number of weightings. None of the participants found a correct solution within 30 minutes without help of demonstrations or instructions. In this paper, we model human performance on this task using a biologically plausible computational model based on reinforcement learning. We use a SARSA-based Softmax learning algorithm where the reward function is learned using cascade-correlation neural networks. First, we find that the task can be learned by reinforcement alone with substantial training. Second, we study the number of alternative actions available to Softmax and find that 5 works well for this problem which is compatible with estimates of human working memory size. Third, we find that simulations are less accurate than humans given equivalent amount of training We suggest that humans use means-ends analysis to self-generate rewards in non-terminal states. Implementing such self-generated rewards might improve model accuracy. Finally, we pretrain models to prefer simple actions, like humans. We partially capture a simplicity bias, and find that it had little impact on accuracy.

AB  - Analyses and syntheses are a pair of fundamental cognitive processes at the meta-inference layer of the brain. This paper presents the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis as a part of the brain’s inference mechanisms. The cognitive foundations of analysis and synthesis are explored, and their mathematical models are created in concept algebra and system algebra by concept and/or system decomposition, composition, specification, and aggregation. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models, the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis are formally described in Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA). The formal modeling and rigorous explanation of this pair of cognitive processes for formal inference reveal a part of the mechanisms of the brain as modeled in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB).

AB  - Grid computing enables sharing, selection, and aggregation of a wide variety of geographically distributed computational resources such as supercomputers, clusters, storage systems and data sources. A grid presents them as one unified resource for solving large-scale and data intensive computing applications. A middleware supports applications in distributed computing environments by providing services that enable the interconnectivity and interoperability of applications, systems and machines. Considering the great development of grid systems, aggregation of several national and international grids offer more resources,improve and optimize the results. However, given the diversity of architectures and middlewares, it is important to think about solutions for interoperability between systems. In this paper, we present an architecture for enabling interoperability between the Tunisian national grid GTRS, based on the Peer-to-Peer middleware XtremWeb-CH, and the grid infrastructure of EU funded project EUMEDGRID based on gLite.In particular, we describe the solution related with the job submission mechanism that allows for users of EUMEDGRID to send jobs to GTRS.A new concept of Super Worker Node is proposed in this work to reach the interoperability between the two grids of GTRS and EUMEDGRID.

AB  - Many methods have been studied for mining association rules efficiently. However, because these methods usually generate a large number of rules, it is still a heavy burden for the users to find the most interesting ones. In this paper, we propose a novel method for finding what the user is interested in by assigning several keywords, like searching documents on the WWW by search engines. We build an ontology to describe the concepts and relationships in the research domain and mine association rules by Genetic Network Programming from the database where the attributes are concepts in ontology. By considering both the semantic similarity between the rules and the keywords, and the statistical information like support, confidence, chi-squared value, we could rank the rules by a new method named RuleRank, where genetic algorithm is applied to adjust the parameters and the optimal ranking model is built for the user. Experiments show that our approach is effective for the users to find what they want.

AB  - This paper proposes a two-tiered, evolutionary architecture for computer based synthesis of textures. In this architecture, a traditional tree based texture generation system is controlled by a set of evolutionary agents. The main contribution of this work is that the user is able to choose the degree of interaction and control they exert over the system. Evolutionary agents are designed to contain information about desirable image features, and they evolve based on user feedback. The agents in turn control the main evolutionary engine for generating textures. This system allows the computer to continue working when the designer leaves without limiting the designerpsilas ability to control the texture generation process when they are available to interact with the system. An experimental implementation is developed to verify the utility of the proposed architecture for texture synthesis. Results show significant improvements in the average user ranking of the agents as the genetic algorithm progresses.

AB  - Portfolio management consists of deciding what assets to include in a portfolio given the investor's objectives and changing market and economic conditions. The always difficult selection process includes identifying which assets to purchase, how much, and when. This paper presents a novel memetic neuro-fuzzy system for financial portfolio management (MNFS-FPM) which emulates the thinking process of a rational investor and generates the optimal portfolio from a collection of assets based on a chosen investment style. The system consists mainly of two modules: the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network realizing Yager inference (GenSoFNN-Yager), to predict the expected return of each asset, and a memetic algorithm using simplex local searches (MA-NM/SMD) to determine the optimal investment weight allocation for all assets in the portfolio. Experimental results on Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) stocks show that the proposed system yields better performance compared to that of existing financial models: statistical mean-variance analysis and capital asset pricing model (CAPM).

The arrival of the computer and its associated technology follows this tradition. By thinking of the computer as an agent, the range of detail that is possible is no longer limited by a person's physical ability and, therefore, new kinds of images are possible. The range of the machine's capability is illustrated by my own large digital portraits. Although pregnant with opportunity, there also exist drawbacks to the process that currently act as stumbling blocks to its widespread adoption.
