AB  - This article presents a comparison between two types of intelligent models: Artificial Neural Networks - ANN and Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System - ANFIS, for forecasting flows in a section of Bogotá (Colombia) river, looking for the most efficient. The simulation was performed in the Matlab computer software, with data collected by hydrological stations of the Corporación Autónoma Regional of Cundinamarca (CAR), from September 2009 to October 2013. The findings suggest that by using artificial intelligence models you can reach a successful outcome, with Correlation Coefficients above 90 % (CC), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 12 %, Concordance Correlation Coefficient to 84 %, six other statistical evaluating precision and accuracy, suggesting that forecasts will be labeled as good and could think of the use of these techniques in Colombia.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice Work-In-Progress paper proposed a multidimensional ability-oriented approach for teaching program with the integration of outcome-oriented, student-centered, project-based and contest-driven. The main contributions were: (1) proposed an Ability-Driven Programming Model (ADPM) from two-dimensions of knowledge taxonomy and practice taxonomy which refined Bloom Taxonomy and defined computer programming ability from four hierarchical levels, they are basic ability, comprehensive ability, engineering ability and innovative ability; (2) designed an improved student-centered pattern to reconstructed contents to make each topic associated with six objectives in Bloom's taxonomy and explored some facts to verify the effect of both student-centered teaching and learning; (3) adopted a project-driven method based on "Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate" to solve complex engineering problems and elaborated on how to design good projects and how to measure the quality of projects in detail. Finally, analysis conducted using survey questionnaires and classroom videos indicates that use of Ability-Driven methodology has motivated students to become active learners and improved engineering practice ability. The Ability-Driven methodology provides an applicable model for a student-centered teaching pedagogy to cultivate students' engineering habits and teach them to think like an engineer.

AB  - An important research problem in designing an open virtual world is how to enable virtual currency exchange between multiple virtual worlds and guarantee the exchange fairness when multiple virtual currencies are adopted as virtual payment instruments in virtual trades between virtual worlds. While an existing VMX theory solved the fairness problem in a VERA algorithm based on a Pareto exchange point [3], a new expecation problem has been found such that exchange requesters might submit minimum acceptable rates (MAR) to determine whether to accept VMX systems-generated virtual currency exchange rates. When exchange requestors think the systems-generted rates are lower than MAR, they select not to accept the systems-generated rates. The withdrawal of systems-generated rates creates the expectation problem such that the fairness has been lost due to Pareto exchange point no longer exists. To solve the expectation problem, this paper has developed a new VERA-RS algorithm by extending the existing VERA algorithm based on a newly developed formal expectancy model and a novel m-stage and n-phase three-level computing framework. VERA-RS algorithm has solved expectation problem by achieving a set of satisfied virtual currency exchange rates.

AB  - Visual information model design needs to integrate with big data sharing, intelligent interaction, authentication security, model building, optimization and energy saving, node privacy and other aspects to give play to the important role of blockchain intelligent interactive data. This paper builds a visual cognitive model around knowledge graph and intelligent interactive data, proposes multiple structures, thinking cognition, multiple modules and intelligent data, and aims at multiple visual cognitive paths of “driving task-effectiveness activity – map visualization – intelligent interaction – model processing” and “data rotation -information graph – multiple knowledge – cognitive model”. It draws the conclusion of the multi-distributed and information intelligentized non-center model structure, realizes the openness, transparency and traceability of all kinds of information data, and makes the blockchain intelligent interactive data more visualization, intelligence, humanization and technicalization. According to the intelligent type media of blockchain, large databases are stored and classified, and a partition block data model is established. A chain structure relationship is formed between block data models, and a layer-by-layer oriented structure is formed. The representation design and interaction design of blockchain intelligent interactive data visualization needs to meet the requirement that the cognitive subject and artificial intelligence can work cooperatively and integrate, so as to create a compound cognitive block model.

AB  - Cloud-COVER is a threat modelling tool allowing users to analyse the way in which threats propagate within their cloud computing deployment. We present extensibility features which allow users to input their own threats, attributes, and connection permissions to Cloud-COVER. This allows users toshift the perspective of the tool to one which better suits their circumstances. By modelling their deployments using different viewpoints, users can ensure a more thorough threat modelling process and can identify threats which might not be identified using Cloud-COVER's default mode. We present examples of how extensibility can be applied to each of three inputs, and how users need to think about the interaction of attributes and permissions to make good use of this feature.

AB  - The quantity of written content about medical information is staggering, and it keeps on increasing daily. Think about the internet, which is full of websites, news, constantly updated status, blogs, and a great deal more. Utilizing search to swiftly scroll through key findings is the most effective method for navigating material mainly because the results are not arranged in any specific fashion. A considerable percentage of this stuff needs to be summarized to emphasize the most significant information. Creating a custom summary with our own two hands of everything that can be effectively done by text summarization techniques. There is a critical need for this automated method. This project incorporates technologies that are capable of summarizing the text automatically. It implies paraphrasing phrases into a single thought. We propose a hierarchical document that represents an architecture for extraction aggregation that utilizes “Longformer” as a set encoder and “Transformer” as a text encoder to represent text documents properly. This model is referred to as the Long-Trans-Extr model. One of the benefits of using Longformer as a set encoder is that the model can take in lengthy documents with a maximum of 4096 tokens, which only adds a little amount of additional processing. This quick summarization tool can be used by doctors or medical practitioners for quickly analysing emergency or critical patients.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is the process of categorizing and locating the emotions represented in a textual source. Sentiment analysis can be used widely in different areas, such as customer review data, feedback data classification, survey responses, and social media comments. Tweets on Twitter contain a variety of sentiments reflecting the perception, thinking, and working background of the user. With the help of the sentiment analyzer, it can define the response of others on any matter or subject of interest. Here, we used machine learning-based NLP (natural language processing) and text analysis technology to define an automated model that can classify the sentiment of a large dataset. Here we used the following three machine-learning classifiers: logistic regression, SVM, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes. The effectiveness and performance of these classifiers are assessed using F1 scores and accuracy. The accuracy of these models is 83%(LR), 81%(SVM), and 80%(BNB) So logistic regression model provides the best result among these.

AB  - Facial expressions are one of the most important elements for our social interaction. Automatic processing and recognition of facial expressions is hence one of the core areas in computer vision, computer graphics, and social signal processing. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and their extensions are widely used for recognizing facial expressions. Most research in this area, however, is done either with a limited set of emotional expressions (such as the six universal expressions), or it concentrates on extracting facial action units (individual muscle movements) from video sequences. Little research has been conducted to analyze the complex facial movements that occur in conversational contexts. Conversational expressions such as "agree", "disagree", "thinking", "looking confused", however, form an integral part of non-verbal communication and systems that can automatically parse and understand such expressions are a key ingredient for the development of efficient human-computer interaction systems. Since conversational expressions may consists of several sub-expressions and contain complex dynamics, however, standard CRF approaches are not suited for the task. In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of CRFs and Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRFs) for recognizing complex conversational expressions. We show the importance of modeling sub-expression dynamics and discuss challenges for applying LDCRFs to recognize a large set of conversational expressions.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of image resizing vs cropping on the performance of state-of-the-art models for the brain tumor segmentation task. This is particularly important since many studies simply resize the image without thinking about potential effects of image distortion on the model's segmentation performance. Since the objective of tumor segmentation is to predict the pixels that comprise the actual tumor, image cropping was performed in order to focus more on the brain and the tumor and not on the background. This conjecture was tested using state-of-the-art models namely 2D U-Net, 2D U- Net with VGG19 as backbone, 2D U-Net with InceptionV3 ad backbone, and 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone. Three different configurations were designed for this purpose. The first configuration used resized images while the second configuration used cropped images. The third configuration used pretrained weights of models of trained on the resized images and then applied them on the cropped images. Overall, the top three models are 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone trained using the resized images followed by 2D U-Net trained also using the resized images and then finally by 2D U-Net trained using the cropped images. As to why cropping did not perform well in this experiment, several plausible explanations were provided in this study.

AB  - In nature, marine cephalopods (such as Mimetic octopus) not only have strong ability of thinking conversion, but also have superior ability of bipedal walking, so the robot adopts the method of octopus bipedal movement. Aiming at the locomotion analysis of the underwater bionic robot, the U-SLIP model is adopted. In order to solve the problem of the difficulty of parameters determination and the walking distance of the underwater bionic robot, a parameter optimization method for U-SLIP model of the underwater bionic robot based on RNA genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the U-SLIP model is built and its dynamic differential equation is solved to get the trajectory of the center of mass. In the process of modeling, through the analysis of the parameters such as buoyancy, resistance, leg extension speed and stiffness coefficient, the gait of the swing phase and the punting phase of the robot is described. Secondly, the appropriate fitness function is designed, and the parameters of U-SLIP model are optimized by RNA genetic algorithm. Finally, the simulation based on MATLAB shows that the optimized model can not only achieve stable walking, but also walk farther in the same time, and the appropriate optimization trajectory is gotten, which the effectiveness of the algorithm for parameters optimization is verified..

AB  - Object-Oriented Modeling is a modeling paradigm mainly used in computer programming that assists the programmer to address the complexity of a problem domain by considering the problem and reduce the effect on model caused by such problem and make designs more robust, more maintainable, and more reusable. It is a design strategy where system designers think in terms of 'things' instead of operations or functions. Object-Oriented software projects are becoming more popular than structured or functional technology based projects. While Object-Oriented modeling are already arriving in the marketplace but their formal foundations are still under development. Object Technology offers support to deliver products to market more quickly and to provide high quality with lower maintenance costs. Quality Assurance is an important field of software engineering and there is need for good Object-Oriented metrics and models for both process and product. The quality of object-oriented design has a decisive impact on the quality of a software product, but due to the diversity and complexity of design properties like coupling, encapsulation etc their assessment and correlation with external quality attributes like maintenance, portability etc is hard. To address these issues, we will use the innovative solution (TRIZ) to enhance quality with available Object-oriented metrics and affecting factors. TRIZ is a problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool that is abbreviation of Russian word Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch which typically rendered as the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving. The objective of TRIZ is development of an algorithmic approach to the invention of new systems, and the refinement of existing ones. In this paper we will apply TRIZ to Object-oriented Models to enhance the quality of Object-oriented design. This paper describes a method based on TRIZ principles and tools that can be easily applied to maintain the quality of Object-Oriented based models.

AB  - Dermoscopic image segmentation is a key step in computer-aided diagnosis of skin lesions. The current medical image segmentation model mainstream uses standard convolution and Transformers as the most important components of the model. However, standard convolution is unable to handle the problems of remote information interaction and long distance spatial dependence. Transformers is a hindrance to its application when dealing with medical clinical data, the insufficient amount of data and the large memory and time required for computation are hindering factors. Recently, HorNet, a high-order spatial interaction model that performs well in natural scenarios, has drawn our attention because the high-order interaction model has the common advantages of both convolution and Transformers. In this paper, we propose a new system that uses the HorNet model, which performs well in natural scenes, for medical image segmentation (skin lesion segmentation). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use a higher-order interaction model for medical image segmentation. We validate our system on three public datasets and do external validation on our own clinical dataset. The experimental results show that our system outperforms other current medical image segmentation models in several metrics. We think this is due to the higher spatial interaction capability and larger perceptual domain of gnconv in HorNet, which can fully and comprehensively capture the information of the overall medical image, which is crucial for medical image processing.

AB  - Nowadays in industrial processes, whether producers or users think highly of performance reliability and robustness of equipments. Therefore, the FDI (Fault detection and isolation) and maintenance techniques have become hot topics for health management of industrial units, as a safety guarantee indeed. As a consequence, researchers have made great efforts to develop, verify and refine diverse diagnosis techniques, meanwhile compare and screening them in order to apply them properly in practice. And then, NASA Ames has built the Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed, a real-world system as a general platform for verification and validation (V&V) of diagnosis techniques. Until now, many researchers have developed effective diagnosis algorithms specially applied to this system. In this paper, we introduce the ADAPT and the diagnosis competition around the system, and we review a variety of diagnosis methods divided mainly in three types, model-based, optimization-based and artificial intelligence-based methods, while elaborating the first type in detail by two sorts of model: physical and graphic, of which the second attracts more and more attention of scientists in actual research. Finally, we make a comparison among them based on simplified metrics of qualification, which plays an important role in choosing appropriate methods for diagnosing a special problem.

AB  - Computer science uses abstractions as a tool for reasoning. It is no surprise that computer science might have something valuable to lend to the world of decentralized stablecoin design, as it is a “computing” problem. In this paper, we examine the possibility of a decentralized and capital-efficient stablecoin using smart contracts that algorithmically trade to maintain stability. By exploiting traditional abstractions from computer science, we show that a capital-efficient algorithmic stablecoin cannot be provably stable. Additionally, we provide a formal exposition of the workings of Central Bank Digital Currencies, connecting this framing to the space of possible stablecoin designs. We then discuss several outstanding conjectures from both academics and practitioners and finally highlight the regulatory similarities between money-market funds and working stablecoins. Our work builds upon the current and growing interplay between the realms of engineering and financial services, and it also demonstrates how ways of thinking as a computer scientist can aid practitioners. We believe this research is vital for understanding and developing the future of financial technology.

AB  - Many researchers have come up with different ways to build a business model architecture for efficient services to run m-commerce applications. The framework for developing mobile commerce applications needs to change at the same time as the IT expansion and business transformation. We are pursuing a theoretical business framework to find an optimal solution for the seamless service-oriented m-commerce application performance. In this approach, we identify the components of m -commerce applications that could reduce mobility barriers and improve application execution time and device energy efficiency. This led us to propose a framework for m-commerce application performance that uses the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) solutions. This plan focuses on making the application run faster and use less energy, and making it easier for users to move around. We help mobile commerce application developers make smart RDMCA (Resource-Demanding M-commerce Applications) that provide good services for mobile commerce businesses and consumers. A theoretical proposed business framework is being set up to find an optimal solution for service-oriented m -commerce application performance. In this way, we find the important parts of the m -commerce system (signal range determiner) that help make the application run faster, use less energy, and make it easier to move around. We think that improving this framework will help mobile commerce app developers to make RDMCA’s that provide good services for both mobile commerce enterprises and end users.

AB  - A number of real-life scenarios involving decision making may be modelled as optimization problems. In these optimization problems, the human preferences and thinking constrain achieving the optimal value of the problem objective(s). If there is a single objective, then the optimization problems are called single objective optimization problems (SOOPs) else the multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs). Various solution methodologies have been proposed for SOOPs and MOOPs, which are useful, as long as the SOOPs and MOOPs involve the numeric data. However, the data is generally in linguistic form (or words), when elicited by the human beings. Therefore, the SOOPs and MOOPs are referred as single objective linguistic optimization problems (SOLOPs) and multiobjective linguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs), respectively, in such situations, to emphasize the existence of linguistic information in optimization problems. In these LOPs, the value of the objective function(s) may not be known at all points of the decision space, and therefore, the objective function(s) as well as problem constraints are linked through if- then rules. Previously, the Tsukamoto's inference method was used to solve these types of LOPs; however, it suffers from drawbacks. As, the use of linguistic information inevitably calls for the utilization of computing with words (CWW), hence, in this paper, we discuss the solution methodologies for LOPs based on the perceptual reasoning (PR). PR is a novel CWW engine design for the CWW approach of perceptual computing. We also demonstrate the applicability of PR based solution methodology for LOPs to the case study of car purchase modelled as LOP.

AB  - Various miniaturized computing devices that store our identities are emerging rapidly. They allow our identity information to be easily exposed and accessed via wireless networks. When identity information is associated with our personal and context information that is gathered by ubiquitous computing devices, personal privacy might be unprecedentedly sacrificed. People, however, have different privacy protection skills, awareness, and privacy preferences. Individuals can be uniquely identified on the basis of only a few identity elements used in combination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to understand the following issues and their relations: a) what identity elements people think are important; b) what actions people claim to take to protect their identities and privacy; c) privacy concerns; d) how people expose their identities in ubiquitous computing environments; and e) how our rational identity exposure model can help to minimize identity exposure. We build a simulated ubiquitous computing shopping system, called InfoSource. It consists of two applications and our rational identity exposure model. We present our experiments and statistical analysis results. Our data show that exposure decisions depend on participants' attitudes about maintaining privacy, but they do not depend on participants' concerns and claimed actions related to identity exposure. Our RationalExposure model helped participants to minimize unnecessary exposures.

AB  - The revolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing dramatically, where everything has become smart, and this new technology has helped facilitate plenty of things for humanity and made life easier in terms of applications and machines that think like humans using artificial intelligence. Currently, many applications of the Internet of Things affect our daily lives. Although the Internet of Things has brought us ease of life, it has brought many challenges related to security. However, solving these issues and challenges requires a high degree of skills. The approach that addresses the increment of cybercrimes is IoT Forensics. IoT forensics is a call for investigating and mitigating these cybercrimes. In this study, we overview the basics of IoT and present an illustrative study of digital forensics and IoT Forensics, then discussing that with some differences between IoT Forensics, Digital Forensics, and IoT Security, and an overview of the Process of IoT Forensics have been discussed. In addition, this work focuses on recent research work from 2018 onwards in terms of IoT Forensics models, frameworks, analysis, and use cases; finally, IoT and Digital Forensics Challenges and open issues have been discussed.

AB  - In these years, many online shopping and investment becomes more time-sensitive such as crowdfunding, online auction, time-limit sale and group buying. Most of them have deadlines. Consequently, people need to make faster decisions than other products leading to more conformity in this area. Though there is much work about the conformity and social influence in social networks, there lacks work of conformity in the online shopping and investment, because in these scenarios there is usually no such "strong" connection. However, we think the conformity information is also important for the sale prediction of time-sensitive products, since conformity impacts people's purchase decisions. In this paper, we propose a model which captures the dynamic conformity and apply it to the similarity computation and sale prediction of time-sensitive products. It can be dynamically adjusted to fit the target product and the prediction moment, which means it is well self-adaptive. Since it also gives the consideration to other static and latent features in a collaborative way, it alleviates the "cold start" problem nicely and is free from the presetting hypotheses. Experiments on the real large-scale dataset shows that our method exceeds other comparison methods by 33.2% in the sale prediction.

AB  - As a game that spreads across the Internet and stimulates people to think and learn, data mining of Wordle's report counts and their distribution is particularly important. In this paper, an ARIMA model and a BP neural network model based on the WOA are developed to perform in-depth data mining on Wordle. For model I, this paper uses ARIMA model fitting to fit the trend of the total number of historical report results over time, and obtains the R2 of the model as 0.986. Based on this, this paper establishes a prediction model for the interval of the total number of reports, and gives the prediction interval of the total number of report results on March 1, 2023 as [21211], [21814]. For Model II, this paper defines word attributes as the following four indicators: for example, the commonness of the word, the number of occurrences of the same letter in the word. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the percentage of reported scores to the total reported scores in the Hard mode and the word attributes was calculated. Finally, in the Hard model, the percentage of reported scores out of the total reported scores was significantly correlated with how common the word was and whether it began with a vowel letter. For Model III, this paper constructed a BP Neural network model based on WOA, which, in this paper, uses word attributes as the input layer and the report distribution of words as the output layer. In the WOA, the optimal weights and thresholds of the BP neural network are obtained in this paper by continuous search and approximation. The final model has a Mean Absolute Error value of 0.38, both of which have good performance. At the same time, this paper predicts the results of “EERIE”, and the obtained distribution results are rounded to [1], [7], [20], [22], [21], [19], [10]. Through the above modelling and calculation, this paper mines Wordle's user data, which has some theoretical significance for the healthy development of Wordle.

AB  - The traditional set covering models did not consider the equity of users that carried by each set. We developed a new method to solve that for the Integrated Delivering System (IDS) in medical service in Taichung city. This method requires grouping the clinics in equal market share in a way that satisfy the equity conditions given. It uses Voronoi blocks as market share for each clinic within the study area and calculates the house and clinic ratios as the equity conditions. For each scan, the selected block merges with one of the adjacent blocks using five conditions with different weights. This process continues until the objective functions are met. This model opens up a new way of thinking for set covering by grouping the block objects to obtain optimal result. The result is workable and can be reproduced by computer program if the same data set existed.

This paper focuses on the two companies' Latin American market portfolios in 2008, comparing the portfolios with respect to the attractiveness of their markets and the companies' competitive positions in them, and how they changed from 2002 to 2008. The degrees of market attractiveness and competitive strength the portfolios possessed, as well as their variability across the markets in the portfolios, are considered. The portfolio analysis technique employed in the paper may have wider applicability for formulating corporate strategy.

AB  - Object detection is an essential task in the field of computer vision. The one-stage object detection model directly completes object detection through a single forward propagation and has fast real-time object detection capabilities, making it widely used—especially the model of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series. Improving the detection accuracy of the YOLO model has always been a research topic. The gradient architecture cascades feature information extraction and aggregates all features at the end, which can improve the feature fusion ability of the network. Combining the idea of gradient architecture, this paper proposes a YOLO based on gradient architecture: Gradient-YOLO. Specifically, this paper integrates gradient architecture into the backbone, neck, and bottleneck structures in the YOLO network, obtaining gradient backbone, gradient neck, and gradient bottleneck, respectively. By combining gradient architecture, various network parts in Gradient-YOLO can fully aggregate multi-layer features, reduce feature loss, and thus improve detection accuracy. This paper takes the mature YOLOv5 model and the latest YOLOv8 model as the baseline and combines gradient thinking to obtain Gradient-YOLOv5 and GradientYOLOv8. Moreover, conduct experimental testing on the MS COCO dataset. Regarding the mAP@.5 detection indicator, compared to YOLOv5s, Gradient-YOLOv5s increased by 5.07%. Compared to YOLOv8n, Gradient-YOLOv8n has increased by 4.63%. Therefore, the combination of gradient architecture can improve the detection accuracy of YOLO networks.

AB  - Big Data is a relatively novel research field that has attracted high interest from the industry and academia for its wide applicability. Numerous definitions of Big Data have been given by scholars from different perspectives. We think the Big Data research field could be better appreciated by analyzing the relevant scientific articles published over the years. However, the sheer volume of the Big Data related literature needs a more efficient way to analyze them. As such, we utilize the knowledge domain analysis techniques developed by information scientists to build the intellectual structure and uncover the main research themes, which afford us a holistic view of the overall Big Data research field. Based on our analysis, the research themes of Big Data may be classified into four main categories: the first one deals with the technologies and architectures aspect of Big Data; the second one relates to the prospective applications of the Big Data analytics; the third one covers levels of parallelism in the Big Data processing stacks; the rest encompasses mostly machine learning related studies and some miscellaneous topics that may benefit from the Big Data processing capabilities.

AB  - With many gaps and shortcomings in the field of IoT security, no matter how simple you think it is on your side what goes inside an intrusion detection system technique to detect attacks. This study explores the current state of IDS in IoT. The most important points of vulnerability are identified, and we examine ways to address them immediately. One key finding of the research is that interoperability problems between differing IoT devices and platforms loom as two big roadblocks. Besides, the lack of standardized evaluation standards or sets for intrusion detection models in IoT environments turns out to be an important gap between what is being researched currently and reality. The ambiguity of how to upscale in large IoT networks is cited as an issue left unresolved by the study. In addition, it points toward the crucial role intrusion detection plays in safeguarding IoT systems and also reveals existing areas of weakness with regard to adaptability, scalability and standardization..

AB  - The increasing industrial acceptance of cloud-based IT services has led to a paradigm shift in the development and operation of complex business applications. IT managers are incorporating cloud-based IT services as replacements and/or as enhancements for existing on-site solutions. This strategy leads to the concept of a federated business application, which consists of a variety of on-site and cloud-based subparts, dynamically orchestrated to a single solution. In this setting, the selection of appropriate IT services is critical. Following the discussions of environmental thinking in IT aspects like Green IT and Green IS, the issue of appropriate IT service depends on not only functionality and costs, but additionally also on the environmental impact of the service selection. To address this issue, this paper presents a service selection model for cloud-based services with a focus on the environmental aspects of the selection process. This is done by modeling a multi-criteria decision model based on the rational choice theory. The proposed model provides a selection process which leads to maximal service functionality coverage with minimal environmental impact for a given service provider setting. The application of the model is illustrated in a typical industry case.

AB  - Repeated loan fraud threatens financial stability and drives away clients. Financial and banking institutions must immediately recognize network fraud. The banking sector in India and other countries is using AI-driven technology and machine learning algorithms to tackle fraud and unauthorized access. Innovative thinking, increased globalization, and technical developments are raising fraud detection costs. The suggested study would help banks identify credit application fraudsters. The study automated data preprocessing using Kaggle's K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network classified. Using the Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA) to fine-tune the classifier hyperparameters improved results. VSA determined the model's hyperparameter sweet spot. The suggested model outperforms other categorization methods with 98.62% accuracy. Better lending banking fraud detection may result from the proposed approach. The VSA-based 1DCNN model detects fraud faster and more precisely.

AB  - Literature of studying algal growth has started to take advantages of data mining and machine learning methods, such as classification, clustering, regression, correlation analysis and principal component analysis. However, the performance of such methods might heavily rely on the data collectable for the studies sites. Moreover, some factors directly relate to algal growth, including hydrodynamics, weather and ecology, are notoriously difficult to model and predict. In this paper we present a study to model algal bloom using deep learning methods. It is assumed that algal bloom is the consequence of all factors that are more or less associated with the growth of algal. This offers a new way of thinking that even unknown factors or those factors far too complicated to model can still be inexplicitly represented by the deep learning models. We evaluate this new approach through our studies of algal bloom in the JinJi Lake, Suzhou, China. The experimental results are compared with the popular machine learning methods used in literature. It has been found that the deep learning method can achieve a better accuracy in comparison with other well applied machine learning methods.

AB  - In modern robots, the usage of computationally expensive models involving deep neural networks, also referred to as DNNs, for tasks such as the localization of operations awareness, planning, and object recognition is becoming prominent. Nevertheless, resource-constrained machinery, such as low-power aerial vehicles, often lack the requisite internal computing resources to easily run cutting-edge simulations of neural networks. Cloud robotics appears as an answer, allowing robots to offload processing to centralized computers for greater precision models. Nonetheless, the ignored downside of cloud robots lies in the possible delay and data loss experienced during contact over crowded wireless networks. This study discusses the Robot Transferring responsibility Problem, exploring when and where robots should offload sense tasks that improve accuracy while reducing the costs involved with cloud communication. The method involves framing shifting as a sequence decision-making issue concerning robots and suggesting a remedy using sophisticated reinforcement learning. Through models and hardware tests employing advanced thinking DNNs, what was suggested sharing strategy improves vision task efficacy by 1.3 2.6 times as a result of standard strategies, allowing robots to increase their sense accuracy while incurring minimal communication via cloud costs.

AB  - If Artificial Intelligence is powerful, then it would cover a wide spectrum of jobs that commonly is done by humans that might require a high level of abstraction and mathematical creation. In this paper, the possibility that Machine Learning through the criteria of Mitchell can produce original contribution at basic sciences, such for example at the theoretical physics, is investigated. Basically, it is shown that theoretical physics is essentially based in laws by which are employed mathematical apparatus based at differential equations, integrations, commutators of operators, closed-form algebra, etc. In this way, the Mitchell criteria might constitute an algorithm to generate new theoretical structures in physics. It is investigated if it is appropriate to claim that Artificial Intelligence is able to replace the human thinking to create new theoretical physics with relevance and with a solid prospectiveness.

AB  - In this paper we propose a re-thinking of ICT infrastructure to include a framework that exploits commodity many-core systems to evaluate models. The framework permits comparison, evaluation and improvement of competing and complementary models. Our proposal focuses on the computationally intensive tasks associated with near-field parallelism to process environmental conditions in real-time to deliver informed warnings to populations at risk. By keeping a human-in-the-loop, we include new services that support crowd-sourcing within the framework, allowing integration of sensor data with media-rich voluntary participant input. Monte Carlo simulations of relevant ocean models highlight necessary precursors and likelihoods of potential threats. This paper provides a survey of existing systems, both from tsunami modeling and other domains with similar real-time constraints, and evaluates the applicability of our proposed framework, PREDICT, for near-field tsunami early warning.

AB  - Computing technology has indeed become pervasive. Taking a quick look around me, I see computing systems in literally everything—in the cars, televisions, smartphones, restaurants, ski-lifts, heating systems, sports trackers, medical devices, etc. This has been realized by a tremendous development in hardware and software technology in terms of CPUs, memory, sensors, operating systems, network, display, etc. However, looking back at this technology development—and the research done in the field—it strikes me that something is missing. One of the grand visions was to make the computer “invisible,” as framed by Weiser. But it seems like instead of computing becoming more invisible, it is taking up more of the user’s attention. In this article, I argue that this is because (pervasive) computing has only come halfway. Much effort has been done in terms of sensing and understanding the world around the user, while much less effort has been put into helping the user actually doing anything. By providing examples mostly taken from the medical domain, this article discusses if moving from “sensing” and “thinking” to actually “doing” something is possible and what challenges are associated with this movement.

AB  - In the field of education ChatGPT has sparked both admiration and controversy. This study explores students' perspectives, specifically focusing on those in computer science-related fields. We investigated their motivations, trust, perceptions of utility, and reliability of ChatGPT by conducting two surveys-one at the beginning and another at the end of the semester. During the semester, students were encouraged to engage with ChatGPT. Our findings highlight the tool's multifaceted use in an academic settings, establishing it as a valuable resource for a variety of learning tasks. Most students have incorporated ChatGPT into their regular academic activities and view it as a beneficial aid. They perceive it as a multi-task solver and anticipate significant advancements in its writing assistance features in the near future. Many, not only attribute high accuracy to it but think that it adheres to appropriate content and structural norms. Our results suggest that active confrontation with ChatGPT enhances understanding of its capabilities, limitations and autoregressive nature. Consequently, we recommend an approach of informed engagement that includes the distinction between language processing and genuine language understanding and a carefully crafted terminology.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been utilised in message sentiment analysis, and both have produced promising results. CNN overlooks the coherent semantic information between words despite its ability to separate nearby information between successive articulations of a sentence. Many of the current sentiment analysis methods are seeking to extract the complicated semantic also, linguistic data from the message, however they are not especially applicable to the examination of understudy opinions. For the study of student message sentiment, the CNN-BiGRU-AT model—often referred to as a novel convolutional neural network with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and an attention mechanism—is developed. The removal of n-gram information from each sentence is subsequently accomplished using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The sentences are then consecutively condensed through the bidirectional gated intermittent unit to dispose of the message's significant semantic data parts (BiGRU). The CNN-BiGRU model is then given a thinking mechanism, and by including the attention score, different learning loads are introduced to the model. The disclosures display that its structure's accuracy rate and audit rate dependably outperform 0.9, and the F1 regard isn't lower than 0.8. These figures are superior to those of various models.

In order to enable users to better understand what kind of online phishing they have suffered, and enable scholars and researchers to more quickly customize detection for different types of online phishing detection. We need an in-depth summary of the existing types of online phishing and various detection methods. This paper classifies and summarizes all kinds of phishing, mainly introduces six kinds of phishing, including E-mail phishing and search engine phishing. For phishing detection methods, this paper also summarizes and classifies existing and widely used detection methods into seven categories such as list-based heuristic machine learning, and introduces them in detail. Then the paper analyzes the big data frontier technology and detection channel direction of assisted anomaly detection, and divides it into stream processing technology, Hadoop DPI parsing keyword recognition, web crawler recognition, etc. Finally the paper discusses and thinks deeply about the methods and techniques mentioned above as well as the current situation of phishing detection, and puts forward some forward-looking suggestions on the interpretation of data processing model selection and general detection architecture.

AB  - The national colleges and universities’ large-scale application of online education during the Covid-19. Academic dishonesty frequently occurs, leading to society’s attention to the problem of academic honesty. As a vital reserve force of academic talents, undergraduate students should pay more attention to their academic honesty. Nowadays, undergraduate students’ academic consciousness is weak, and their academic dishonesty is gradually showing new characteristics and problems under the large-scale application of online education. In the face of increasingly frequent and diverse academic dishonesty problems, various academic misconduct detection systems supported by computer technology have played a positive role in solving the problem of academic dishonesty among undergraduate students. We must study and think about improving undergraduate students’ academic honesty education with the development of online education combined with computer technology. This paper probes into the problems existing in undergraduate students’ academic honesty education under online education. Then it constructs the academic honesty education model from undergraduate students themselves, legal system, academic honesty training, and academic honesty supervision management mechanism, four aspects of standardizing undergraduate students’ academic behavior and forming an excellent academic moral atmosphere in colleges and universities.

AB  - Significant progress in video question answering (VideoQA) have been made thanks to thriving large image-language pretraining frameworks. Although image-language models can efficiently represent both video and language branches, they typically employ goal-free vision perception and do not interact vision with language well during the answer generation, thus omitting crucial visual cues. In this paper, we are inspired by the human recognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill, a framework with language-aware (i.e., goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and answer generation. VideoDistill generates answers only from question-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering approach that closely resembles human behavior, distinguishing it from previous research. Specifically, we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace the standard cross-attention, avoiding language's direct fusion into visual representations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the entire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling module, which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics relevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module that merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure extracting multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct evaluations on various challenging video question-answering benchmarks, and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and long-form VideoQA datasets. In Addition, we verify that VideoDistill can effectively alleviate the utilization of language shortcut solutions in the EgoTaskQA dataset.

AB  - The generalization ability of current intent recognition methods is insufficient, and the evaluation of confidence level of intent recognition is the key to its popularization and application in the high-reliability military and civilian fields. The spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph can uniformly represent and efficiently organize entities containing spatial location information and temporal information. Battlefield situational objectives and their relationships can be abstractly expressed as a triplet composed of two specific types of spatiotemporal entities and combat intent relationships. Using typical confrontation scenario data to train neural networks, and fusing the confidence levels of the entity and Knowledge Graph, the confidence level evaluation results of the intent triple facing the existing spatiotemporal knowledge base are calculated. The simulation test results show that the method can effectively evaluate the confidence level of intent recognition results, and the accuracy rate is improved by more than 9% compared with the KGTTM model. This method breaks the “closed” assumption of the Knowledge Graph update and completion algorithm from the level of algorithm thinking, and completes the last link of the popularization and application of intent recognition methods.

AB  - Complexity of technology is constantly increasing; for the field of automation this means that economic considerations dictate a need for corresponding measures. Artificial intelligence boasts noteworthy successes in this area; however, its achievements appear modest when compared to the faculties of human intelligence. This paper will demonstrate that a new modeling approach is required via possibilities offered by the mindset and tools of computer technology, thereby demonstrating why a psychoanalytic approach seems sensible and necessary. The paramount goal of the research introduced in the following is a formal approach to describing the human psyche based on the neuro- symbolic and neuronal functional layers. Questions associated with this approach include: To what extent can the psychoanalytic model be confirmed by computer technology and the possibility of simulation? To what extent is an axiomatically developed terminology in psychoanalysis a prerequisite for the better integration of the natural-scientific way of thinking in psychoanalysis? The paper is based on the results of several fundamental research projects within the framework of ARS (Artificial Recognition System) which were funded in part nationally and in part by the EU.

AB  - Nowadays, we all know that due to the health emergency situation most of the universities and colleges opted for the virtual education. In this pandemic the student's learning process was affected mostly. So due to that purpose most of the educational centers proposed the virtual system. Many educational centers started their classes on different virtual tools such as Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Skype and Zoom. So, the main objective of this paper is on the impact of student learning in video conferences. Most of the teachers were familiar with those tools; However, about 24% of them stated that their academic performance has been improved. But some of the teachers were facing some of the difficulties on a psychological level due to the new teaching procedure. In this paper we are using Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the student’s behavior. After this analysis to prove that students and teachers agree that these virtual tools are very helpful in the online classes. "The challenges of this paper are that the teacher may know the student’s learning activity rate in online classes".The primary of this project is to develop a self-contained agent that can provide information to both teachers and students. Important academic outcomes such as critical thinking and the grades students receive in a topic are closely tied to the extent of student involvement.

AB  - This chapter describes the computer modeling of a psychic system that generates representations for a system that has an artificial corporeality. In this model, it defines how the sensation of thinking is formed in an artificial system and how such an artificial system can experience its idea generation. Next, the chapter discusses a multiagent approach to design the artificial psychic system. Further, it describes the organizational memory of the system. The organizational memory will be organized into networks of memory agents related through concepts of semantic proximities or semantic generalizations. The concepts of proximity, specialization and generalization can be precisely defined using qualifications related to the acquaintances of the agents. The chapter finally shows that the general psyche of an artificial system, when it is distributed over multiple corporeal systems with local artificial consciousnesses, can be unified.

AB  - The reliability of an item is the probability that it will adequately perform its specified purpose for a specified period of time under specified environmental conditions [1]. Uncertainty [2] in reliability prediction for complex electronic systems/equipment is mainly originated from the incomplete considerations on the specified environmental conditions and on the impacts to the equipment. This paper focuses on the incomplete considerations on the space radiation environment (SR see Acronyms in table 1) and their impacts on complex electronic equipment in satellites, airplanes, and ground network computers working daily in SR. Based on Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) analysis framework [3], this paper proposes an accurate reliability prediction method to accommodate SR and SR impacts on complex electronic equipment to avoid uncertainties originated from the incomplete considerations on SR theoretically more complete or accurate than the traditional methods, such as FIDES [4], MIL-HDBK-217 [5], etc, which has not considered SR. This paper is creative on the following 3 novel points. (1) SR reliability concept: For accurate reliability prediction, this paper proposes an SR reliability concept based on RIDM framework. The concept accommodates SR and SR impacts critical to mission success by the SR reliability definition and the RIDM 5 steps analysis method to have a close loop systematic thinking on incomplete considerations on SR. (2) SR reliability model: For an accurate reliability prediction based on the SR reliability concept, this paper proposes a new SR reliability model focused on the SR impact rate for complex electronic equipment, connecting the incomplete considerations of SR with mission success in a close loop by 1) The relationship [6] between Reliability and SR impact rate, 2) The relationship [6] between SR impact rate and TID, DD, and SEE impact rate, 3) The relationship between SEE impact rate and SEE effect rate. (3) SR reliability prediction application and verification: This paper provides 3 case studies on satellite, avionics, and ground network computer applications. Additionally, the SR impact rate for avionics of a satellite navigation receiver prototype is predicted and compared with the test results [7] with good agreement. Case studies show that for safety critical applications, the SR impact rate is significant and not negligible. And the SR reliability concept and model is practical and useful for displaying possible key contributions to SR mitigation strategies or Defense-in-depth systematically for mission success.This paper gives an example for the accurate reliability prediction based on RIDM, focusing only on accommodating SR. However, as a general systematic method, it can be applied in broader areas on more SR and non-SR stresses.

AB  - Our brain can effortlessly recognize objects even when partially hidden from view. Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however, this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches, which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models.

AB  - Social media has become an essential means for communicating the review/opinions of people around the world due to the rapid expansion and availability of the internet. Reviews and opinions are expressed both as text and audio. But text communication via networking media is overwhelming. Each and every second, a vast amount of information is produced online because of social media sites. However, online reviews on social media provides an excellent and trustworthy channel for examining the areas that require improvement and for understanding the needs of customers. This paper tries to understand the various topics that are discussed by customers about food with the aim of providing an insight to improve the area where there are negative comments. By doing this, customer retention will increase and gradually the business also. Topic modeling is done to find the hidden topic in a set of comments or customer reviews to find out on which topic customers are talking, thinking, or discussing more about restaurant services. It helps to read customers' mindsets, and accordingly, improvements can be made to increase consumer demand for a restaurant. So, a system is proposed to detect topics of textual reviews of different restaurants using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modelling approach. A probabilistic, statistical strategy for document designing called latent document analysis (LDA) identifies latent semantic topics in sizable corpora. The dataset used for this study was taken from Kaggle, which had 111,105 reviews. First, topics from reviews were extracted using the LDA model, then data was visualised using the LDAvis tool. The experiment's findings show that the analysis obtained a successful topic division outcome especially in long-to-short text level topic classification.

AB  - Artificial general intelligence revived in recent years after people achieved significant advances in machine learning and deep learning. This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research. It is believed that a better alignment between them would further boost the fusion of diverse research for achieving desired cognitive machines.

AB  - Three-way decisions model adopts the idea of’’rule by three divisions’’ and “simplify complexity which provides a multi-level and multi granularity thinking framework and implementation method for solving complex uncertain problems. Within this framework, how to extend the application of the generalized model from decision system to interval-valued decision system is an important issue. In this paper, we propose multigranulation sequential three-way decision models in inter-valvalued information system. Firstly, three types of similarity relations from the view of optimistic, pessimistic and weighted are defined. Based on these similarity relations, the lower and upper approximations under multiple granular structures are computed. Then optimistic, pessimistic and weighted arithmetic strategies are adopted to compute three disjoint regions in each level of multigranulation sequential three-way decisions. Furthermore, nine types of multigranulation sequential threeway decision models were analysed. Finally, the experimental results show that the size of the probabilistic regions varies with the similarity relations and aggregation strategies.

We reveal some quirks of modern human-consuming commercial CAEs, and their limitations. Next, we have described the main benefits and shortcomings of the open-source software development model (from the developers' perspective), which as we think suits our needs best. We have briefly overviewed some modern software technologies, on top of which any advanced CAE could be built. Most of them are open-sourced. In addition, we justify using Matlab technical computing language for prototyping domain specific CAE systems. In conclusion, we present a prototype of a 2D preprocessor with direct editing capabilities for domain-specific CAE for electron beam optics design.

AB  - The vast majority of email viruses propagate by ensuring that every address included in the address book of the victim is sent the malicious message or attachment. There are a variety of approaches that can be utilized in order to package and present these viruses. Some of them can be immediately identified as malicious based on the content of the body, the sender, who may or may not be trustworthy, and the subject lines, which are just unintelligible. It may be difficult for receivers to identify individual email messages that include malware since the malicious actor puts a lot of effort into making it appear as though the email message was sent from a respectable sender. Phishing is an attempt to steal sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity, typically a business. Cybersecurity is an extremely important topic in the field of information technology. Information security is one of the most pressing problems facing our generation at the moment. When we think of cyber security, the first thing that comes to mind is cybercrime, which is expanding at an alarming rate. This is because cybercrime is the most common kind of online crime. In order to put an end to these cybercrimes, various governments and businesses are pursuing a variety of preventative measures. In spite of the many safeguards in place, a significant number of people continue to be anxious about the safety of their online activity. The difficulties surrounding the use of email viruses as a threat to cyber security are the primary focus of this article. From the point of view of email viruses, a unified approach for assessing the level of cyber security has been developed. In addition to this, it examines the most recent developments in the methods of cyber security, as well as the ethics and trends that are influencing the industry.

AB  - The automatic generation of image descriptions is leading the field of computer vision and natural language processing-based research. Image captioning is a key task that calls for a semantic understanding of the images and the capacity to create descriptions with right structure. Image captioning is a complex problem as it often demands accessing data that might not be visible in each scene. It will require logical thinking to evaluate or have in-depth knowledge about the object present in an image. In this study, we developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network to produce words that describe the images, and we used Long Short-Term Memory to accurately construct relevant sentences out of the words that are produced. To generate an accurate description, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model first compares the targeted image against a huge dataset of training samples. In this study, we have used the Flickr 8k dataset. We have used the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric to determine how well our model is generating captions for the images. It evaluates the generated text that has been translated from one language to a different language to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine translation system.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa serve as a reminder of the social, economic and health burden of infectious diseases. The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics. In this talk I will overview of the state of the art in computational networked epidemiology with an emphasis on computational thinking and on the development of high performance computing oriented decision-support environments for planning and response in the event of epidemics. I will describe how such systems can be used to support near real-time planning and response during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the recent Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. Computational challenges and directions for future research will be discussed.

AB  - The graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is a branch of decision-making; therefore, how to scientifically abstract the evaluative thinking of decision-makers (DMs) has always been a core research point in decision science. In this context, further consideration of the heterogeneous behavior of competitors and their impact on the evolution of conflicts deserves special attention. Usually, DMs' evaluation thinking has certain ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are accustomed to giving qualitative evaluation information. Given the unique advantages of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS) in the fusion of decision domains and transformational linguistic expressions, this paper constructs a theoretical framework for a graph model on TrIT2FS and proposes a method for calculating DMs preference ranking and a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function. Firstly, the DMs will consider multiple factors in the decision evaluation process, and there are specific regret avoidance psychological behavior characteristics; thus, this paper integrates VIKOR and regret theory to solve the DM's preference ranking and expands on a new preference ranking method. Secondly, mixed stability definitions based on TrIT2FS are proposed to facilitate the description of different sanctioning behaviors of heterogeneous opponents. Subsequently, a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function is proposed to quickly obtain conflict evolution solutions in complex dynamic conflict problems based on the extended mixed stability definitions. Finally, to thoroughly test the correctness and practicality of the proposed theory, the conflict between inputs and outputs of the technological transformation of enterprises under the low-carbon strategy is used as a specific application scenario and example for validation.

AB  - In this era of large-scale data, distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity hardware provide cheap and reliable storage and scalable processing of massive data. With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (1018 bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O), can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine.

AB  - With more emphasis on internet as a primary mechanism for information access and communication, it is highly important that the platform stays safe and secure for anyone who uses it. Online scams and cybercrimes are becoming a common threat to the technology and systems that help mitigate these issues are in high demand. Businesses all over the world invest heavily to stay secure in the cyberspace and rely on security experts in defending their business from online threats. The immense scale of the internet and the dynamicity of the threat it holds forces the adoption of automated threat detection systems. Several cybersecurity use cases exist, but the two use cases discussed here are DGA detection and Malicious URL detection. This paper addresses the drawbacks of previous rulebased and machine learning based detection methods. Here, embedding concepts from NLP is incorporated into cybersecurity use cases to propose a new in house model christened S.P.O.O.F Net, which is a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Network. The proposed model is benchmarked with machine learning algorithm incorporating bi-gram feature engineering techniques and also a conventional CNN with character level embedding (same as the one used for S.P.O.O.F Net). It was observed that S.P.O.O.F Net gave better performance over the aforementioned methods with accuracy scores of 98.3% for DGA detections and 99% for malicious URL detection. This work also aims to demonstrate the possibilities of incorporating NLP concepts to cybersecurity use cases and provide future researches a new thinking curve to develop systems in this domain.

AB  - Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have garnered significant interest in research on high-performance computing because their computation and communication capabilities have drastically improved in recent years due to advances in semiconductor integration technologies that rely on Moore's Law. In addition to improving FPGA performance, toolchains for the development of FPGAs in OpenCL have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors that reduce the programming effort required. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose an OpenCL-enabled data movement method to directly access the global memory of the GPU and show how to implement cooperative GPU-FPGA computation using it. The results of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a latency of 0.59 μs and a data transfer rate as high as 7.0 GB/s between the GPU and the FPGA, thus confirming that it is effective at realizing high-performance cooperative GPU-FPGA computation.

AB  - Identifying DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) sites is of great significance in biological research, such as chromatin structure, DNA stability, DNA–protein interaction, and controlling gene expression. However, the traditional sequencing technology to identify 4mC sites is very time-consuming. In order to detect 4mC sites, we develop a multiview learning method for achieving more effectively via merging multiple feature spaces. Furthermore, we think about whether the multiview learning method can improve the across species classification ability by fusing data of multiple species. In our study, we propose a multiview Laplacian kernel sparse representation-based classifier, called MvLapKSRC-HSIC. First, we make use of three feature extraction methods [position-specific trinucleotide propensity, nucleotide chemical property, and DNA physicochemical properties) to extract the DNA sequence features. MvLapKSRC-HSIC uses a kernel sparse representation-based classifier with graph regularization. In order to maintain the independence between various views, we add a multiview regularization term constructed by Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). In the experiments, MvLapKSRC-HSIC is applied on six datasets, so as to compare with other popular methods in single-species and cross-species experiments. All experimental results show that MvLapKSRC-HSIC is superior to other outstanding methods on both single species and cross species. Importantly, MvLapKSRC-HSIC can identify a series of potential DNA 4mC sites, which have not yet been experimentally evaluate on multiple species and merit further research.

AB  - Understanding the I/O characteristics of applications on supercomputers is crucial to paving the path for application optimization and system resource allocation. We collect and analyze I/O traces of applications on a production supercomputer and reconfirm that I/O bursts exist in most applications. What's more, we find that the I/O bursts not only occur in short periods of time but also originate from a minority of adjacent compute nodes allocated to the applications, which we call spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. The concentration of I/O traffic in both time and space dimension will make applications experience poor I/O performance and incur I/O inefficiency of the storage system. Although there are some solutions, such as burst buffer, can help alleviate such inefficiency, there is still no work that measures, analyzes and further predicts the application I/O characteristic in terms of spatiotemporal burstiness, which we think is vital for application-aware optimizations, including but not limited to burst buffer allocation and job scheduling. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical model to measure the spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. Then a thorough analysis on the spatiotemporal I/O characteristic of all applications on the system is elaborated. We further make use of the job's submitting path to explore the I/O characteristic similarity among jobs, based on which a machine learning classification algorithm is proposed to accurately predict the job spatiotemporal I/O burstiness in advance. With accurate job I/O characteristic at hand, some useful suggestions are put forward to hedge the impacts of the spatiotemporal I/O burstiness.

AB  - Credit card fraud, although not directly impacting banks, does have repercussions for the financial sector as a whole. Criminals pose a significant threat to safety since they are continually thinking up new methods to commit these types of fraud. Early detection of fraudulent behavior is therefore vital to retain customer trust and defend the firm. Since lawful transactions far outnumber fraudulent transactions, which typically make up less than 1% of all transactions, addressing the class imbalance issue in the data presents a significant challenge for developing fraud detection algorithms. It is challenging to identify a positive example (fraudulent case), and this challenge increases as more data is gathered, leading to a lower proportion of positive examples. Because of this, research is very important. Models for making predictions were trained in this study utilizing a variety of sampling strategies, including the ANN, GBM, and the RF. Models used SMOTE, RUS, DBSMOTE, and SMOTE plus ENS were all examples of Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTEENN). This research suggests that SMOTE-based sampling techniques will provide positive results. The highest recall (0.81) was achieved by the SMOTE sampling method when a DRF classifier was used. It was determined that this classifier has an accuracy score of 0.87. The Stacked Ensembling algorithm was accomplished using altogether of collected data, and its average performance was 0.78, making it the clear winner. As a fraud detection model, the Stacked Ensemble has performed well in most sampling operations.

AB  - Dexterous robotic grasping gains great benefits from tactile sensation, but delicate object exploration by tactile information is challenged by difficulty in rich and efficient data production. In this letter, we propose a tactile-based in-hand object perception approach, empowered by a sim-to-real approach toward a data-efficient learning process. A high-fidelity tactile input, measured by a pair of vision-based tactile sensors, was represented as a point cloud facilitating dual functionality of object classification and the associated pose estimation. For the classification, we constructed PoinTacNet, a variation of PointNet to fit into tactile data processing. A reliable simulation methodology on tactile input was employed for the pretraining of the model, transferred to the fine-tuning process facing real tactile data. Taking inspiration from human behaviors, a re-grasping strategy was imparted by means of conditional accumulation of class likelihood distribution. The result of the framework facilitates a high object classification accuracy of 83.89$\%$ on the ten objects from McMaster-Carr's CAD models, which is significantly improved by the re-grasping. In addition, a set of benchmarks displays the computational efficiency in the sim-to-real transfer. In line with the successful classification, the posture of in-hand objects is estimated using point cloud registration algorithms, achieving an average angular and translational RMSE of 5.03$^\circ$ and 2.41 mm, respectively. The proposed approach has the potential to enable robots to attain human-like haptic exploration skills for perceiving unstructured environments.

AB  - Dealing with uncertainty is always a challenging problem, and different tools have been proposed to deal with it. Recently, a new model that is based on hesitant fuzzy sets has been presented to manage situations in which experts hesitate between several values to assess an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Hesitant fuzzy sets suit the modeling of quantitative settings; however, similar situations may occur in qualitative settings so that experts think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. In this paper, the concept of a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is introduced to provide a linguistic and computational basis to increase the richness of linguistic elicitation based on the fuzzy linguistic approach and the use of context-free grammars by using comparative terms. Then, a multicriteria linguistic decision-making model is presented in which experts provide their assessments by eliciting linguistic expressions. This decision model manages such linguistic expressions by means of its representation using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets.

AB  - Scene graph generation (SGG) and human-object interaction (HOI) detection are two important visual tasks aiming at localising and recognising relationships between objects, and interactions between humans and objects, respectively. Prevailing works treat these tasks as distinct tasks, leading to the development of task-specific models tailored to individual datasets. However, we posit that the presence of visual relationships can furnish crucial contextual and intricate relational cues that significantly augment the inference of human-object interactions. This motivates us to think if there is a natural intrinsic relationship between the two tasks, where scene graphs can serve as a source for inferring human-object interactions. In light of this, we introduce SG2HOI+, a unified one-step model based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach employs two interactive hierarchical Transformers to seamlessly unify the tasks of SGG and HOI detection. Concretely, we initiate a relation Transformer tasked with generating relation triples from a suite of visual features. Subsequently, we employ another transformer-based decoder to predict human-object interactions based on the generated relation triples. A comprehensive series of experiments conducted across established benchmark datasets including Visual Genome, V-COCO, and HICO-DET demonstrates the compelling performance of our SG2HOI+ model in comparison to prevalent one-stage SGG models. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art HOI methods. Additionally, we observe that our SG2HOI+ jointly trained on both SGG and HOI tasks in an end-to-end manner yields substantial improvements for both tasks compared to individualized training paradigms.

UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.

AB  - Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.

AB  - There is a growing literature demonstrating the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the process of learning computational thinking and the foundational aspects of computer science. While Collaborative Virtual Environments are becoming widespread in the software development professional domain and in various areas of advanced learning, their use in the introductory stages of learning computing is still very limited. On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a blooming of attractive programming environments specifically designed to expose young students (e.g., middle school age) to computational thinking. Alice is a very popular introductory programming environment, focused on programming through animations and story-telling. This paper introduces a novel extension of the Alice framework that enables interaction and collaboration among students in the development of programs. In particular, the new version of Alice described in this paper provides support for virtual pair programming. The modified version of Alice allows two students to remotely share a virtual world, and interact in its construction; the system supports roles assignments, to allow teachers to control activities and contributions of the two students in the creation of a programming project.

AB  - As the needs of education of programming language increase, the importance of the learning environment has been emphasized. Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. This paper introduces a block-based learning environment for C programming language using web services. The environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. The programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on.

AB  - In a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) etc. The rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board.

AB  - In this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a virtual reality (VR) based, flexibility learning environment (FLE) in which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of forces and Newton's laws of motion. The simulation/game modeling and making tasks acted as the primers of practicing and assessing representational flexibility in solving the engineering design problems with computational thinking. The participants' participation behaviors and verbal utterances during the intervention sessions have been archived via screen and webcam recordings. The current study findings indicated that two approaches of speech or text data mining, multi-label classification and similarity index, can act as the in-situ performance assessment methods to evaluate the representational flexibility development for engineering design and computational thinking of a heterogeneous learner group.

AB  - This research explores the psychology of programming and the pedagogical environment in a certificate granting urban immigrant engineer retraining program in New York City. The program is aimed at teaching under-represented immigrant engineer students to learn how to program in the Java programming language. The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research.

AB  - Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Learning representations is critical for machine learning and very computation-intensive process. There are many opportunities to introduce efficiencies through parallel and distributed computing. The success of machine learning algorithms depends on data representation. Different representations can expose or hide different features of the data. As we think about the future of learning representations and its impact on machine learning it is important to consider the state of the art of machine learning today, the challenges and opportunities for addressing the computation issues around representation learning, and how to get to deeper understanding and more capabilities in machine learned models. In this talk I will describe 4 ideas related to computational issues in representation learning: reducing uncertainty, developing compact representations, debasing the training data, and developing privacy-preserving representations.

Yet while much is written about how software is used, and the activities that it supports and shapes, thinking about software itself has remained largely technical for much of its history. Increasingly, however, artists, scientists, engineers, hackers, designers, and scholars in the humanities and social sciences are finding that for the questions they face, and the things they need to build, an expanded understanding of software is necessary. For such understanding they can call upon a strand of texts in the history of computing and new media, they can take part in the rich implicit culture of software, and they also can take part in the development of an emerging, fundamentally transdisciplinary computational literacy. These provide the foundation for Software Studies.

AB  - 6G is currently under definition, often being addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.

AB  - In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.

AB  - At present, conveyor belt tearing is the most serious fault of belt conveyor, causing the greatest loss. This paper aims to overcome the issues of poor accuracy, low precision, and poor real-time performance in the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor. Specifically, this paper presents a method of longitudinal tear detection of conveyor belt based on the sound signal. According to the recognition of the tearing sound signal, the longitudinal tearing of conveyor belt can be detected. A dynamic MFCC feature extraction method is proposed to extract the sound signal feature. An improved DenseNet neural network model is designed, which is used to classify the longitudinal sound of the belt conveyor to realize the longitudinal tearing detection of the conveyor belt.The experimental results demonstrate that the method in this paper achieves the sound detection of the longitudinal tear of the conveyor belt, and the average accuracy of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor reaches 95.42%, which satisfies the requirements of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor.Applying this method to the longitudinal tearing detection of conveyor belt can solve the shortcomings of existing methods and realize the detection of the longitudinal tearing fault of conveyor belt.

AB  - Accurate carbon price prediction can help save energy and reduce emissions worldwide. Thus, this paper proposes a model that combines swarm intelligence algorithms with deep learning to predict carbon prices. In this model, we collect news related to carbon trading, construct a dictionary of carbon financial sentiment, and determine the emotional value of the carbon news. Secondly, The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is improved by updating the escape energy and introducing the inertia weight. Then, the LSTM is optimized using the improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO) algorithm. Finally, technical and emotional data on carbon price as multiple source input values are integrated, and the MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model is established. The results show that the MAPE of IHHO-LSTM is 1.89%, 30.48%, and 10.30% better than that of HHO-LSTM in Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen Carbon Exchanges, respectively. Similarly, MS-IHHO-LSTM showed a lower MAPE than IHHO-LSTM by 27.79%, 29.82%, and 6.33% in the corresponding regions. The results of the experiment indicate that: 1) Using IHHO to optimize LSTM hyperparameters can avoid falling into local optimal and improve prediction accuracy; 2) Incorporating emotional values can further enhance the model’s performance. The MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model facilitates low-carbon investment, technological innovation, and green production, enabling enterprises to support environmental sustainability.

AB  - The complex environmental influences often complicate the detection of longitudinal tears in conveyor belts, resulting in insufficient detection accuracy, overlooked detection, and elevated false detection rates. In this study, we propose a new depth learning method specifically designed for detecting longitudinal tears in conveyor belts. This method employs a linear Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to capture images of the conveyor belt. These images are subsequently processed with a modified version of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v7 model to identify instances of longitudinal tearing. The modified YOLOv7 model features Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss function as a substitute for the original loss function. Furthermore, a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) is introduced in the detection head to improve detection accuracy. In this method, we introduced the SimSPPFCSPC module as a new spatial pyramid pooling model. This module enhances detection speed while maintaining detection accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an impressive precision of 94.6% and a detection speed of approximately 110 Frames Per Second (FPS). Such accuracy and speed meet the requirements for online detection of longitudinal tearing in belt conveyors.

AB  - The main challenge of pose estimation for six degrees of freedom (6DoF) is the lack of labeled data in real environment. In order to overcome this problem, many studies recently have trained deep learning models with synthetic data. However, a domain gap between real and synthetic environments exists, prompting various approaches to address this issue. In this work, we propose domain adaptation for self-supervised 6DoF pose estimation, which leverages the components and introduces an effective method to reduce domain discrepancy. First, we adopt a multi-level domain adaptation module, on image level and instance level, to learn domain-invariant features. Second, we used entropy-based alignment to minimize the entropy of representation embedding. Finally, we evaluate our approach on LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD datasets. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves higher performance compared to the prior methods and demonstrate effectiveness in domain shift scenarios on 6DoF pose estimation.

AB  - Data science and high-performance computing (HPC) should be a great match: with datasets growing well beyond the memory of a single node and computations becoming ever more communication-intensive, the need for HPC in data science seems clear. And yet, there remains a frustrating gap between the two disciplines. One major reason is that data science is an interactive sport-data scientists overwhelmingly gravitate towards interactive platforms (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) and interpreted languages (e.g., Python)-whereas the culture of HPC tends to eschew interactivity in favor of compiled programs and batch jobs. While HPC practitioners prize computational efficiency, data scientists live by the very different maxim of rapid hypothesis testing and have demonstrated that they are willing to ignore HPC technologies entirely rather than give up interactivity. Bridging this gap entails a change in thinking about the purpose of an HPC and how it should be used. This talk motivates and demonstrates the interactive use of up to hundreds of HPC nodes in data science workflows with an open-source package called Arkouda, which exposes massively parallel, distributed NumPy-like arrays to a Jupyter notebook running Python 3. We have chosen the NumPy format and Jupyter and Python as front-end technologies in order to conform to interfaces familiar to data scientists. Because Arkouda arrays can be constructed from and exported to NumPy arrays, users can perform heavy computations on hundreds of HPC nodes and bring back small sets of results for rich introspection in a single-node Python environment. In the future, we plan to use this interoperability as a template for bringing existing HPC codes into an interactive framework, much as NumPy has brought optimized C and Fortran routines into interactive Python workflows. Meanwhile, the computational heart of Arkouda is a relatively compact yet highly scalable Chapel interpreter that implements a powerful set of data science primitives. Functionally, this interpreter comprises a dispatcher, modular data transformations, and a zero-copy, in-memory object store, all implemented in about 12,000 lines of Chapel. While these components and design principles appear in other open-source projects, the competitive advantage of Arkouda comes from the unique position Chapel holds as a productive language with performance and scaling on par with industry-standard HPC technologies. For this reason, Arkouda is small enough to be maintainable while achieving good scaling on communication-intensive primitives (e.g., argsort) up to at least 512 nodes of a Cray XC.

AB  - As reproducible research tools and skills become increasingly in-demand across disciplines, so too does the need for innovative and collaborative training. While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.

AB  - Molecular programming of DNA makes use of computeraided design, a programming language to encode the design, and a a compiler that compiles the code into a list of corresponding DNA strands. To implement the code, the developer orders the DNA from a supplier and then runs the molecular program in the laboratory. Instruments such as spectrofluorometers and atomic force microscopes help verify that the molecular program ran correctly, self-assembling to achieve the intended structure and behavior. Applications of molecular programming that are on the horizon for commercial production include targeted and personalized medical applications, biosensors for air and water, molecular robots that can navigate in cells, and biocompatible computational devices. In this talk I describe the experiences and results of our interdisciplinary team in applying goal-oriented requirements techniques, reaction network modeling, and probabilistic model checking to molecular programmed nanosystems. Requirements challenges include handling scalability to very large numbers of devices or services (roughly similar to the internet of things), dealing with probabilistic behavior, and understanding the limits of safe operation in changing (literally fluid) environments. I discuss how computational tools and thinking assist the development efforts and what limitations currently hamper our requirements analysis in practice. More broadly, I suggest that the approaches useful for molecular programming may help with understanding the requirements for other large, distributed, autonomous systems.

AB  - Protein-DNA interactions play a critical role in many biological processes. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. DNA binding proteins can be classified into double-stranded DNA binding proteins (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). Understanding the binding specificity of a DNA binding protein is helpful for the research of protein functions. Though there are some researches [1] on the SSB and DSB respectively, few attentions have been paid on investigating what makes SSB and DSB have such different ability of the specific binding. With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of proteins has been sequenced. However, SSBs have shown to have little sequence conservation [2]. Even DSBs involved in similar functions may have conserved subsequences, different kinds of DSBs with different functions seems to show few common subsequences. Therefore, it is hard to recognize SSB sequences from DSB sequences, or vice versa. In fact, up to Jan. 25, 2013, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] contains 3391 structures for DNA binding proteins, among them only about 30% and 5% are annotated as DSBs and SSBs, respectively, and whether the remainders belong to DSBs or SSBs are still not very clear. Therefore, a computational method is required to annotate the DNA binding protein as DSB or SSB automatically. The surface of a protein is generally irregular, containing many clefts and grooves of varying shapes and sizes. Previous researches have shown that a large cleft can provide an increased opportunity for the protein to form interactions with other molecules, particularly small ligands [4]. Therefore, some researches used a particularly large and deep cleft to characterize the binding active sites of the proteins [5]. We guess that for DNA binding proteins, the cleft properties on the surface may also play important roles on the dsDNA/ssDNA binding specificity. In this work, we applied CAVER 3.0 package [6] to detect the clefts and the corresponding indexes of the largest clefts on the protein surfaces, to investigate whether they are possible to be used for distinguishing the potential interfaces between SSBs and DSBs. Concretely, we mainly got three indexes of the detected tunnels: length, curvature and bottleneck radius. Research results have shown that although the sequences of different SSBs are very different, there are well-conserved elements in the structures. That is, most SSBs contain one or more OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) - fold domains [2]. A typical OB-fold has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The OB-fold plays critical role in binding with ssDNA. Although it is hard to say that the OB-fold is unique for SSBs, we think that it should also be used as an important descriptor to distinguish SSBs from DSBs. Therefore, we use the protein structure alignment package TM-align [7] to compare its structure with each of the six OB-fold protein templates and use the maximal alignment score TM-score as the OB-fold feature of the protein. We aim to investigate the structural differences between collected SSBs and DSBs, and extract the structure-based features related to surface clefts and OB-folds, Based on which, we construct a computational model that can automatically classify the DNA protein as a DSB or SSB by using the widely used support vector machine (SVM), with prediction accuracy of HOLO-set 0.87, APO-set 0.83, and mixed-set 0.83, respectively. The promising performance suggests that our method will be useful in the protein function annotation and refinement.

AB  - In the field of storytelling and filmmaking, we are often aware of the viewer's subjective state, such as emotional state and so on. A similar concept is direction, which is often accumulated by the heuristic findings of creators. The issue is that the emotional state of the viewer is subjective, making it hard for computational approach. Our approach is utilizing appraisal trajectory. The appraisal trajectory is a line chart drawn the viewer's own emotional state from the beginning to the end of the content. We think that the appraisal trajectory enables us to handle the viewer's emotional state with a computer. We think to need accumulate basic findings about subjective trajectories; therefore, we develop a tool to collect subjective trajectories: emonotate. This tool provides some features: input and store the various emotional states of viewers and viewers intuitively agreeable input by visual feedback of arbitrary appraisal trajectories. In order to evaluate the validity, we conduct the experiment of 104 participants drawing subjective trajectories based on protagonist emotional state about 2 animation contents and the subjective quantity is the protagonist emotional state. Both works yielded intuitively correct results, demonstrating the realism of our tool. We think our experimental facts indicate the possibility of our tool collecting subjective trajectories and the issues.

AB  - This paper purports to share with the higher education community the global PBL active learning curriculum and the learning environment, which have been collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University (KU). The collaborated universities developed an optimal curriculum to enhance and nurture students' "Future Work Skills 2020" defined by the Institute for the Future, such future human skills as Sense Making, Social Intelligence, Novel & Adaptive Thinking, Cross-Cultural Competencies, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, Transdisciplinarity, Design Mindset, Cognitive Load Management, and Virtual Collaboration. The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on "the same page" in the progress of the project throughout the course. Further, the assessment strategies to enhance students' efficacy is the key factor in the course, which is also discussed with examples. This paper reports the global PBL active learning curriculum and environment collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University.

AB  - Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.

AB  - Nowadays, there has been a rapid evolution and transformation of technology. Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.
