AB  - The objective of this work is focused on the definition of a methodology for the development of computational thinking and the subsequent measurement of the development obtained in the students. The methodological proposal includes specific tasks or activities to develop computational thinking as well as tests that allow analyzing the extent to which computational thinking or skills related to problem solving have been developed in a scientific, specific, or even general or of practical application in situations of daily life. Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others.

AB  - Nowadays, the ability to code is becoming increasingly important in industry and is often mentioned as a crucial skill for future employment. In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.

AB  - For the last two decades, the world of pre-academic and academic education has been occupied with ways of developing computational thinking. Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students' learning processes are discussed, reflecting the students' multi-faceted and deep engagement in the MOOC.

AB  - The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.

AB  - Block-oriented programming environments, such as Scratch and AppInventor, have become mainstream and have helped introduce non-programmers to algorithmic thinking; that is, to computational thinking (CT) skills. In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties - that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects - can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received increasing attention from educational researchers as a higher-order thinking skill. CT is a key factor that influences the learning process and facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and the improvement of students’ academic performance. However, the mechanisms of how CT affects students’ academic performance have yet to be explored in depth. Based on this, this study used a large-scale questionnaire to construct a model with problem-solving ability and learning anxiety as mediators with 8,134 Chinese elementary school students. The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement. CT can improve students’ problem-solving ability and reduce anxiety, which leads to better academic performance.

The activity is part of a doctoral research aimed at promoting programming skills and computational thinking through robotics in the early stages of school. In the formative experience participated teachers and students of pre-school education from a school in Salamanca, Spain, during the academic year 2016-2017. The proposed activities were based on solving problems through programming challenges with the Bee-Bot® robot. In order to collect data, questionnaires, rubrics, field diaries and interviews were used. The results show teachers and students favorably accepted the robotics resource used and the learning activities. In the same way, the performance achieved by the students marked a favorable level according to the evaluation scale used. Therefore, the development of the pilot experience was effective and useful in strengthening the research activities that were subsequently carried out.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) concept is a problem-solving approach that includes logical ordering, analyzing data and preparing solutions with the help of different visualization tools like flowcharts, graphs, pie charts etc. CT is not just used by computer programmer, but it can also be used by students and teachers in any classroom so that teaching learning process becomes successful. CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.

Traditional teaching can no longer meet the needs of modern education, and the teaching reform of information technology courses is imperative. Therefore, this article proposes to apply gamification teaching to information technology courses to increase students’ interest in learning and cultivate students’ computational thinking, that is, the ability to use the basic concepts of computer science to solve complex problems. This article takes the secondary vocational information technology course as an example to study the specific application of gamification teaching, and proposes a case of “Gobang Game” to provide a reference for the implementation of gamification teaching.

AB  - This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.

AB  - Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.

AB  - STEAM education has been paid much attention currently for fostering the interdisciplinary thinking abilities. However, the current learning content of STEAM almost focuses on the learning of STEM subjects and the cultivation of the Computational Thinking (CT), so the learning of ART subject is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Scheme of STEAM Interactive Learning Toy for Musical Thinking (MT) and Computational Thinking (ILT-MCT), to engage primary level elementary students in learning knowledge and concepts of the MT and CT both. In ILT-MCT scheme, children read the paper-based learning content (learning book) to learn the concepts of MT and CT, interact with a Mobile-based learning toy using substantial Programming Blocks, and further play the digital game-based learning content via the learning toy to enhance the learning motivation.

AB  - Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.

AB  - The use of video scenarios is an active learning approach designed to aid in the development of computational and entrepreneurial thinking skills. Video scenarios present problems in the context of lifelike settings in order to emphasize the complexity as well as creative potential presented by problems which are diverse, multi-layered and frequently ill-defined. Students must carefully observe and critically listen to the characters in the videos in order to understand the problems they are experiencing. Through discussion, design or implementation, students explore potential ways in which computing can be used to help the characters solve their problems. The approach is designed to develop creative problem solving skills, while also encouraging students to view themselves as capable of entrepreneurship and innovation in computing. The videos are freely available on the website www.virt-u.org, and can be used for a wide range of learning activities.

AB  - With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.

AB  - For students majored in computer science, the ability to have computational thinking is an essential skill. Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts. This study takes the software engineering course as an example to explain how to integrate the concepts of computational thinking into the original courses. The goal is to enable students to understand software engineering contents problems from the perspective of problem-solving.

AB  - Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.

AB  - With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, Scratch has risen in prominence for its thinkable, meaningful and social. Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.

AB  - In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.

AB  - Computational thinking is the systematic approach of defining a problem and crafting its solution. It employs computer programming algorithms to address scientific, engineering, and mathematical challenges using programming languages. Feedback plays a pivotal role in the learning journey of computational thinking. It is widely recognized that offering timely feedback to students on their computational endeavors significantly contributes to their achievement and overall satisfaction with the course. This research explores the implementation of an automated feedback system designed to evaluate and offer early feedback on computer engineering projects. The aim is to integrate best practices and software tools related to computational thinking into the thinking and learning processes within an engineering curriculum. Preliminary findings suggest that the automated feedback system enhances students' computational skills and improves their performance in the course. We anticipate that the insights gained from this research will inform the enhancement of curricula and course evaluations across different computational thinking tasks, disciplines, and courses.

AB  - This Work-in-Progress study focuses on computational thinking (CT) in children. Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are currently underrepresented in STEM education and careers. However, providing appropriate early CT learning opportunities can potentially help learners develop both interest and self-efficacy in computer science and STEM fields.Our research aims to characterize computational thinking and engineering thinking for K-2 aged children. In this paper, we report on our findings of children exploring a recently installed exhibit at a local Midwestern science center. The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.

AB  - This Research to practice work in progress paper explores teachers' experiences about a professional development program focused on discipline-based computational thinking (CT). The goal of the program is to integrate computational practices into disciplinary learning environments at the K-12 level in Colombia. To promote this integration and to explore teachers' conceptions and possible scenarios to integrate CT in this context, the research team designed, implemented, and assessed a 20-hour professional development program with 21 teachers from public middle and high schools in Antioquia, Colombia. The program introduced the concepts and practices of CT and discussed why these are relevant for students to learn. A use-modify-create instructional sequence was used as the pedagogical approach to scaffold participants' learning process. At the end of the workshop, the teachers completed a survey regarding their experience in the program. Preliminary results indicate that the participating teachers increased their knowledge and interest to integrate computational thinking practices into their disciplinary learning environments.

AB  - Computational Thinking was an important way to study computer science and it explained the relationships between human, calculation and computer in terms of thinking. The computer science was raised from the theory of tools to the height of thinking. This paper introduced three levels of Computational Thinking: Computational Thinking in computer science, Computational Thinking in computing science and Computational Thinking in all subjects and analyzed the thinking characteristic of calculation and the calculation attribute of thinking. Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics. The paper thought the goal of teaching was not to learn knowledge itself, but to form problem solving thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT)., considered to be one of the three major scientific thinking styles of human beings., is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner.

AB  - The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.

The college students have not only basic skills in computer operation but also certain programming skills. Those who understand and practice computational thinking will solve various non-universal computing problems encountered in work and study in the contemporary information society. In order to support the teaching objectives and educational concepts of the new engineering discipline, teaching reforms have been carried out in terms of teaching objectives, teaching content, teaching models, teaching resources, and ideological and political education. We cultivate interdisciplinary and professional integration through advanced thinking methods. It integrates knowledge points into practical engineering applications and cultivates students' computational thinking ability. It also improves the practical application and problem-solving abilities of students. In addition, we integrate ideological and political elements into the teaching process. It is a teaching method that combines moral education and professional courses.

AB  - The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.

AB  - As a fundamental and introductory course in undergraduate education, Computer Basis aims to cultivate the scientific computational thinking mode and the ability of solving problem for students who are not the computer majors. In this study, a new pedagogical method named PBL-VP combining the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and the visual programming Blockly was applied to Computer Basis. This paper described a classical example about problem solving to explain the teaching process of the PBL-VP in detail. The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education.

Combining the top two open-source data science tools, Python (within Jupyter notebooks) and R (within R studio software), we illustrate some of results from data preprocessing (cleaning, wrangling) for the diagnostic primary-school test of inquiry skills where Python tools (e.g. Pandas library) became more advantageous. As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are still collecting data from ITA project impacts for which we finally show how we plan to implement further methods for data collecting, analysis and implementation in collaboration with our colleagues - education researchers.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper details a design-based research approach for implementing computational learning activities in a first-year engineering physics course. This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design.

AB  - The role of computing in society is fundamental for the political, economic and cultural development of countries, especially in a globalized context. Computational thinking is an extremely important skill in the education of young students, since the ability of intuitively abstracting information and knowledge promotes an expansion of the learning dimension. This study aims to gather approaches used for teaching computational thinking exclusively to high school students, highlighting their performance and motivation resulting from the applications of such approaches. In order to answer our research question, a systematic mapping of the analysis of 15 studies was conducted. The use of computer programming proved to be the most used way to disseminate computational thinking.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), problem-solving and programming skills are important for the students with major of computer education of higher levels education which related to the computing science contents. The instructions must provide the basic contents and learning activities, including Internet of Things (IoT), big-data and programming, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. However, these courses present learning difficulties based upon the students' individual skills. Development and integration of the IoT system would offer supporting tools for learning activities and improve the students' computational thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills. This paper presents the design and development of IoT system to support students' computational thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills training through block-based programming and integrated platforms. The IoT system comprises three layers (hardware, middleware, and applications), using existing platforms and devices as well as newly developed. To validate the viability of the proposed pipelined realization, the developed systems were implemented for higher education level students of computer education program. The students' computational-thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills were significantly improved through the proposed learning system throughout the course.

But these technologies are usually developed by people removed from the daily realities of fieldwork. This paper explores the need and the possibilities of educating rural populations and social workers on the use of technology to create their own digital artifacts. We discuss two workshops, one for villagers in the state of Telangana and the second one for graduate students of a university social work department exploring the use of MIT's Scratch software as a tool for assisting in social interventions. We also discuss the results of an acceptability study among the social work students to gauge the potential for such a tool to be used in the field.

AB  - Computational thinking has recently been widely recognized as a fundamental skill that should be cultivated for everyone and in every field. Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.

The approach is independent of programming languages and uses a generic abstract syntax tree and projects’ metadata to calculate metrics, and establish relationships between measures, school regions, educational centers, and student groups. The research relates source code analysis using abstract syntax trees to some of the main computational thinking concepts. Preliminary results obtained using the proposed method are presented and discussed.

AB  - The Asia-Pacific region has been dominating the global video game market for years. In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning.

For this purpose, a quasi-experiment with 52 children of two elementary schools located in Lima, Peru was performed. The obtained results were statistically significant showing that the experimental group, comprised with the students who were trained with the Yupana improved their CT compared to the control group, in which the students kept doing their regular activities. This highlights the fact that using this ancestral math tool could serve as an instrument to develop the CT in children.

AB  - The era of big data witnesses that ‘computing’ has become an indispensable tool for medical development in many aspects of medicine domain. The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.

AB  - Assembly language is a foundation courses for science and technology of computers. Computational thinking emphasizes just like computer scientists thinking. It is one of basic skills to solve problems with the computer technology. How to develop student's computational thinking is an urgent question in computer education. This paper analyzes the connotation of computational thinking, the embodiment of ability in assembly language and the process of formation; then proposes teaching programs of assembly language for computational thinking. In 2009 and 2010, cross-teaching experiments have been adopted between teachers and students. The feedback information from students shows that the introduction of computational thinking computing can help students to improve the professional ability. The teaching reform has achieved good results.

AB  - Computational thinking has become a interesting subject and important concept in education throughout the nation. Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.

AB  - Identifying engaging programming tasks to teach computational thinking and programming skills, especially to students of post-secondary education, is a challenging problem for lecturers. Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented. Preliminary pilot deployment sessions of T{h}inker for both teachers and students confirm its potential as an effective tool for both teaching and learning of thinking skills.

AB  - Complex problem solving is one of the key skills for future jobs, but it has not been clearly operationalized. We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.

AB  - Promoting the computational thinking of the K12 students through artificial intelligence education is reflected in curriculum standards and academic research. Game-based learning promotes the learning interest and motivation, helps students reinforce computational thinking practices. Based on the input-process-result (IPO) game-based learning model, this study integrated the artificial intelligence instructional content, game-based learning, and the core elements of computational thinking practice to design game-based learning activities that was suitable for promoting computational thinking practices in artificial intelligence courses. In this research, the artificial intelligence course “Challenging Tic-Tac-Toe” was conduct in senior high school. The results showed that the game-based learning in artificial intelligence courses could help students to master artificial intelligence subject knowledge, significantly improved the computational thinking practices, enhanced learning interest, motivation, self-confidence, and reduce cognitive load. Thus, this study provides additional evidence that using the game-based learning strategies is an effective learning method that improves both learning performance and computational thinking practices.

AB  - This work-in-progress paper will explore the effectiveness of topic modeling to support the analysis of Colombian teachers' conceptions of computational thinking (in Spanish) in an online professional development program. Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill that is not only confined to computer scientists’ activities but can be widely applied in daily life and is required in order to adapt to the future and, therefore, should be taught at early ages. Within this framework, assessing CT is an indispensable part to consider in order to introduce CT in the school curricula. Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students. The BCTt design is considered adequate by experts and results show a high reliability for the assessment of CT in Primary School, particularly in first educational stages.

AB  - Context In many countries, it is now important to integrate learning-oriented views to foster computational thinking (CT) in the classroom. This has inspired ideas for new lesson plans, instructional strategies, teacher guidance, and, most importantly, new approaches to grading these skills. Aim: This article presents the results of a systematic review initially focused on identifying the various ways of assessing CT in school and their relationship to relevant CT skills. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works. Conclusions: The evaluation of CT in the school requires multiple approaches; it is a challenge to have a single method or strategy to evaluate everything that CT implies.

AB  - Currently we see globalization and technological advances accelerating worldwide, transforming the world of work and human coexistence. We still notice that the educational systems, in their majority, are disconnected from these global realities. In this sense, it is necessary to have an educational formation more aligned to the contemporary world, preparing young people for the challenges of the 21st century, how to deal with technological resources and processes, developing soft and hard skills. In this way, it can be observed that in recent years computational thinking has gained relevance in this scenario, being a field of research in the most varied areas of knowledge, developing communication skills, creativity, leadership, problem solving, familiarity with technologies, management, transforming young people into autonomous individuals who are prepared for the technological changes that the world requires. Taking these transformations as a reference, this paper describes/presents the development of an online tool to stimulate computational thinking in elementary school, through online games. he use of the ThinkinGame makes it possible to identify the pillars to be worked on with young people, after its use, thus improving the approaches to be given in the formation of these young people, being able to turn attention to the challenge of teaching additional skills, such as sophisticated thinking and flexible problem solving.

AB  - Computing in schools has gained momentum in the last two years resulting in GCSEs in Computing and teachers looking to up skill from Digital Literacy (ICT). For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly "computational thinking", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino.

AB  - There are several software companies that develop several products. Are all of them used? Even after software companies following Agile framework methodology to develop their software's, many software's still fail to meet the requirements and eventually customers end up not using them. This is usually because the software teams fail to completely understand the user requirements. Agile framework and Design Thinking framework can be used together to gain customer empathy and to overcome this problem. This study discusses how Agile framework and Design Thinking supports the same principles and can be used to reduce software development failures. A Flashcard application was developed to validate Agile framework Design Thinking framework. The results are discussed in the validation and result section.

Lots of these initiatives, however, have been conceived to address the shortage of professionals in the technology sector, an approach that is encouraged by the software industry. On the contrary, this article argues that the focus should swift towards computational thinking, an ability that goes far beyond computer science or technology, fostering fundamental skills for the citizens of the twenty-first century. In this paper we summarize the findings of recent investigations that study computational thinking from different perspectives, explaining what this new skill is made of, presenting outcomes of school interventions showing relationships between the development of this ability and improvements in different subjects and soft skills, presenting technologies to foster its development, and reviewing tools that support educators in the assessment of this skill.

AB  - In this work we, study the self-efficacy of the use of the Choreographe software in block programming using the NAO robot in order to develop instructional videos in the classroom within the framework of Computational Thinking. The put forward objectives were three; (1) Evaluate the level of significance of self-efficacy and the applicability of CT concepts. (2) Measure the relationship between the applicability of CT concepts with the ease of use, usefulness, attitude and intention to work in the future with an instructional program. (3) Establish the percentages and means of the items of the variables concepts CT and self-efficacy. Thus, from a quantitative approach, we propose to create a questionnaire to measure self-efficacy and the level of knowledge acquired in block programming. 4 practical workshops of 2 hours each have been carried out with 28 initial training students between the ages of 23 and 27. The results yielded a positive correlation between the variables self-efficacy and computational thinking. Highlighting a positive acceptance of self-efficacy in the use of Choreographe software in the block programming experience and a growing ascendancy of interaction.

AB  - Programming robots playing with the environment is an ongoing research project aimed at developing a robot and intervention program capable of enhancing young children's cognitive abilities and computational thinking skills. Using a robot sensitive to color and distance, children are able to use everyday objects in order to interact with it and program its movements. An eleven session intervention program using this robot was designed with the objective of creating playful learning instances were children would practice abilities associated with what is generally thought of as computational thinking. We'll assess children's computational thinking, fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, number recognition and magnitude comparison, vocabulary, mental rotation, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility to test for cognitive effects of the intervention. An active control in which children interact with the robot by remotely controlling it was used.

AB  - In this study, the authors develop an iOS software “n-Queens Problem for Education” and discuss its application in the promotion of computational thinking. As it has already been pointed out in [1] and [2], playing games and solving puzzles are effective in cultivating computational thinking, and our gaming software can be a good tool to cultivate skills regarding “Generalization (Pattern Recognition),” “Abstraction;' and “Algorithms” of computational thinking. Our software “n-Queens Problem for Education” is based on the well-known “The n-Queens Puzzle,” which involves solving a puzzle of placing eight chess queens on an n × n chessboard so that they do not attack one another. This puzzle is a good way for students to learn computational thinking. Since this software shows the queens' moves and evaluates solutions, you can concentrate on using your brain without writing down the moves or erasing wrong solutions. In addition, this software has features such as the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board that help users study their solutions.

AB  - With the wide use of computers, how to make students understand the special way of thinking of computer science and find the appropriate methods to solve problems in their own fields like computer scientists are the challenges for educators. This paper proposed a computational thinking model based on blended learning Mctbbl and a descending dimension method for problem-space transformation. The Mctbbl model analyzes and researches the application of computational thinking in computer science by the organic combination of computational thinking and blended learning in a life-cycle perspective. On one hand, the model can summarize the core concepts and important principles in computer science and extract the typical thoughts and general methods of solving problems; on the other hand, the model can implement the teaching and learning of computational thinking by means of blended learning. Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply. The Mctbbl prolongs the study life cycle which takes preview as beginning, teacher-student discussion as body and practical application as core to ensure integrity, endurance and consistency of teaching.

AB  - In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.

AB  - In the age of Artificial Intelligence, the status of C++ Education Program in China's general high schools is somewhat embarrassing. On one hand, the programming training courses targeted K-12 students have been a big industry; on the other hand, the four editions of the current National High School Information Technology Curriculum textbooks are all in python. Based on the teaching experience of frontline teachers who have been teaching in general high schools for 18 years and the analysis of China's latest curriculum standards and core literacy requirements in information technology, this paper explores how general high schools can achieve sustainable C++ education program. At the curriculum level, combining the characteristics of C++ and students' developmental needs, two series of courses are formed: the General Studies Series and the Competition Series, the General Studies Series feature "wide range of content" and "real problem-driven"; the Competition Series featuring "deep" and "classic problems of computer science algorithms". At the teaching level, putting "problem understanding", "algorithm design", "algorithm experimentation and analysis" and "algorithm thinking communication" at the core of teaching practice, in stages and according to the types of students, differential teaching strategies are adopted, attaching importance to the problem context design and algorithm design, and emphasizing the process of "computational thinking" of the students. Only based on the all-round development of students' individuality, adjusting the curriculum and teaching, can the C++ Programming Education of ordinary high school be sustainable.

Student dropout rate in computer science is the highest among college majors. Educators are striving to find a way to teach efficiently and effectively the technical and the problem solving skills students need. In this paper we will be studying the effects of syntax exercises on a subject's ability to think computationally and precisely. We tested our process on professionals and students. Half of the professionals were in the computer science field and half of our students did syntax exercises. The other half of professionals and students had no exposure to syntax to compare. Our purpose is to find if teaching students syntax exercises are still relevant and can teach both technical and computational thinking skills.

AB  - In this pilot study we created and evaluated a new version of the TechCheck Computational Thinking (CT) assessment designed specifically for kindergarten students. The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy.

AB  - The development of computer science has led to an increase in programming education for younger people. Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.

AB  - Programming education will be compulsory in elementary schools in Japan from 2020, but it is still little information on how to measure the effects of lessons conducted for students. In this study, to measure objectively and quantitatively the educational effect of programming education, we developed 30 quizzes of measuring the ability of computational thinking. In this paper, focusing on the programming experience of college students and above, we confirmed the measurable ability using these quizzes.

AB  - BlockPy is a block-based program language which has both block-based interface and traditional text-based interface. It fills the gap between block-based programming and language coding. But there is little work that focuses on the Computational Thinking(CT) evaluation of BlockPy programs. In this paper, we design and implement a BlockPy Analysis Tool to assess the CT skills of BlockPy programs automatically. We use Python's built-in AST module to analyse each node in the abstract syntax tree(AST) of each BlockPy program. Then, considering the characteristics of Python language, we propose a new CT Evaluation Criteria based on Scratch Analysis Tool(SAT). Under the guidance of the CT Evaluation Criteria, we propose a detailed scoring program to analyze each node of the program and get the CT score. Experimental results show the superiority of our tool compared with other analysis tools.

AB  - Thinking skills training can effectively improve students' creative thinking and learning ability, and it is simple, practical and feasible. Now there are lots of educators and teachers who have done some researches in this area. But many controversial problems still exist, for example, whether thinking is needed to be taught, how to be taught, etc. This paper first discusses the necessity and connotation of thinking skills training, and discusses the trainability of thinking skills, then designs a course framework based on Edward de Bono's thinking training system and Tony Buzan's mind map, and chooses teaching thinking directly as an effective way to teach thinking skills. At last, we introduce the practice of the course framework in Beijing Normal University. Constructing a practical course framework of training thinking and putting it into practice are the innovations of this paper.

AB  - Research studies provide some evidence that computing and education robotics have a positive impact on female students' engagement in Computational Thinking (CT) practices and their self-efficacy for CT. Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms.

AB  - ChatGPT has received considerable attention in education, particularly in programming education because of its capabilities in automated code generation and program repairing and scoring. However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.
