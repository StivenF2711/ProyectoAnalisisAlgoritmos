AB  - Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.

AB  - Increased data availability has stimulated the interest in studying sports prediction problems via analytical approaches; in particular, with machine learning and simulation. We characterize several models that have been proposed in the literature, all of which suffer from the same drawback: they cannot incorporate rational decision-making and strategies from teams/players effectively. We tackle this issue by proposing hybrid simulation logic that incorporates teams as agents, generalizing the models/methodologies that have been proposed in the past. We perform a case study on the NBA with two goals: i) study the quality of predictions when using only one predictive variable, and ii) study how much historical data should be kept to maximize prediction accuracy. Results indicate that there is an optimal range of data quantity and that studying what data and variables to include is of extreme importance.

AB  - Conceptual architecture involves a highly creative exploration of novel ideas, often taken from other disciplines as architects consider radical new forms, materials, textures and colors for buildings. While today's generative AI systems can produce remarkable results, they lack the creativity demonstrated for decades by evolutionary algorithms. SCAPE, our proposed tool, combines evolutionary search with generative AI, enabling users to explore creative and good quality designs inspired by their initial input through a simple point and click interface. SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT -4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL. E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just three iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization of images by users. We use more than 20 independent architects to assess SCAPE, who provide markedly positive feedback.

AB  - At this stage of development of science in the world raises the question of new methods for solving optimisation and a large number of applications, i.e. the creation of innovative solutions. This article analyses the state of science in the direction of innovation solutions for different problems. In scope of the article the possibility of creative computing and type-variety principle in different fields of knowledge is described with the review of literature. The goal is to obtain new results with higher quality while combining those two knowledges. Universality of diversity concept, described type-variety principle, understanding it as a tool for creating a new way for solving problems (as a tool for the formation innovation solutions) and the breadth of its application provide a basis to identify and define it as the fundamental principle of contemporary applied systems analysis. Type-variety principle explains the importance of various interdisciplinary levels and appears to be the root and active source of solution innovations.

AB  - Gender bias creates inequalities in roles, expectations, and opportunities between males and females. When such biases are incorporated into artificial intelligence models, the corresponding technological solutions and products can further entrench the social biases. Herein, a new method for investigating the extent to which latent biases in text-based training data affect a language model is presented. Potential gender bias is identified by deriving values assigned to male/female words via inverse operations from embedded expressions to the original words using the approximate inverse model explanation (AIME). In particular, AIME constructs approximate generalized inverse operators for black-box models. A biased embedded representation used in machine learning models as an internal representation of word/sentence vectors likely introduces bias into the overall prediction results of such models. The OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 large language model, which provides embedded expressions, is employed to determine the gender bias included in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the OpenAI textembedding-ada-002 model is partially gender-biased owing to the training text data. These results are expected to (i) contribute to the development of effective measures preventing gender bias during the design and training of language models, (ii) promote the identification and mitigation of gender bias in future language models, and (iii) provide insights into the effect of language models and their limitations from technical, social, and cultural perspectives.

AB  - People experience many stressful, emotion-evoking situations in everyday life. How they cope with these situations is crucial to their well-being. Research shows that people may change their beliefs to perceive the situations in a better, less-stressful light. Therefore, understanding how people change their beliefs to cope with stress and emotion is an important research question. Toward that end, we model coping, based on Lazarus's appraisal theory of emotion, as a two-step decision problem. However, people do not hallucinate arbitrary alternative realities in order to reduce stress. So a central challenge here is to model the constraints on belief change. We specifically stipulate two key factors influencing the degree of belief change: the utility of holding the alternative belief and constraints on changing a belief based on its underlying uncertainty. To investigate these factors and the model's assumptions, we applied the model to a simple hurricane situation and conducted an experiment based on this situation, where participants observed hurricane information and reported their beliefs about it. We found that when the hurricane worsens, those who stayed believe the hurricane to be less severe than the most likely outcome from the information and those who evacuated. The results also show that the uncertainty of information and the utility of the beliefs about that information is related and together determine how emotion-focused coping alters the person's beliefs. Overall, the results support the assumptions and predictions of the model. These findings illustrate the relevance of applying a decision-making model analysis to coping.

AB  - In the era of "Internet plus Education", precise ideological and political education is a key subject for higher education and an important indicator of contemporary college students’ education evaluation. The precise evaluation of ideological and political education focuses on the multi-source collection of teaching evidence throughout the entire process, emphasizing the multidimensional evaluation and measurement of the teaching process and its effectiveness, and providing new ideas for learning evaluation. This article draws on the ideas of teaching evaluation and combines the characteristics of the integration of online and offline precise ideological and political education. From the process of "individual student modeling learning value precise ideological and political evaluation", a multi-source data representation model is established; A multi-source data fusion method for precise evaluation of ideological and political education has been established from three levels: behavior, cognition, and communication; Furthermore, a multi-source data fusion evaluation system based on Kalman filtering algorithm was proposed, which includes four stages: data acquisition, data association, data fusion, interpretation, and decision-making. Through empirical research, it has been found that in a precise ideological and political evaluation system, multi-source data from online teaching platform logs, classroom teaching videos, learning performance and effectiveness can accurately evaluate the types and performance of students’ ideological and political learning engagement, and have a good prediction of the status of ideological and political learning engagement.

AB  - New demands for Computer Science education arise in response to changing models of computing provision, in which earlier models of computing `as a product' are being superseded by models of computing `as a service'. Typical names for this shift are service-oriented computing or services computing. Both academic and industry sectors of computing are reacting to this trend in differing ways. This article provides an insight into the development of an undergraduate major in service science and a masters programme in service-oriented computing at the AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand, and an overview of the service computing offerings in the New Zealand market. We also provide an insight into the considerations that take place in developing new university programmes, the unique dialog that is part of a university programme approval process in New Zealand and the arguments our proposal received from other universities. We will also compare how these programmes relate to the proposed curriculum reference models for Service Computing. This in turn has lead to the establishment of a specialist Service Science Innovation Research group.

AB  - This study analyzes the process of online pedagogical mediation in a Distance Education undergraduate Pedagogy course based on the students’ perception of the learning experience in a virtual learning environment (VLE). Online pedagogical mediation is understood in this study as an educational and communicational process that aims at collective and collaborative construction of knowledge involving multiple mediators (human and non-human). To analyze this process, the community of inquiry (CoI) theoretical model played a central role in our study, especially in the interaction between online pedagogical mediation and the elements that constitute this model, considered interdependent and crucial for a successful higher educational experience: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. Data was collected with a questionnaire survey, which allowed us to identify the student’s conception of online pedagogical mediation and to assess the perception on the development of the presences of the CoI model in the pedagogical mediation used in the course VLE. The results suggest that most students share the perception that online pedagogical mediation is related to the role played by teachers and tutors. Regarding student’s perception of the learning experience, the results show that they positively perceive the development of the presences of the model, while also suggesting aspects of the online pedagogical mediation process that can be improved, aiming at the constitution of a community of inquiry more focused and effective in the development of learning.

AB  - No system in the real world can compute an appropriate response in reaction to every situation it encounters, or even most situations it is likely to encounter. Biological systems address this issue with four strategies: (1) a repertoire of already computed responses tied to a situation recognition process, (2) organized in a response-time hierarchy that allows a quick response to occur immediately, and one or more slower and more deliberate responses to begin at the same time, with (3) decision processes that allow one of them to take over after a little while, or that (4) merge several of them in a combined and possibly novel response. In this paper, we describe an approach to building self-adaptive computing systems that incorporates these strategies, to cope with their intended use in hazardous, remote, unknown, or otherwise difficult environments, in which it is known a priori that the system cannot keep up with all important events, and that “as fast as possible” is not appropriate for some interactions. The key to implementing these strategies is an abstraction/refinement hierarchy of behavioral models and processes at multiple levels of granularity and precision. The key to coordinating these different models is the collection of integrative mappings among them, which are developed along with the models, and used for managing system behavior. We also describe the system development process that we use to build such systems, which differs from conventional methods by taking the basic artifacts of development, considered as partial models of aspects of the system in its environment, and retains them all in a model hierarchy, which eventually becomes the definition of the run time system. We show how to implement such systems, explain why we think they are good candidates for real-time operational environments, and illustrate the method with an example implementation.

AB  - Recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have provided us with neural networks capable of creating images of astonishing quality, be they realistic, abstract, or even creative. These models have in common that (more or less explicitly) they all aim to produce a high-quality one-off output given certain conditions, and in that they are not well suited for a creative collaboration framework. Drawing on theories from cognitive science that model how professional designers and artists think, we argue how this setting differs from the former and introduce CICADA: a Collaborative, Interactive Context-Aware Drawing Agent. CICADA uses a vector-based synthesis-by-optimisation method to take a partial sketch (such as might be provided by a user) and develop it towards a goal by adding and/or sensibly modifying traces. Given that this topic has been scarcely explored, we also introduce a way to evaluate desired characteristics of a model in this context by means of proposing a diversity measure. CICADA is shown to produce sketches of quality comparable to a human user’s, enhanced diversity and most importantly to be able to cope with change by continuing the sketch minding the user's contributions in a flexible manner.

AB  - Historic settlements have adapted to the local climate and geographical environment accommodating residents over the years. Rich and precious scientific design concepts, including the site selection, the layout, and the building materials, should be investigated extensively. Different historic settlements will be presented and discussed, in terms of different design elements and urban planning forms, and through the use of computational fluid dynamics(CFD). This paper presents the strategic ideas behind the research thinking and methodology of the project. As illustrative case studies, the ambient wind environment within the Shang-Gan-Tang village in China and the Pierce bridge, Melling, Hawks head, Castle Combe villages in the UK, have been investigated quantitatively, to evaluate the interactions between settlement selection, layout, landscape design and ambient environment. The sustainable urban planning experiences were then summarized for the modern sustainable human settlement suitable for people living for another hundreds of years.

AB  - Presently days, audit destinations are increasingly more defied with the spread of falsehood, i.e., assessment spam, which goes for advancing or harming some objective organizations, by deceiving either human peruses, or computerized feeling mining and opinion investigation frameworks. Thus, in the most recent years, a few information-driven methodologies have been proposed to survey the believability of client created content diffused through online life as on-line audits. Particular methodologies frequently think about various subsets of qualities, i.e., highlights, associated with the two audits and commentators, just as to the system structure connecting unmistakable elements on the survey site in test. This work goes for giving an examination of the fundamental audit and commentator driven highlights that have been proposed up to now in the writing to identify counterfeit surveys, specifically from those methodologies that utilize directed AI systems. These arrangements furnish when all is said in done better outcomes concerning simply unsupervised methodologies, which are frequently founded on chart-based strategies that think about social ties in audit destinations. besides, this work proposes and assesses.

AB  - IoT has the potential to transform the way we think about information and communication technology. IoT has been studied extensively across many disciplines such as the networking, communication, security, business, and management communities. However, many unsolved challenges, especially in managing heterogeneous IoTs, remain to be discussed. Recent studies propose using blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in IoT. This article presents a preliminary study on an architecture that implements blockchain in managing heterogeneous IoT systems. We start by pointing out the limitations of prior IoT systems and the difficulties of integrating IoT and blockchain. Then we outline an architecture to manage a large-scale heterogeneous IoT system. Our main goal is to stimulate further effort and cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing guidance and reference for future studies.

AB  - The concept of data compression in CODECs is based on pixel prediction to avoid redundancy. For the security of data compressed with the H.264/AVC CODEC, researchers are thinking to selective encryption. This paper presents a chaos based encryption method inserted in the H.264/AVC used for video conferencing application. It consists of the encryption of Intra prediction mode. The results show that the proposed method preserves format compliance of the H.264/AVC and has a low impact on the compression ratio. It is secure and very efficient. Moreover it can be realized in real time application. The metrics used to evaluate our scheme are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) and the Encryption Rate (ER). We also discuss the key sensitivity of our algorithm and histograms of encrypted videos.

AB  - Pedestrian detection can be applied to social security, and can effectively increase safety in traffic safety. In real life, there is a lot of complex background in the environment, such as illumination, occlusion, dress, attitude and perspective. Therefore, the pedestrian detection has been a challenging problems and a hot research topic in computer vision. In order to improve the detection speed and guarantee the detection accuracy, this paper proposed a pedestrian detection algorithm based on multi-feature cascade. The algorithm has two important points. The one, using the improved HOG feature to quickly eliminate negative samples to improve the detection speed. The other, using the cascade structure to guarantee the detection accuracy. In this paper, the experiment proves that the algorithm indeed improves the detection speed obviously, and prove that the algorithm is indeed effective in the improvement of these two important points. The algorithm is a research result which is obtained through study some classical pedestrian detection algorithms. And the algorithm shows the vitality of the classical algorithm and provides a new thinking way for researchers.

AB  - Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, $\text{CPFS}=(A,P)$, where $A$ is the classical PFS, while $P$ is a measurement of reliability for $A$. For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.

AB  - Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a  $2 \times 2$  factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.

AB  - Motivated by the practical demands for simplification of data toward being consistent with human thinking and problem-solving, as well as tolerance of uncertainty, information granules are becoming important entities in data processing at different levels of data abstraction. This article proposes a method to construct classifiers from multiresolution hierarchical granular representations using hyperbox fuzzy sets. The proposed approach forms a series of granular inferences hierarchically through many levels of abstraction. An attractive characteristic of our classifier is that it can maintain a high accuracy in comparison to other fuzzy min-max models at a low degree of granularity based on reusing the knowledge learned from lower levels of abstraction. In addition, our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handle the uncertainty and incompleteness associated with data in real-world applications. The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce it from data at higher abstraction levels. Experimental analyses conducted comprehensively on both synthetic and real datasets indicated the efficiency of our method in terms of training time and predictive performance in comparison to other types of fuzzy min-max neural networks and common machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Commuting is an important property in any two-step information merging procedure where the results should not depend on the order in which the single steps are performed. In the case of bisymmetric aggregation operators with the neutral elements, Saminger, Mesiar, and Dubois, have already reduced characterization of commuting n-ary operators to resolving the unary distributive functional equations, but only some sufficient conditions of unary functions distributive over two particular classes of uninorms are given out. Indeed, it is very difficult to get the full characterizations of these equations because they are bound up with the famous Cauchy functional equation, which has so far not been completely solved. Along this way of thinking, in this paper, we will respectively investigate and fully characterize the following two functional equations f(U(x,y))=S(f(x), f(y)) and f(S(x,y))=U(f(x),f(y)), where f:[0,1]→ [0,1] is an unknown function, U is a representable uninorm, and S is a continuous t-conorm. These results are an important step toward obtaining complete characterization of the other unary distributive functional equations previously mentioned. Our results show that commuting is suitable for only the second equation but not for the first one. This is because solutions of the first equation are all piecewise constant functions, while those of the second equation are formulas with parameters. In addition, the two equations both have nonmonotone solutions completely different from those ones obtained.

AB  - The design and development of smart products and services with data science enabled solutions forms a core topic of the current trend of digitalisation in industry. Enabling skilled staff, employees, and students to use data science in their daily work routine of designing such products and services is a key concern of higher education institutions, including universities, company workshop providers and in further education. The scope and usage scenario of this paper is to assess software modules ('tools') for integrated data and analytics as service (DAaaS). The tools are usually driven by machine learning, may be deployed in cloud infrastructures, and are specifically targeted at particular needs of the industrial manufacturing, production, or supply chain sector. The paper describes existing theories and previous work, namely methods used in didactics, work done for visually designing and using machine learning algorithms (no-code /low-code tools), as well as combinations of these two topics. For tools available on the market, an extended assessment of their suitability for a set of learning scenarios and personas is discussed.

AB  - As the students’ profile and the industry’s expectations change over time, universities must adopt learning methodologies to deliver more suitable graduates to the labor market. The Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB) has been developing experiential learning practices by implementing challenge-based learning (CBL) to enrich undergraduates’ curricula. One example reflected in the CBL experiences developed by Taquiña Brewery, one of the five breweries of the Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (CBN), and the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department of the UPB between 2018 and 2019. As a result, the students widely accepted the methodology, and academics from all disciplines were trained to replicate CBL experiences in their classrooms. While CBN found the opportunity to hire new talent, receive a fresh perspective on recurrent operational issues, and find new ideas based on theoretical concepts. This work contributes to the exemplification of innovative approaches to enhance the teaching and learning of Supply Chain Management and Logistics.

AB  - Neural Style Transfer (NST) currently leads the artistic creation field that combines artistry with technological innovation, well master the advanced of Convolution neural network (CNN) makes image manipulation easy and with creative flair. This paper suggests the optimized approach for NST which includes a dataset selection, choosing the type model architecture, learning strategies and, all-inclusive evaluation metrics. Through meticulous experimentation, we explore four distinct dimensions of NST applications: face painting, super-slow-motion, interactive, user-customization, real-time performance along online social media. In investigating superior style transfer our product highlights the highest perceptual matching, faithful style representation, and content preservation metrics ensuring the fulfillment of artistic style without deformation of the original content. Model efficiency is achieved by introducing optimized model architectures and fast training strategies, which, in turn, provide for responsive style transfer in real time with as little latency and resource consumption as possible. This is done by adapting models within a specific artistic domain through up-tuning models which will be the source of style transfer that can be tweaked in a manner that caters for any artistic domain. Therefore, the paper research is fundamental because of the management of the user’s experience by user-guided interaction, which has given interactive controls and real-time feedback that assist the users to customize stylization according to their likes and dislikes. Gratifying user scoring demonstrates the power of user-directed style transfer as a means of furthering users’ engagement and artistry.t.

AB  - The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, WeChat, and others have grown exponentially over time with the growth of the Internet and has become the most influential networking platforms in the 21st century. They are well-known for their low-cost, quick, and effective communication. However, the enhancement of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contributes to online abuse, harassment, cyberbullying, cyber flashing, cybercrime, and online trolling. In this paper, we are focusing on cyber-flashing, the unsolicited sending of nude or sexual images, which is a common practice but often met with negative reactions from receivers. During and after COVID lockdown, cyber-flashing has been a serious threat on WhatsApp recently. The majority of study, meanwhile, has focused on identifying instances of cyberbullying rather than the effects of cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is the act of sending an inappropriate photo or video to another person, as well as exposing oneself to another via live video. An essential step in the detection of cyber-flashing is evaluating the level of risk in terms of abusiveness in the provided picture, or video. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create and refine a method that can effectively identify abusive cyber-flashing content and prevent inappropriate content sharing within the social media platforms or public Wi-Fi network. As a result, we have proposed a unique technique, where we employ a multi- stage model for identifying cyber-flashing photos and the proposed YOLOv3-YCbCr performs best in terms of metrics, with 98.14% accuracy, 95.58% specificity, and 97.27% sensitivity. First, the YOLOv3 technique is used to detect human presence in the image. Then, the YCbCr model is used for the skin detection and analysis. In the context of intelligent systems, skin detection is a difficult topic that has drawn a lot of attention from specialists and experts from the research community; the lack of uniform testing methodologies and standard benchmarks have made it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. Based on our studies, YOLOv3-YCbCr performs far better for skin segmentation than any prior hand-crafted approach method.

AB  - We give new characterizations and lower bounds relating classes in the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy and circuit complexity to limited memory communication models. We introduce the notion of rectangle overlay complexity of a function f. This is a natural combinatorial complexity measure in terms of combinatorial rectangles in the communication matrix of f. Furthermore, we consider memory less and limited-memory communication models, originally introduced in Brody, Chen, Papakonstantinou, Song, and Sun with slightly different terminology. In these communication models there are two parameters of interest: The maximum message length s (which we think of as space) and the number of memory states w. Specifically, these are one-way protocols which proceed in rounds. In each round, Alice sends a message of at most s bits to Bob, receiving a message from Alice, Bob has to decide on the spot whether to output 0 or 1, or to continue the protocol. If he decides to continue, he immediately forgets Alice's message. In memory less protocols, no memory is transferred between different rounds (but Bob still has "space" to hold Alice's messages within each round). We can make Bob more powerful by giving him w memory states. He can change into a new state at the end of each round. We show that rectangle overlays completely characterize memory less protocols. Then, we go on to show several connections to the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy defined by Babai, Frankl and Simon in 1986. This hierarchy has recently regained attention because its connection to the algebrization barrier in complexity theory (Aaronson and Wigderson, 2009). We show that P^NP^cc is completely characterized by memory less protocols with polylog(n) space (maximum message length), and thus it admits a purely combinatorial characterization in terms of rectangle overlays. If Bob has 3 memory states and Alice sends messages of length polylog(n), they can compute every level of Sigma_k in the communication complexity hierarchy (for constant k), and also every function in AC0. Furthermore, we show that with 5 memory states and messages of length polylog(n) they can compute exactly the functions in the communication class PSPACE^cc. This gives the first meaningful characterization of PSPACE^cc in terms of space, originally defined in Babai, Frankl, and Simon without any notion of space. We also study equivalences and separations between our limited memory communication model and branching programs, and relations to circuit classes.

AB  - Traditionally, many people still wish to write on pen and paper. However, it has some drawbacks, like accessing and storing physical documents efficiently, searching through them, and sharing them efficiently. Handwriting to Text Conversion (HTC) classifies and converts an individual’s handwriting into digital form. However, HTC removes all the mentioned problems as storing, retrieving, and using the text as and when required is easier. Emotions are a basic and particularly important aspect of one’s life. To understand this important aspect of an individual’s life, we must detect emotions using affect data like text, voice, and image. We have used text as the effect data for this work. We can find a person’s emotions behind his text by sentiment analysis. Sentiment recognition and analysis is a topic with wide research as many brands, companies, and even famous personalities are very much interested in getting feedback and thus do the evaluation of their performance and knowing what people think about them around the world. Authors have proposed a model where they collected data from social media reviews and classified it into three broad categories, which are positive, negative, and neutral. Find the emotions category viz. happiness, sadness, shame, anger, disgust, fear, surprise, or neutral from three types of classified sentiments. The proposed model combined machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to achieve the best outcome.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of Dementia. It affects the brain functions, thinking ability and creates memory loss. Each stage of AD is worsening the symptoms and also affects the patient's daily activities. The current diagnosis AD detection process is not providing an accurate report for the early stages of AD. Therefore, accurate Alzheimer detection is an open challenge for the researchers. In this research, a deep learning model is introduced to improve Alzheimer's stage diagnosis. The Hybrid deep model is designed to detect abnormal changes in brain (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI scans. It utilizes the multi-class log loss (MCLL) function as the objective function to reduce the error rate in detecting AD stages. The MCLL approach computes the variations in actual and detected AD stages of each biomarkers features of input MRI images to identify loss rate. It helps to reduce the loss rate in AD stages detection. Moreover, the Hybrid deep learning model for Alzheimer stages detection (HDLMASD)system analysis the images deeply to provide accurate biomarkers detection with the help of all essential biomarkers processing steps. The efficiency of the Alzheimer stages diagnosis system is evaluated with various evaluation metrics. Finally, a comparative analysis is made with multiple present diagnosis systems to verify the performance of the AD detection system. The performance analysis proves that the AD stages diagnosis approach accuracy rate is improved up to 0.47% and the prediction error rate reduced up to 0.49% than comparison approaches.

AB  - Human behaviour representation (HBR) is playing a significant role in Computer-Generated Forces (CGFs). However, current HBR lacks realistic and human-like characteristics, and many domain experts think that integrating personality and individual differences into existing simulation tools in CGFs is able to improve HBR. This article describes an approach to represent reasoning with personality effects in variable cognitive processes in CGFs. By combining the Integrated Performance Modelling Environment (IPME), the proposed representation provides a high level reasoning tool for human behaviour modelling. This approach deals with deterministic and uncertainty reasoning with influence of personality and supports user-defined personality models in simulated military operators. This research shows the possibility to integrate the reasoning with personality effects into performance simulation engines in CGFs for improving current HBR.

It has enabled a new technology where we can have a human-like conversation with the machines. Now, computers are much more than just being advanced calculators. Judging to check if a computer can only think will be a major understatement to the modern computer’s ability. Analogous to a human, it is not enough to only be intelligent, a human needs to communicate well to be perceived as “intelligent”. In this paper, we will create a test to judge if a machine can communicate.

AB  - Automatic extraction of human opinions from Web documents has been receiving increasing interest. An important part of the information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.

AB  - Existing cloud frameworks involve isolating low-level operations within an application for data distribution and partitioning. This limits their applicability for many applications with complex data dependency considerations. This paper aims to explore new methods of partitioning and distributing data in the cloud by fundamentally re-thinking the way in which future data management models will need to be developed on the Internet. Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach. The proposed model envisions a distributed data management scheme for large-scale data processing and database updating that is capable of providing scalable real-time recognition and processing with high accuracy while being able to maintain low computational cost in its function.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain are increasingly growing focus on research. Blockchain is like the Internet when we first knew of it. This new technology could revolutionize how we do everything. Seriously, everything. Think how the Internet changed our daily lives today. And just like that, we don't really have to understand the technology behind it and be knowledge of its importance. But what makes this innovation revolution a bigger deal than Bitcoin and possibly even the Internet itself, are the exponential opportunities the concept provides. However, the potential to integrated Blockchain to Internet of Things (IoT) has constraint due to the required high computational power. IoT comprises of numerous platforms which have limited performance. Usually, these platforms cannot handle intensive procedures and often has scalability issues. In this paper, we give an overview of consensus algorithms and the necessity of this method to blockchain technology. Moreover, we focused on three of the utmost common consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology and explore their potential adaptation in an IoT framework with respect to its requirements.

From the facts of many practices, we can see that computer technology is a good technology for many industries and can bring many benefits to the industry. Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Computer technology plays a positive role in improving legislative and judicial efficiency, coping with and avoiding technical risks.

AB  - eScience is now an example field for conducting science using advanced computational methodologies, middle-ware and workflows. With the ever-increasing data intensity in various scientific disciplines and the opportunities provided by novel artificial intelligence (AI) and computing techniques, there is a pressing need for eScience to adapt and develop holistic approaches for AI-integrated science and interdisciplinary collaboration between science, AI and computing experts. This paper discusses the transformative shift needed in the conduct and tools of eScience from traditional workflows, often linear, pre-defined to coordinate task execution and individually developed, to integrated “teamflows”, a term coined to encapsulate methods for effective team collaboration and communication, dynamic data and service integration, and use-inspired thinking. In the AI in science era of scientific investigation, this “future of eScience” special track paper: 1) emphasizes the vital importance of eScience to the success of collaborative AI in science teams; 2) recites some requirements for open data and services for AI-enhanced workflows, team science and incentive structures to create a more inclusive and efficient discovery environment; and 3) discusses impact as a measure of success in eScience.

AB  - Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<; 0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<; 0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates.

AB  - Label placement is very important when we display the electronic map. It will affect the beauty of electronic map. Furthermore, in order to display label placement in real-time, the computational complexity can not be too high. A novel algorithm of label placement is expounded based on the thinking of grid. It first divides the screen simply, then those three objects of points, arcs and polygons will be dealt with. The label configuration is reasonable, and does not result in any overlap. The experimental result indicates this algorithm is simple and effective. It can meet the demand of high quality map dynamic label placement and is successfully applied in commercial GIS.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) architecture, a functionally-sliced microarchitecture with memory units interleaved with vector and matrix deep learning functional units in order to take advantage of dataflow locality of deep learning operations. The TSP is built based on two key observations: (1) machine learning workloads exhibit abundant data parallelism, which can be readily mapped to tensors in hardware, and (2) a simple and deterministic processor with producer-consumer stream programming model enables precise reasoning and control of hardware components, achieving good performance and power efficiency. The TSP is designed to exploit parallelism inherent in machine-learning workloads including instruction-level, memory concurrency, data and model parallelism, while guaranteeing determinism by eliminating all reactive elements in the hardware (e.g. arbiters, and caches). Early ResNet50 image classification results demonstrate 20.4K processed images per second (IPS) with a batch-size of one— a $4 \times$ improvement compared to other modern GPUs and accelerators [44]. Our first ASIC implementation of the TSP architecture yields a computational density of more than 1 TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its $25 \times 29$ mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz. The TSP demonstrates a novel hardware-software approach to achieve fast, yet predictable, performance on machine-learning workloads within a desired power envelope.

AB  - This paper first presents an input-stationary (IS) implemented crossbar accelerator (INCA), supporting inference and training for deep neural networks (DNNs). Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM’s computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories—it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM’s nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy.

AB  - The soroban is a traditional arithmetic tool whose life in modern Japan reflected an inherently material dimension of computational numeracy. Using a system of commands to carry out operations, the soroban was both doubted and enthusiastically embraced by educators as a way of teaching basic mathematics, sparking conversations of what it really meant to understand arithmetic. Despite the introduction of Western-style pen and paper arithmetic, it persisted as the standard tool of computing in households, businesses, and bureaucracy, driving the Taylorist training of human calculators who could apply its commands with corporal discipline and the design of mechanical calculators that simplified its procedures. Even when educators held an “intuitive” ideal of mental calculation that moved students away from calculating with physical tools, the soroban persevered as a virtual interface that calculators accessed in their minds.

AB  - Collaborative filtering (CF) from implicit datasets has attracted much attention in recent years. The current mainstream pairwise methods optimize the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and are empirically proven to be helpful to exploit implicit feedback, but lead to not addressing the rank-biased scenarios where positive items are supposed to be placed on the top-k positions. Although there exist listwise methods, they have low efficiency and are not particularly adequate for general implicit feedback situations. To that end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely Collaborative List-and-Pairwise Filtering (CLAPF), which aims to introduce pairwise thinking into listwise methods. Specifically, we first smooth a well-known rank-biased measure called Mean Average Precision (MAP) as a low-bound version to make it can be optimized. After that, we combined the objective functions of optimizing the MAP with pairwise comparisons. The CLAPF framework is a new hybrid model that provides the idea of utilizing a listwise measure in a pairwise way on implicit feedback.

AB  - There has been a global change of perception about right to education over the past few decades. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services. In this paper we present the usability evaluation of public cloud applications across three universities in Pakistan from stakeholders' perspective i.e. (teachers and students). Our experimental results show that there is lack of awareness on using cloud-based services for accessing educational resources.

AB  - High schools and undergraduate courses present several problems regarding teaching programming. In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically.

AB  - Graph neural cellular automata are a recently introduced class of computational models that extend neural cellular automata to arbitrary graphs. They are promising in various applications based on preliminary test results and the successes of related computational models, such as neural cellular automata and convolutional and graph neural networks. However, all previous graph neural cellular automaton implementations have only been able to modify data associated with the vertices and edges, not the underlying graph topology itself. Here we introduce a method of encoding graph topology information as vertex data by assigning each edge and vertex an opacity value, which is the confidence with which the model thinks that that edge or vertex should be present in the output graph. Graph neural cellular automata equipped with this encoding method, henceforth referred to as translucent graph neural cellular automata, were tested in their ability to learn to reconstruct graphs from random subgraphs of them as a proof of concept. The results suggest that translucent graph neural cellular automata are capable of this task, albeit with optimal learning rates highly dependent on the graph to be reconstructed.

A deep fusion among cyber space, physical space, social space, and thinking space brings a quaternionic cyber-physical-social-thinking hyperspace, based on which an embryo of smart world is being established through heterogeneous spaces. The smart world is expected to be an attractive perspective involving ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communication to achieve comprehensive interconnections of physical perception, cyber interaction, social correlation, and cognitive thinking. In this paper, evolution of the smart world is briefly introduced, and physical-based coordination, social-inspired interactivity, brain-abstracted cooperativity, and cyber-enabled homogeneity are, respectively, discussed as the main characteristics of the smart world.

AB  - The modern world is evolving rapidly, especially with respect to the development and proliferation of increasingly intelligent, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-related technologies. Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today's technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a “Human-or-AI” conversation about task assignments to more contextualized “Human-and-AI” way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.

AB  - This research full paper describes our experience in teaching parallel programming for students without previous knowledge of basic concepts of computing, comparing their levels of learning. The use of parallel software grew considerably in recent years due to the increasing availability of multi and many-core devices. The evolution of hardware and software resources collaborated for a remarkable computational processing power offered by parallel programs. However, parallel programming is taught usually in more advanced years of the undergraduate computer courses, due to its supposed prerequisites as sequential programming, operating systems, computer architectures and others. Postponing parallel programming teaching hinder students to apply parallelism other subjects, reducing the probability of these future professionals think on parallel solutions naturally. We executed 05 experiments teaching parallel programming subjects for 252 students. We analyzed whether students without prerequisites could learn parallel programming in the same level verified with students with prior computing knowledge. We used three different teaching methodologies: traditional, Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The teaching and learning evaluation took into account such metrics: parallelism thinking of students, use of programming-model, correct output of the program, source-code readability and satisfaction of the students. The paper shows that it is possible to teach parallel programming to students without previous knowledge of computing, obtaining high scores and interest in such learning. Our results contribute positively to disseminate parallel programming, which is vital to extract performance from nowadays computers.

AB  - As computing becomes more powerful and extends the reach of those who wield it, the imperative grows for computing professionals to make ethical decisions regarding the use of that power. We propose the concept of abstracted power to help computer science students understand how technology may distance them perceptually from consequences of their actions. Specifically, we identify technological intermediation and computational thinking as two factors in computer science that contribute to this distancing. To counter the abstraction of power, we argue for increased emotional engagement in computer science ethics education, to encourage students to feel as well as think regarding the potential impacts of their power on others. We suggest four concrete pedagogical approaches to enable this emotional engagement in computer science ethics curriculum, and we share highlights of student reactions to the material.

AB  - Two assumptions have become dominant in the field of social computing and crowd sourcing - the computational view, and the assumption of a human-only crowd. In this paper, I address those assumptions. I trace their origin in the human-computation metaphor, and argue that while this metaphor is instrumental in facilitating novel developments, it also constrains the thinking of designers. I discuss some of the limitations this metaphor might impose, and offer that additional perspectives, such as an organizational design perspective and the distributed cognition perspective can help us think of novel possibilities of organizing work with crowd sourcing. I call for extending the conversation among computer-scientists and organizational researchers, and propose that the metaphor of 'information processing' might serve as a 'boundary-object' around which the dialogue among these communities can thrive.

AB  - The augmented reality (AR) applications have been widely used in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) because of good immersion experience for users, but their ultralow delay demand and high energy consumption bring a huge challenge to the current communication system and terminal power. The emergence of mobile-edge computing (MEC) provides a good thinking to solve this challenge. In this article, we study an energy-efficient task offloading and resource allocation scheme for AR in both the single-MEC and multi-MEC systems. First, a more specific and detailed AR application model is established as a directed acyclic graph according to its internal functionality. Second, based on this AR model, a joint optimization problem of task offloading and resource allocation is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of each user subject to the latency requirement and the limited resources. The problem is a mixed multiuser competition and cooperation problem, which involves the task offloading decision, uplink/downlink transmission resources allocation, and computing resources allocation of users and MEC server. Since it is an NP-hard problem and the communication environment is dynamic, it is difficult for genetic algorithms or heuristic algorithms to solve. Therefore, we propose an intelligent and efficient resource allocation and task offloading algorithm based on the deep reinforcement learning framework of multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) in a dynamic communication environment. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the energy consumption of each user terminal.

AB  - In the Turing test a computer model is deemed to “think intelligently” if it can generate answers that are indistinguishable from those of a human. We developed an analogous Turing-like handshake test to determine if a machine can produce similarly indistinguishable movements. The test is administered through a telerobotic system in which an interrogator holds a robotic stylus and interacts with another party - artificial or human with varying levels of noise. The interrogator is asked which party seems to be more human. Here, we compare the human-likeness levels of three different models for handshake: (1) Tit-for-Tat model, (2) λ model, and (3) Machine Learning model. The Tit-for-Tat and the Machine Learning models generated handshakes that were perceived as the most human-like among the three models that were tested. Combining the best aspects of each of the three models into a single robotic handshake algorithm might allow us to advance our understanding of the way the nervous system controls sensorimotor interactions and further improve the human-likeness of robotic handshakes.

AB  - Computation occurred within human brain is very much awesome and is not possible to be emulated 100% exactly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) method-based machines. What scientists did and have been done so far up to now are to try to model it as close as to what exactly occurs within the brain. Human brain has an awesome mechanism in performing computation with the end result is new knowledge and human uses the knowledge to actuate his organs. In this paper we will show a new approach for emulating the computation occured within human brain to obtain new knowledge based on the inputs sensed by the system's sensory system taken from the environment. When this process is carried out recursively, the system's knowledge becomes newer and newer, and it is called as knowledge growing. This approach is designed for an agent that has ability to think and act rationally like human. Our cognitive modelling approach is resulted in a model of human information processing and a technique to obtain the most maximum performance should be taken by the cognitive agent. This method is called as A3S (Arwin-Adang-Aciek-Sembiring), the agent is called as Knowledge-Growing System (KGS) and this brain-inspired method opens a new perspective in AI that we call as Cognitive Artificial Intelligence (CAI).

AB  - In this work, we use a subjective approach to compute cyber resilience metrics for industrial control systems. We utilize the extended form of the R4 resilience framework and span the metrics over physical, technical, and organizational domains of resilience. We develop a qualitative cyber resilience assessment tool using the framework and a subjective questionnaire method. We make sure the questionnaires are realistic, balanced, and pertinent to ICS by involving subject matter experts into the process and following security guidelines and standards practices. We provide detail mathematical explanation of the resilience computation procedure. We discuss several usages of the qualitative tool by generating simulation results. We provide a system architecture of the simulation engine and the validation of the tool. We think the qualitative simulation tool would give useful insights for industrial control systems' overall resilience assessment and security analysis.

AB  - With the emergence of smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as deep learning technologies have witnessed an increasing adoption. To support the requirements of such paradigm in terms of memory and computation, joint and real-time deep co-inference framework with IoT synergy was introduced. However, the distribution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has drawn attention to the privacy protection of sensitive data. In this context, various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where a malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into his device. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aiming to secure the sensitive data through re-thinking the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image. We formulate such a methodology, namely DistPrivacy, as an optimization problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference, the privacy level of the data, and the limited-resources of IoT participants. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce an online heuristic that supports heterogeneous IoT devices as well as multiple DNNs and datasets, making the pervasive system a general-purpose platform for privacy-aware and low decision-latency applications.

AB  - With the rapid growth of large online social networks, the ability to analyze large-scale social structure and behavior has become critically important, and this has led to the development of several scalable graph processing systems. In reality, however, social interaction takes place not only between pairs of individuals as in the graph model, but rather in the context of multi-user groups. Research has shown that such group dynamics can be better modeled through a more general hypergraph model, resulting in the need to build scalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we present MESH, a flexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH provides an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that naturally extends the "think like a vertex" model common to many popular graph processing systems. Our framework provides a flexible implementation based on an underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices for the key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We implement MESH on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in Apache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets and experiments conducted on a local 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate that MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics, as well as scalability with cluster size. We further show that it is competitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph processing system based on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about 5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not come at the cost of performance.

AB  - Automotive platforms today run hundreds of millions of lines of software code implementing a large number of different control applications spanning across safety-critical functionality to driver assistance and comfort-related functions. While such control software today is largely designed following model-based approaches, the underlying models do not take into account the details of the implementation platforms, on which the software would eventually run. Following the state-of-the-art in control theory, the focus in such design is restricted to ensuring the stability of the designed controllers and meeting control performance objectives, such as settling time or peak overshoot. However, automotive platforms are highly cost-sensitive and the issue of designing “resource-efficient” controllers has largely been ignored so far and is addressed using very ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we will illustrate how, following traditional embedded systems design oriented thinking, computation, communication and memory issues can be incorporated in the controller design stage, thereby resulting in control software not only satisfying the usual control performance metrics but also making efficient utilization of the resources on distributed automotive architectures.

AB  - Quadratic Unconstraint Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a combinatorial optimization problem such that an $n\times n$ upper triangle matrix $W$ is given and the objective is to find an n-bit vector $X$ that minimizes the energy value $E(X)=X^{T}WX$. A QUBO instance $W$ is sparse if instance $W$ has few non-zero elements. The D-Wave 2000$Q$ is a quantum annealer that can solve 2048-bit sparse QUBO instances represented as a Chimera graph topology. We present a sparse QUBO solver running on GPUs for 2048-bit sparse QUBO with a Chimera graph topology. We have evaluated the performance of our sparse QUBO solver and the D-Wave 2000Q for solving 2048-bit QUBO instances with various resolutions. The experimental results show that our sparse QUBO solver running on a GPU cloud server with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs can find optimal solutions in less than 3ms for all instances while the D-Wave 2000$Q$ cannot find them in 996.7ms. Hence, our QUBO solver can find better solutions than the D-Wave 2000Q in less than 1/300 running time. We can think that our QUBO solver is a quantum annealer simulator with better performance in terms of the accuracy of solutions and the running time. Our result implies that quantum annealer D-Wave 2000$Q$ does not achieve quantum supremacy yet.

AB  - Background: Personalisation is a critical element in the learning environment of students. This is one area that our educational system falls short. Students study at varying rates and in varying contexts, and this should be considered, which most institutions do not. We need a structure that enables students of diverse background to research and learn in their own unique manner, at their own speed, in order to grasp concepts and solve problems. Today, there is something that is gaining a lot of popularity. The future is artificial intelligence, and we agree that science holds the secret to resolving the majority of the world's problems. Result: This article provides a novel model of a system that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to assist students in learning to program and creates a customized system for them. The model classifies students into beginner, intermediate, and proficient ranks using Bayesian networks. Students are helped to understand ideas by the use of tools such as flowcharts. Each level of students is provided with unique instruments and materials, and the goal is to raise the comprehension level of beginner and intermediate students to a point that they can compete with proficient students, who are provided with practice questions to further their learning. Additionally, skilled students have the ability to work in industry through the model's industry-academia partnership module. Conclusion: This paper proposes a technique that helps students in customized learning as well as in improving their critical thinking capacities using a multi-agent-based flowchart development tool. It serves as an absolute and a complete tutoring aid for students learning programming.

AB  - As the density of sensing/computation/actuation nodes is increasing, it becomes more and more feasible and useful to think at an entire network of physical devices as a single, continuous space-time computing machine. The emergent behaviour of the whole software system is then induced by local computations deployed within each node and by the dynamics of the information diffusion. A relevant example of this distribution model is given by aggregate computing and its companion language field calculus, a minimal set of purely functional constructs used to manipulate distributed data structures evolving over space and time, and resulting in robustness to changes. In this paper, we study the convergence time of an archetypal and widely used component of distributed computations expressed in field calculus, called gradient: a fully-distributed estimation of distances over a metric space by a spanning tree. We provide an analytic result linking the quality of the output of a gradient to the amount of computing resources dedicated. The resulting error bounds are then exploited for network design, suggesting an optimal density value taking broadcast interferences into account. Finally, an empirical evaluation is performed validating the theoretical results.

AB  - Scheduling workloads on large-scale infrastructures, such as in the Edge-Cloud continuum is a challenging task. Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand. Finally, we leverage the Alibaba PAI dataset to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.

AB  - Currently, as many disciplines begin to cultivate a set of core methodologies, system of systems engineering (SoSE), which has its root in context of military programming, becomes a significant research focus and provides a new perspective to solve the emerging "system of systems" challenges in industrial analysis. Meanwhile, modern communication and information technologies have provided greater possibilities for socio-economic sectors to execute smarter decisions, and these technologies may advance the industrial application of SoSE. Therefore, targeting the rareness of government-oriented intelligent decision support system (DSS), and guided by the underlying system of systems thinking, this paper proposes a technical framework for designing a policy maker-responsive smart information system which focuses: (1) system of systems structural architecting; (2) geographical simulation using time-series remotely sensed data, GIS instrument and simulation bodies such as cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS); (3) SoS evolution description through network analysis and intelligent computing; (4) measurement of SoS effectiveness with two-tier and four-grade method; and (5) SoSE program for industrial optimization. Its application in tourism analysis will provide a smarter base for industrial policy-making, planning and forecasting, and will help reduce risk and cost in industrial restructuring. For this relatively new field of SoSE application, tools and methods are not perfect, so it is important to draw together academia, government, industrial organizations and enterprises to collaborate for further valuable achievement.

AB  - Active learning is an educational strategy that promotes the development of the student's critical and creative thinking through carefully designed activities. The teacher often faces challenges to design adequate physics problems because it demands a high effort to have enough variety of exercises for several students' levels. In addition, it is important to display exercises in an attractive visual and interactive environment, but this requires deep computer knowledge. Most common simulators in the literature are visually attractive, but are often designed to solve a particular or limited problem. Authoring tools have the advantage to allow building several learning environments, involving professors without computer expertise. Therefore, teachers require less effort and time to develop simulation problems. In this work we present an on line authoring simulation tool, called AuthorPhysics, aimed to facilitate the design of physics active learning problems, reducing instructors' time and effort. An initial evaluation of the usability and benefits of the system for the instructors was carried on. The results are encouraging in the sense that teachers are able to create a great variety of physical scenarios and problems, appropriate for introductory undergraduate and high-school physics courses. An evaluation with students is currently running.

AB  - In the physic world, exploring and discovering the mechanism behind the various phenomenon is crucial for us to know the world better. However, it is hard to discover the principle in case of enormous data and the mechanism may be too hard for a human to figure out. Data science gives us a way of knowing the world and finding the mechanism hidden in the data. Automatic tool like polynomial fitting is a useful method to fit the data well. When the variable number and degree are relatively low, the computation amount of polynomial is small. However, the number of monomials grows exponentially with the increasing variable number and degree. Problems in the real world are always in a high-dimension, and the problem may be complex that needs to use a high degree to fit data well. Plus, with the huge data, the computation complexity is high. Therefore, we think it is necessary to find a way to reduce the computation amount of fitted polynomial. In this paper, we propose to use the PSO algorithm to find the monomial sets that have lower computation amounts. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - This paper presents a pilot study that examines the capacity of novice testers to generate Metamorphic Relations (MRs) for autonomous driving systems (ADSs), specifically fo-cusing on parking functions. By comparing MRs generated by human participants with those generated by artificial intelligence (AI), we seek to understand the variances in quality, particularly in terms of correctness, applicability, novelty, and utility. Our findings indicate that despite receiving only minimal training, human participants were capable of producing MRs with a wide range of effectiveness. Notably, humans exhibited a potential for creative thinking, contrasting with AI's ability to generate MRs that adhere closely to technical and applicability standards. The study underscores the need for improved educational strategies aimed at enhancing the quality and confidence of MRs produced by humans. Future research directions will explore the optimization of training approaches, particularly within a constrained timeframe to create a positive learning experience and maintain participant engagement, to fully harness the creative capabilities of human learners in the context of ADS testing.

AB  - Nowadays, more and more compute-intensive applications begin to appear on mobile devices. However, mobile devices may not be able to satisfy the computing requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is proposed to address these issues. Mobile devices offload the computing tasks to the edge servers which accept tasks and handle them. And we think the edge servers should accomplish tasks as many as possible while minimizing total energy cost. However, users with mobile devices are usually keeping moving. In this situation, the energy consumption of tasks are constantly changing, and we need an efficient algorithm to dynamically determine how to offload tasks to a set of edge servers, to maximize the number of completed tasks while minimizing the energy consumption. The dynamic decision of task offloading is a multi-stage decision problem, and therefore we can model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Because this problem involves a huge state space with high dimension, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based mobile device task offloading algorithm to solve this problem. We also run extensive experiments to evaluate our task offloading approach against other typical task offloading approaches. The results of experiments show that our algorithm is superior to the baseline algorithms.

AB  - Graph learning is becoming increasingly popular due to its superior performance in tackling many grand challenges. While quantization is widely used to accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) computation, quantized training faces remarkable roadblocks. Current quantized GNN training systems often experience longer training time than their full-precision counterparts for two reasons: (i) addressing the quantization accuracy challenge leads to excessive overhead, and (ii) the optimization potential exposed by quanti-zation is not adequately leveraged. This paper introduces Tango which re-thinks quantization challenges and opportunities for graph neural network training on GPUs with three contributions: Firstly, we introduce efficient rules to maintain accuracy during quantized GNN training. Secondly, we design and implement quantization-aware primitives and inter-primitive optimizations to speed up GNN training. Finally, we integrate Tango with the popular Deep Graph Library (DGL) system and demonstrate its superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches on various GNN models and datasets.

AB  - GPU computing, nowadays widely and readily available on the cloud, has opened up novel opportunities for the parallelization of computationally-intensive tasks, such as data anonymization. The development of effective techniques that help to guarantee data anonymity is a critical enabler for data sharing activities, as well as to enforce compliance-think about the European GDPR. In this scenario, we focus on personal data stored in microdata sets. Before releasing such microdata to the general public, statistical agencies and the like have to sanitize them by using a variety of Microdata Protection Techniques (MPTs)that aim at keeping data utility while preserving some kind of anonymity. In particular, microaggregation is a specific MPT arisen in the field of statistical disclosure control. We analyze the microaggregation anonymization issues and propose three GPU-based parallel approaches for a well-known microaggregation technique: the Maximum Distance to Average Vector (MDAV)algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal and emphasize the benefits of using GPUs to speed-up the execution of privacy preserving algorithms for microdata.

DW as a real technology of Artificial Intelligent (AI) which show up as how to think like a human, inevitably help the human particularly in making quick decision reports. Doing DW to your systems should apply to the mother knowledge of AI which we recognized as Software Engineering (SE) where we should apply best software application in more importantly we should satisfy the user. In order to make a good DW model design as user expectation then we should apply 3 steps such as collect all the needed reporting, order all the reports start from the most needed reports and mapping all the ordered reports into fact constellation schema. In this paper the 3 steps to model DW schema is applied in sale transaction in franchise restaurant as an example data. Building franchise restaurant must supported by information technology such as Data Warehouse (DW) in order to manage and control the business process, the branch, the sale, the staff and so on.

AB  - The absence of the brain chemical acetylcholine is the characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. In the early stages, this condition is thought to cause minimal memory loss, but as the disease progresses, it causes some loss of ability during discussion. It is a brain illness in which memory is progressively lost along with the capacity to think and carry out some daily duties. Some areas of the brain are also involved, including those that regulate the ability to think, remember, and use language. Alzheimer's treatment choices vary depending on whether or not the Alzheimer's is present. An Alzheimer's disease biopsy is required prior to final brain surgery in order to confirm the diagnosis. There are an estimated 6 million persons in the United States who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and the majority of them are over the age of 65. Memory and other essential internal processes are lost as brain cell connections and cells themselves degrade and die. The most common signs and symptoms are disorientation and loss of memory. There is no cure, however medications and surgical procedures can alleviate symptoms for a while. For example, there are various hazard features to an Alzheimer's complaint, as well as a requirement for time to gather correct and accepted procedures in order to form an early assessment and resolve the complaint as quickly as possible. Data mining is a common practice in the healthcare industry for reusing large amounts of data. To better understand Alzheimer's disease, researchers use data mining and machine learning approaches to evaluate large volumes of medical information. Machine learning is being used to develop a model for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease at this time. In order to estimate the rise, various algorithms are examined and a current model is employed.

AB  - Firms are recognizing the need to distinguish between R&D and Innovation. Innovation is becoming a distinct management function in the lines of marketing, HR, etc. Businesses need to be ambidextrous in their thinking taking into account capabilities of both right (creative) and left (analytical) side of the brain as challenges faced today requires integral solutions. The need is to work in cross functional teams, develop deep understanding of customer role, collaborate and more importantly address customer needs that may even not known to them; rather than just apply branding or fancy design styling. Fundamentals to integral approach are collaboration, embracing multidimensionality, systems thinking and applying cybernetics principles. The integral approach should involve users, designers, customers and suppliers. One need to understand the user based on fieldwork study, reach insights into user role and discover unarticulated needs. We normally measure innovation in terms of its technical strength and its utility value. In many cases this may not be enough. Innovation is a renewal process in that it prepares one for the future. It involves investing in the development of competence of the people, developing capabilities in them, nurturing customer relationships, and organizing knowledge bases. The point where technical innovation gets done is at the core of all these activities. The Balanced Score Card (BSC) has aroused considerable interest in the last two decades in business performance measurement. The reason could be that the managers are finding something more than the short term revenue reports that are prevalent. In the similar way the innovation can be looked not just at the point of idea creation but should be viewed as a staged process in the organization for the innovation to see the light of the market in a concerted way. This paper explains a cybernetics approach of modeling the innovation activities along the lines of Balanced Score Card (BSC).The principles of cybernetics may considered to be useful in `how we design” innovations as much as in “what innovations we design”.

AB  - For decades, the security and privacy of data are among the major challenges faced by service providers dealing with public data. To cope with these challenges, most of the organizations rely on the adoption of cryptographic methods for protecting data against any illegitimate access and attacks. Modern day cryptographic ciphers utilize one or more substitution-boxes (S-boxes) that facilitate the realisation of strong security of plain data during encryption and legal decoding of it during decryption process. Security of ciphers is directly proportional to the cryptographic strength of S-boxes. This study proposes an efficient and simple method based on some modular operations for the construction of dynamic S-boxes with high nonlinearity using a heuristic evolution strategy. A large number of strong S-boxes can be easily constructed using slight variations in the parameters of the anticipated method. A specimen S-box is constructed and its critical performance analysis against standard security criteria including nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, bit independence criterion, differential uniformity, linear probability, and fixed points are reported as justification for the proposed technique's high cryptographic strength. Furthermore, the generated S-box is also applied to encrypt digital images to assess its cryptographic application performance. The performance and comparison study validates that the proposed S-box has better performance strength, which makes it a viable candidate for cryptographic applications in different areas of image security.

AB  - Apart from many project design decisions that have to be made when incorporating blockchain as a trusted transactions register, it is also essential to gain a deeper understanding of the ecosystem when it already entered operational state. By looking at the way how nodes perform transactions, how they cluster, or what is the dynamics of the network, many valuable insights can be derived about the condition of the whole system. This leads to improving functionality, performance, scalability, and security. We propose a way of looking at the network of transactions as at a complex network and demonstrate that the methods and algorithms provided by network science can significantly increase our knowledge about the blockchain ecosystem. In this work, we introduce an open-source platform called Dru that is linked to this concept and simplifies performing analyses by providing a built-in storage of transactions and an API for research. We believe that the insights presented in this work will be helpful for studying blockchain-based systems. As a result, those systems supporting variety of processes will be able to move from reactive to proactive thinking and improve their functionality, availability and security.

AB  - Micro-simulation becomes more and more important in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research, because it can provide detailed descriptions of the system. For a multi-agent systems (MAS) modeling of an ITS, the computation burden is large, as it involves the computation of the state changing of all the agents. And, there are many multi-objective optimization problems in the ITS research. In this paper, we solve the traffic light signaling optimization problem and we take the average delay time and the average stop times as two objectives. We use a famous method of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). As NSGA-II can be viewed as an intelligent way of running a number of micro-simulations, usually the computation burden is huge. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular tool for parallel computing. The real transportation system runs in parallel and we think that a parallel tool is more suitable for the simulation and optimization of the system. We test GPU based NSGA-II method on a 4 intersection lattice road network, and on the 18 intersection road network of the Zhongguancun area of Beijing. Compared with the CPU version, the GPU version implementation achieves a speedup factor of 21.46 and 27.64 respectively.

AB  - Recent advances have been effective for progressing the state of robotics toward its next level of intelligence. At this stage, further advancement is needed with sharper focus on increased robustness, cognitive facilities, and more sophisticated behavior. Advances to date are impacting individual elements of what would become a robotic intelligence pipeline but the paths to effective integration of those elements that will realize practical intelligent robots and robotic systems are unclear. This talk offers thoughts and considerations for active researchers to ponder and appreciate in the context of their research programs. From a perspective on current stages of technology development, and looking toward the progress horizon from that vista, the talk discusses a number of topics within the SACI 2019 scope using examples from research projects and deployed systems. Aspects of intelligent robotics associated with different domains and applications are discussed such as planetary robotics, disaster response and wearable robotics. Also addressed are future considerations for the evolution of related technology toward increased robotic autonomy and advanced intelligence for robotic systems. Motivating this discourse are multiple considerations for next-level robotic intelligence such as enhancing perception capabilities beyond the visual modality, moving beyond object recognition and grasping to knowledge and reasoning about object properties, enabling smart human-collaborative robots that are responsive to intuitive, physical, and brain-interfaced interaction, advancing from robot learning for X (perception, control, etc.) to autonomous or developmental learning and knowledge or skill transfer, the need to realize smart behavior for not only singular robots but for multi-robot systems, and some of the related systems engineering considerations. The aim is to broaden the thinking of current researchers leading to the collective leverage that will boost robotic intelligence to the next level enabling robots that are multi-functional in the real-world.

AB  - The advanced artificial intelligence technologies have promoted the development of other industries. As a combination of AI technologies and art, intelligent design has become a research hotspot in recent years. Intelligent design uses computer to simulate human thinking activities with AI technologies, enabling the computers to undertake more complex design tasks in a better way. At the same time, reinforcement learning plays an increasingly important role in many fields, such as system control, game theory, computer network, decision making, etc. In this work, an intelligent design system based on the reinforcement learning algorithm was proposed, and corresponding reward rules were developed according to the design principles. The system can help the designer to generate the optimal scheme automatically, which can be extended and applied to find the best scheme in many problems, including interior design, daily schedule, resource arrangement, etc. Our demo shows that the system can offer excellent design scheme according to pre-set reward rules, and reduce workload of related designers.

AB  - We report on the content and early evaluation of a new introductory programming course “Media Propelled Computational Thinking,” (abbreviated MPCT and pronounced iMPaCT). MPCT is integrated into a freshman-level program designed for under-prepared students with interests in a STEM discipline. It is intended to reduce attrition rates by fostering student intuition in, appreciation of, and confidence about basic pre-calculus concepts. The MPCT curriculum is problem-driven, with analytical challenge exercises that are intended to motivate inquiry and to illustrate the reasoning used in the STEM professions Preliminary evaluation results are encouraging - students from a wide range of academic majors found MPCT engaging, and report that the course conveyed insight, and decreased anxiety about foundational mathematical concepts.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) usually include a mix of movable things, embedded computers, and systems to keep track as well as actuate together with the encompassing real life. These computing components are generally wireless, interconnected to talk about interaction and data with one another, with the server component, and with cloud computing expertise. When it comes to such a heterogeneous atmosphere, brand new uses develop in order to meet ever-increasing requirements as well as these're a crucial problem on the processing features of products. For instance, instant traveling methods, producing locations, wise community managing, and so on. In order to fulfill the demands of stated application program contexts, the device is able to make computing procedures to disperse the work above the system and also a cloud computing server. Several choices develop within relation to what network nodes must support the delivery of all of the procedures. This particular paper concentrates on this issue by introducing a sent-out computational design and dynamically discuss the activities among the computing nodes as well as thinking about the natural variability on the context inside the locations. The approach of ours encourages the integration of the computing online resources, with externally provided cloud expertise, to satisfy contemporary program demands. The outcome of the Proposed design satisfies the shared computation level with energy efficient schemes and aslo achieved the response level in good level.

AB  - Science of artificial neural networks and relevant computing mechanisms since McCullock-Pitts artificial neuron (1943) up via neurons and networks of Anderson (1972), Barto et al (1983), Grosberg (1967, 1976), Hopfield (1982, 1984), Kohonen (1972) to Kasabov's evolving connectionist systems with spiking-neurons (2003) have undergone developments beyond any conceivable predictions. The computational efficiency and functionality of all kinds of neural network implies stable operating steady-state equilibrium is fast established and guaranteed. In parallel, Neurophysiology has yielded many insights Gayton-Hall (2006) converging to paradigm of systems biology. It appeared, on the crossroad of these findings with Hilbert's Thirteen problem and Kolmogorov's Superposition Representations in conjunction with Lyapunov foundations of stability and LaSalle invariance principle certain delicate subtle issues emerged Siljak (2008) and Sprecher (2017). This re-thinking the foundations of neural networks via the quest for parallels between artificial and living neurons is believed to open a new horizon. This belief follows obtained results on cultured-neuron controllers and recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays. A closer look into how animal and/or human brain cells can be cultivated as a controlling brain for a mobile robot (physical body) such that can move around and interact with the world. In turn, a new kind of artificial intelligence may be created, which is emulated by stabilized complex highly non-linear complex neural network system.

AB  - We are living more of our lives situated within online networks and communities where digital artifacts can be collected and processed to showcase individual and group behavior representations. Growing data bandwidth coupled with amplified computational resources are aligning to allow for analysis of human behaviors at unprecedented scales. The proper data generation, collection, storage and analysis techniques are mostly untaught in the undergraduate experience. Pedagogical research shows that project based learning encourages and supports design thinking and collaborative work; skills that are important to practitioners in data science centric industries. To address these academic needs, we develop the Evergreen Learning Platform (EvergreenLP). EvergreenLP is an interdisciplinary project based learning framework that leverages pedagogy rooted in Critical Media Literacy. Students take advantage of design-learning principles on the front-end and computational discipline standards on the back end. Students are engaged in the design, development and use of this platform while simultaneously contributing data content on the chosen social media platform. Our data analysis and visualization environment allows the student coders and non-coders to explore data science principles in context of a current event or topic trending on twitter. In this paper, we experimentally assess and present the benefits of introducing culturally relevant data techniques to African-American female students in an interdisciplinary seminar on #BlackGirlMagic (#BGM).

AB  - Much success has been achieved using GPUs to accelerate existing applications that are highly data parallel, or that are dominated by small, intense computational kernels. What are the prospects for porting existing large scientific models that do not fit this mold? We take an expensive routine from the CAM atmosphere model, and port it to a GPU using CUDA. We use the experience gained as a guide in thinking about porting the full application to an accelerator based system. We consider the best path forward for getting large scientific models running on accelerator based systems, and identify cases where porting may be feasible, and where a complete redesign may be the best option.

AB  - The issue of transcribed digit acknowledgment has for some time been an open issue in the field of example order. A few examined have demonstrated that Neural Network has an incredible execution in information arrangement. The fundamental target of this paper is to give effective and solid procedures to acknowledgment of transcribed numerical by looking at different existing arrangement models. This paper thinks about the exhibition of Convolutional Neural Network (CCN). Results demonstrate that CNN classifier beat over Neural Network with critical improved computational effectiveness without relinquishing execution. Handwritten digit recognition can be performed using the Convolutional neural network from Machine Learning. Using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technologies) database and compiling with the CNN gives the basic structure of my project development. So, basically to perform the model we need some libraries such as NumPy, `Pandas', TensorFlow, Keras. These are the main structure on which my main project stands. MNIST data contains about 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9. So, it is a class 10 classification model. This dataset is divided into 2 parts i.e. Training and Test dataset. Image representation as 28*28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.

Due to this, it has gained a wide fan base and many people are working every day to improve the accuracy of object detection models using deep learning. But this improved performance comes at the price of increased computational overhead, which limits the ability of a machine learning model to be utilized on devices having small Graphical Processing Units. The core intent of this paper is to compare computation time for models such as Histogram of Oriented gradients (0.4 seconds) and ResNet (48.5 seconds) with BlazeFace (0.09 seconds), a model developed by google in the year 2020 and is a mobile device friendly model and fits well with real time application which need instant feedback and on top of that cannot handle bulky computations required for deep learning models.

AB  - For all computer scientists the term `modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.

AB  - Increasing the number of social media users and the way these users write the regional languages have pushed the researchers to think about the originality of these languages. The native speakers are in fear that with time the regional languages may lose their originality. For such reason, the correctness checking at the time of writing is an important task in the field of natural language processing. The conventional methods for checking the correctness of a sentence are normally carried out by applying various syntactic and semantic rules and the rules are endless because of the free word order nature of the Assamese language. On the other hand, in the computational filed, the data-driven models are more appropriate than the rule-based system and the data-driven model is free from the rules. In this research work, a data-driven model is designed by using the different types of n-gram models like unigram, bigram, and trigram to check the correctness of the Assamese sentences along with the linear interpolation method. Assamese is one of the twenty-two official languages of India, predominantly spoken in Assam and its neighboring states. A corpus of the size of around 1 million words is used to train the system. During testing, four different levels of experiments are carried out one for the correct sentences and incorrect sentences. The F1-score of the system in correcting the users' sentences is above 60%.

AB  - A computational thinking under simulated environment with amendable properties is promoted. It is exemplified on a real drum boiler multi-loop linear control. The model is based on the boiler-turbine plant P16/G16, which is oil-fired and the rated power is 160 MW, at the Sydvenska Kraft AB Plant in Malmö, Sweden. A proficient symbolic and numerical combination points out a fast and very efficient automatic engineering calculation. This contribution aims at tailor-made small simulators on Matlab for those industrial processes which are linked by heat energy. A first application at drum boiler with linear control meets a useful know-how to guide thoughts on how to translate physical fundamentals to Matlab codes for other industrial cases. Some comments relating to industrial practice are offered in this context.

AB  - Giving the robot a “human” inner life, such as the capability to think about itself and to understand what the other team members are doing, would increase the efficiency of trustworthy interactions with the other members of the team. Our long-term research goal is to provide the robot with a computational model of inner life helping the robot to reason about itself, its capabilities, its environment and its teammates. Robot inner speech is a part of the research goal. In this paper, we summarize the results obtained in this direction.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels and increasing concerns of global warming has forced the society to think about environmental friendly energy resources. Wind energy is a viable option in this regard. Vertical axis wind turbines offer promising solution and hence relieving the society from the integrated grid systems. Small scale urban roof top vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is one of the simplest forms with its wide spread applications necessitating its design and development in a cost-effective manner. A study is undertaken on a three straight bladed VAWT. The design is formulated using available empirical formulas and sophisticated software's leading to a fabricated scaled down prototype. A detailed CFD and stress analysis is done on multiple struts configurations, central column assemblies, blade profiles to optimize the performance of the turbine. A comparison is also made between the analytical, software based and experimental results.

AB  - We describe our early investigation of the integration of educational modules originally developed for a college-level entering students program (ESP) titled “Media Propelled Computational Thinking” (MPCT) into high school science, math, and engineering/technology courses. Primary objectives of MPCT include introducing students to imperative programming and reinforcement of foundational mathematical concepts. This report describes this evolving integration including early informal experiments and potential extensions using programming functions of ubiquitous graphing calculators.
