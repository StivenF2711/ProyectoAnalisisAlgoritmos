AB  - The literature about teaching programming usually reputes its learning as a difficult task. Some of them studied different aspects aiming to identify the reasons behind the high failure rates, such as students' mathematics background and text comprehension. This study is focused on identifying which mathematical knowledge positively correlates with programming skills acquisition. We claim that mathematical concepts related to induction, inference and logical reasoning are among such knowledge. To confirm it we conducted a quasi-experiment with students who were enrolled at a first programming course (CS1). We analysed their mathematical knowledge through a test and gathered information on their difficulties and strategies used to overcome their programming difficulties. The data sample was too small to allow for strong assertions. However, the results indicates a possible correlation between mathematical abilities and programming potential. Also, students repute the logic of programming and teaching methodology as the main sources of difficulties. Furthermore, many of them prefer to ask their teachers or look at websites to tackle their difficulties.

AB  - In this article, we examine a female-oriented, high school computing outreach program, FLAMES, consisting of an 8-week high school summer intern program run within a university computer science (CS) department. We focus on examining the effects of the program on students skills and affect towards computing. Much of the literature in CS outreach research examines summer camps, after-school programs, and other school-year events that often have a focus on only teaching students computing content. Our program is unique and socially relevant as students are trained to assist teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-Infused curricula for their classrooms. This paper presents the design of our program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, facilitators, and the teachers assisted by the participants. We share our lessons learned in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.

AB  - Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as, inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.

AB  - Introduction to programming is a traditional and compulsory course for first year Computer Science students. However, research in the field of computer science education has highlighted that many students lack on problem solving and computational thinking skills. These issues provoke questions in the academic community as to whether the learning methodology of introductory to programming courses is appropriate. As regards the pedagogical procedure in general, the teacher-centered model was amended with the introduction of Interactive Learning Environments, which promote distributed learning. In this paper, we examine the fundamental skills needed for introductory to programming courses. Additionally, we focus on some of the most popular micro worlds and evaluate them in terms of educational suitability.

AB  - The process of implementing coding at schools attended by pupils from six to fourteen years of age is a current trend in developed countries. In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.

AB  - The two-system theory of human thinking process is applied to the radio propagation modeling and prediction. System 1 corresponds to a quick and intuitive estimation of propagation parameters such as path losses and angles of arrival/departure. System 2 is a more deliberate process that takes more time to ‘think’ and provides more accurate results. In this paper we describe the necessary components of a two-system propagation modeling framework, present initial results, and discuss the challenges.

AB  - Summary <p>This chapter details what is involved in Produce, the second stage of any Critical Systems Practice (CSP) intervention. Produce is concerned with the design of an appropriate intervention strategy based on the learning derived from Explore. It continues to carry forward the commitments of Critical Systems Thinking (CST) by selecting appropriate systems methodologies, models and methods that will later be used in a pluralist fashion to drive multifaceted improvement in a situation of interest. The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described &#x2013; engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as &#x2018;dominant&#x2019; at different times to steer interventions. Finally, some possible objections to what Produce suggests are discussed.</p>

It means the constructive behavior and values of humanity need to be the part of Artificial intelligence by incorporating wisdom. These can be demonstrates by simulating thought process and hence thinking ability of human beings is recognized as the consciousness. Currently researchers are working on thoughts and consciousness. These thoughts are coexisted with the particular mental factor. Abhidhamma model of ancient Indian literature are claimed 52 mental factors which are categorized in basic three classes such as Ethically Variable Factor, Unwholesome Factor and Beautiful Factor. Proposed model demonstrates the classification of the mental states. Dataset consists of 445 samples collected from various respondents by asking three questions. Preprocessing is performed by using the techniques of Natural language processing and Non-axiomatic logic. Convolutional Neural Network Machine learning technique applied to classify the mental factors. Performance of the proposed system is measured by applying statistical measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, Recall and F1-Score. Accuracy for small and large database is obtained as 86.92 percent and 93.02 percent respectively.

AB  - Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.

AB  - Graduate students at the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies (UMD iSchool) collaborated in interdisciplinary teams on a case study to explore application of computational methodologies to datafied collections related to slavery in the Maryland State Archives (MSA). Two research questions were examined: (1) What are the opportunities and limitations for using computational methods and open source tools to characterize data encoded within records of enslavement and to discover new patterns and relationships in that data? (2) How does knowledge of social and cultural systems impact those opportunities and limitations? Computational methods and tools were most effectively used when socio-cultural contextualization and technology's role as a mediator of representation were taken into account. Three additional technical research areas are identified to enhance recovery of heritage hidden in records of enslavement: visualization, graph databases, and ontologies and metadata.

AB  - Trust based situation awareness represents the flow of information regarding a situation within a group of agents based on their mutual trust. Situation Awareness (SA) in general is regarded as basis for efficient group decision making while trust based situation awareness is of utmost importance in safety critical systems as the trust is a key factor that tend to affect the beliefs of agents that are collaborating in an environment. In this study an existing model of situation awareness is extended to incorporate mutual trust of the participating agents. The proposed model is analyzed using two different paradigms of computational modeling techniques namely Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Population Based Modeling (PBM). Various experiments are conducted using variety of populations. Results show that with incorporation of trust factor, both approaches show similar patterns with large population size. In addition to that, relation between SA and trust is analyzed and the results show that SA gets affected by the inter-agent trust.

AB  - It is recognized that the key theoretical and technical problems toward the next generation internet are not only a speed issue, but also a more fundamental issue of the increasingly demands for the sharing of computational intelligent capabilities. According to cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC) [3, 9, 10, 15], which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics [6, 12], such as concept algebra [7], system algebra [17], realtime process algebra [4, 8], granular algebra [12], and visual semantic algebra [11]. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.

AB  - A study was carried out which examined the extent to which young people aged 11-12, with no prior instruction in programming, are able to write computational rules which govern play in a 3D computer role-playing game. Expressing these rules required the use of common computational structures such as conditionals, sets and loops. We analysed the rules written for their structure and style, and recorded the types of errors made. It was found that although young people were able to abstract away from the game play experience, very few of the rules were error-free. The most common errors were errors of omission (leaving elements out that should have been included) rather than errors of commission (including elements which should not be part of the rule). These findings have implications for the design of the Flip language, which aims to support young people as they begin to develop computational skills through game design.

AB  - Cognitive Computing is a developing paradigm with its applications found in almost every field. It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.

AB  - Our qualitative research was inspired by the 75-year long Harvard University Happiness Survey.In October-November 2022, 65 young marketing undergraduates from Generation Z were asked what value and happiness meant to them. Today’s 20-year-olds were forced to live one tenth of their lives, i.e., 2 years, locked in their homes, isolated from friends and university peers, during the COVID -19 pandemic. Hardly had they recovered from the threat of the pandemic, from their grief, when they were hit by another trauma, as were other members of society. War in neighbouring Ukraine, serious energy crisis, climate crisis, skyrocketing inflation, uncertain future…The focus of the research was therefore on the question of what kind of life they would be satisfied with, and what they would do to achieve the quality of life they want. What goals do they have, what do they want to achieve in their lives? Are human relationships important to them? As our interviewees were marketing students, we asked them if they were happy buying a product or using a service, how important is the experience of buying a product or service to them? How do they think about this topic, what strategy do they want to follow as marketing employees based on their life experiences? Their way of thinking is also decisive at a societal level.

AB  - Agility - like the XXI. one of the fashionable concepts and leading approaches of the 20th century - it came into the spotlight after the 2000s. At first, as a new project management methodology, it was included in the thinking, which is able to eliminate the shortcomings and slowness of the classic waterfall model, thus making project management more efficient, directing them towards successful projects. Seeing the success of agile project management, more and more companies and businesses began to agileize their various organizational units as well, and finally the mindset spread to the whole organization. Today, we interpret the concept of agility not only at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, the willingness of individuals and employees to agility differs along a number of factors. It is influenced by an individual's age, generation affiliation, education, culture, which determines the extent to which he or she is able to embrace this new way of thinking. In our study, we look for the answer to what agility means as a term in the reading of respondents of each generation. The basis of our study is a questionnaire research carried out in Hungary, which was also part of an international research.

However, understanding the meaning of these prompts in AI remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for extracting Cartoon images via UML Models based on natural language-based specifications, mapping a cut image's cartoon elements with UML properties extracted through linguistic textual analysis in software engineering. We expect software engineers to automatically help toon writers generate a cartoon's image with linguistic mechanisms.

AB  - In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.

We demonstrate this combo-design idea with examples of roleplaying, Snap! program, and Python code. Our design pattern and examples could be adapted to other suitable children’s activities in different school settings on a variety of technology platforms.

There are advantages in many aspects, but traditional competitive thinking should still be the dominant training method." At the same time, the degree of similarity of the team’s competitive thinking model has different effects on team performance obvious to see. When the basketball team’s overall competitive thinking pattern is more similar, team performance is also more significant.

AB  - Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.

AB  - The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students’ English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.

AB  - Automatic grading systems help lessen the load of manual grading. Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.

AB  - This paper proposes the synthesis of Petri net supervisors based on a think-globally-actlocally (TGAL) approach and a vector covering technique for flexible manufacturing systems. Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel framework that melds the profound tenets of Indian philosophy with AI and ML. Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.

AB  - Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.

AB  - Design is a creative, complex, and iterative process. Although a variety of AI models for supporting design has been developed, there is little research on providing a seamless flow across multiple AI models, as well as the inspiration evolution within the process. We present an integrated AI-based Creativity Support Tool(AI-CST) that systematically integrates multiple AI models and contains a novel Inpiration Evolver to facilitate collaboration between designers and AI models. A between-subject sneaker-design experiment comparing our integrated AI-CST and non-integrated AI-CST shows that our AI-CST can significantly improve designers’ performance. Different using preferences and evolution styles have been discovered by the Inspiration Evolver, which inspires further study on the adaptation of the integrated AI-CST.

The introducing issue is role of knowledge in product modeling considering main schema of product definition. Definition of knowledge for indirect communication between engineers by the interpretation of product model is discussed through human thinking driven product definition, sources of human intent at product definition, and concept of extension of product definition to information content. A concept is shown for the modeling of advising background knowledge as information content considering engineering objects in real world product structure. A new multilevel product model is detailed. In this model, enhanced human intent based decision making is assisted by organized engineering object information and information content on levels of product model. Finally, some future plans are outlined for the work that is devoted as a contribution to intelligent product modeling for the every day engineering in product lifecycle management (PLM) systems.

AB  - The paper outlines some direct solution strategies for sparse matrices arising from the finite element (FE) discretization of electromagnetic (EM) models, and explores whether the conventional thinking followed by highly optimized direct method tools for sparse matrices is indeed the best available option for directly solving FEM problems in EM. Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.

AB  - The use of microorganisms for the production of industrially important compounds and enzymes is becoming increasingly important. Eukaryotes have been less widely used than prokaryotes in biotechnology, because of the complexity of their genomic structure and biology. The Yeast2.0 project is an international effort to engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to make it easy to manipulate, and to generate random variants using a system called SCRaMbLE. SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published. Our simulator can be applied to the analysis of the fitness landscapes of any organism for which SCRaMbLE has been implemented.

In these kinds of monitoring systems the patient-specific evaluation is essential to obtain realistic result thereby making use of the system more secure. This requirement is fulfilled by the risk assessment framework published by the author and her colleagues. However, it is also equally important to obtain the accurate result in time to avoid the serious consequences. In order to address this problem in this paper the author presents some evaluation structure reduction techniques which reduce the computational need of the risk assessment. These models are the modifications of the conventional Mamdani-type inference system maintaining its advantageous properties while the computational complexity is reduced and the result is equivalent to the conventional system result.

AB  - Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.

AB  - Computational creativity is defined as the ability of artificial systems to generate artifacts with substantial novelty and originality, comparable to those crafted by human experts. This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Adaptive Brain-Inspired Emotional Decayed Learning named Fuzzy ADBEL. Fuzzy ADBEL is a computational model that models the forgetting process and inhibitory mechanism of the emotional brain. In the model, the fuzzy decay rate simulates the forgetting process, and the stimulus and learning weights are considered as fuzzy variables trained by fuzzy learning rules. The final output of the model is evaluated by a fuzzy decision making layer that simulates the inhibitory mechanism. The proposed Fuzzy ADBEL is utilized to predict the Kp, AE and Dst indices showing opposite behaviors and characterizing the chaotic activity of the earth's magnetosphere. Experimental results show that fuzzy approaches including Fuzzy ADBEL and ANFIS (Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System) reaches steady state faster than non-fuzzy approaches, ADBEL and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Hence, we hope the proposed model can be used in real time chaotic time series prediction.

AB  - Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore.

AB  - The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility.

AB  - Implementing a virtual production system is challenging. Production systems are constrained by different dynamical market changes and characterised by complex general and machine specific interactions, uncertainties and unknowns. These complications make predicting the behaviour by any deterministic computer model not only inaccurate but sometimes misleading, e.g. if the range of a model's applicability is not sufficiently well identified. Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence. The theory of design oriented thinking adapted for manufacturing favours fast iteration in digitised design cycles instead of optimisation of model quality in one step.

AB  - We are investigating how non-programmers make sense and solve simple computational problems. We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept.

AB  - Membrane Computing (MC) or so called P system is a computing machine that was first introduced by Gheorghe Paun in 1998. MC; being inspired from biological reactions occurring inside a living cell; represents a new methodology for writing algorithms and for thinking. In this paper we borrow some immunity flavor and add it to the framework of MC. The new addition is a way of thinking and designing MC algorithms. It eliminates the need for a checking phase in an MC algorithm. There can be many interpretations for the concept of adding Immunity to P systems. In this paper, one interpretation is introduced in which Immunity is interpreted as a set of rules that protects membranes against generation or evolution of unwanted objects. Hence; it is guaranteed that if the system developed an answer then it is correct otherwise the final step will be reached with no membranes.

AB  - The power systems of the future - smart grids - will see an increase in both renewable energy sources and load demand, thus increasing the need for fast dynamic reconfiguration of system parameters to handle energy and load dispatches. Power systems will need to be monitored continuously to maintain stability under normal and abnormal operating conditions and when facing disturbances. A combination of system state prediction, dynamic power flow, system optimization, and solution stability checking will allow for a more reliable, affordable, efficient and clean power grid. The optimization and control systems on a smart grid will require a computational systems thinking capability to handle the uncertainties and variability that exist in a smart grid environment. The concept of sense-making based on computational intelligence methods, including neural networks, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, as well as online measurements from a smart grid to provide `situational' awareness in the context of stability, is introduced in this paper.

AB  - Computational creative systems have the potential to augment the creative design process, particularly in co-creative contexts. We present a computational model for generating visual conceptual blends in the domain of sketching. Our system is motivated by the desire to encourage curiosity, facilitate creative ideation, and overcome design fixation. We start with a model for “conceptual shift”: when a sketch recognized as belonging to one category is visually similar to a sketch from a semantically distinct category. Identifying a potential conceptual shift enables visual analogy and/or conceptual blending. The intent is that these conceptually shifted or blended sketches could be presented to designers to encourage analogical reasoning and creative outcomes. We define and demonstrate our model for the conceptual shift task and alternative approaches for enabling conceptual blends. We describe future plans for evaluation in co-creative contexts.

AB  - This WIP exposes the design and implementation of Midroid, an open mobile platform focused on microcontrollers' education. The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers; area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform.

AB  - Globally, women account for a small percentage of students and professionals in ICT-related fields. In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.

AB  - Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.

AB  - This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.

AB  - Denial and wishful thinking are well known affective phenomena that influence human belief processes. Put simply, they consist of tendencies to disbelieve what one would not like to be true, and believe what one would like to be true. We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.

AB  - “The basis of computer hardware technology” is a public basic course of engineering in colleges and universities, the course content has a strong theoretical, engineering and practical nature. In the past, teaching mainly focus on the professional knowledge and skills, lacking in the cultivation of thinking, philosophy, politics and humanistic quality. In this paper, we make a preliminary exploration on the teaching design of curriculum ideological and political education in “The basis of computer hardware technology” course, and the ADDIE model is introduced to integrate the elements of ideological and political in classroom lectures, after-school assignments, course experiments and examinations, through the combination of “knowledge transfer and value guidance” by taking professional knowledge education as the carrier, to further improve students' scientific and humanistic qualities, to establish students' sound moral principles and deep national sentiments, to promote students' all-round development, and to meet the needs of talent cultivation.

AB  - Virtual Experiment (VE) plays an important role for fostering the student's high-level thinking and problem-solving abilities. Accordingly, VE has become the popular method to assist teachers in science teaching and students in practicing due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive of the Real Experiment (RE). However, the teaching and learning performance may be limited because the most of the existing VE systems cannot efficiently, automatically analyze and diagnose the students' VE operational portfolio. Therefore, this study proposes a Virtual Experiment Diagnosis Scheme (VEDS) to automatically diagnose the operational portfolio based on teacher-defined diagnostic knowledge and further to offer students the Visualized Personalized Diagnostic Report to describe the learning problems with suggestion for fostering the self-learning and experiment abilities.

AB  - In this paper, we present our design of a high school summer course which uses our Visual Design Problem-based Learning Pedagogy using Virtual Environments as a strategy to teach computer science. Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment. These creations were further explored and refined in immersive display systems fostering embodied learning and remote peer presence and support. To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses. This work may have a positive impact on computer science education by increasing engagement, knowledge acquisition, and self-directed learning.

AB  - The human brain is at least a factor of 1 billion more efficient than our present digital technology, and a factor of 10 million more efficient than the best digital technology that we can imagine today. The unavoidable conclusion is that we have something fundamental to learn from the human brain about a new and much more effective form of computation, with a convenient, effective, efficient and reliable bottom-up (BU) approach. In another paper presented at this conference we focused on the computational information conservation properties of optimized numeric words with precisation of meaning. Here, we present a brain-inspired geometric-logical scheme defining fundamental human linguistic and predicative competence. According to CICT, complete duality of Opposition and Implication Geometry in Logical Geometry and Language can model n-dimensional predicative competence and beyond, according to available computational resources. In any case, their combination may provide even a concrete opportunity for the foundation of computational psychiatry and for reformulating psychoanalytical theory in a sharable way.

AB  - Since 2014, nearly 2 million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape an economically devastated country during what is one of the largest humanitarian crises in modern history. Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.

To address this problem, we study its computational complexity and formulate a binary integer linear programming (BILP) for an exact resolution, which meets IC targets and minimizes the total cost of the schedule for the selected actions. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, a numerical example based on a French textile company is considered.

A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science are used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations of corresponding activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational science and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vigor and empirical approach without the support of a formal model and a rigorous means. In order to formally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of the brain are sought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of the natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of the cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as , inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.

AB  - The use of computer programming in K-12 spread into schools worldwide in the 70s and 80s of the last century, but it disappeared from the educational landscape in the early 90s. With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.

AB  - Robotics is now increasingly popular in the education system worldwide as it is one of the core technology enablers for Industry 4.0. Robotics is deemed to be able to promote students' STEM interest and 21st century skills. However, not all the students have the access to robotics, especially in Sibu, East Malaysia. This research presents the implementation of a low-cost Maker Uno educational robotics kit and its associated learning experience of the learners, which were seventy-six Foundation in Science (FIS) students in University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS). The aim of this study is to investigate the students' empirical STEM robotics learning experience by offering them an opportunity to explore a low-cost self-assembled robotics car. Questionnaire and interviews that constitute a mixed method research were employed to investigate the present situation and derive at a solution to the problem. The findings showed that the proposed robotics activities were beneficial for the students to exercise 21st century skills and cultivate STEM interests. Educators could potentially benefit from applying this robotics pedagogical exemplary to help the students to cultivate STEM interests and 21st century skills. Future research on innovation exemplary, particularly on low-cost robotics applications and robotics education methods can be explored.

AB  - Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.

AB  - People often encounter highly stressful, emotion-evoking situations. Modeling and predicting people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus's theory of coping into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation. We also conducted a series of controlled experiments simulating a hurricane experience to investigate how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results support the model's assumptions showing that the proposed features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation.

AB  - The kind of students that currently arrive in the classroom in this technological age require a learning model that promotes their motivation for learning and thus boosts their creative thinking skills to develop disciplinary and cross-cutting competencies in their courses. It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.

AB  - Holon is a powerful metaphor which captures the recursive structure of biological systems and the organization of their decision processes arranged at various granularity abstraction levels. From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings.

AB  - The cooperative coevolution (CC) framework achieves a promising performance in solving large scale global optimization problems. The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art CC frameworks.

AB  - Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.

AB  - In this research, we report the empirical findings of a vignette study designed to examine how volitional computer users cope with information technology (IT) threats based on the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT). We incorporate the construct of wishful thinking, an important form of emotion-focused coping behavior that is rarely studied, along with problem-focused coping into a research model to examine the interaction between the two coping approaches. The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users' security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.

AB  - As more and more developed ICT devices appear more and more frequently, these become natural attributes of life for the contemporary “digital generation”. For the generation which grew up in the e-world, it was natural that their everyday activities were tied to the possibilities offered by the networks. These challenges could not leave the pedagogical science cold either. It tried to comply with the generation challenges from the very beginning. It tried to “borrow” those technical devices, theories and methods, which were already applied successfully by other fields of science, adjusting its own learning methods, teaching and learning models and learning environments to them. In our article, we try to draw a parallel between the system of engineering and pedagogy. Furthermore, we would like to map the new trends of pedagogy, which are possible on the basis of the logics of engineering.

AB  - This paper examines the assembly of interdisciplinary teams in emerging scientific fields. We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.

AB  - Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.

AB  - This work is the result of an investigation carried out within the framework of a research grant. The work experience that this team carried out was aimed at describing and systematizing the configuration of computational thinking, its incidence and validity in the educational field from the analysis of public policies, from an interdisciplinary approach. The experience carried out was developed based on a bibliographic and documentary analysis work, which allowed recovering the concept of computational thinking to analyze it in conjunction with the development of critical pedagogical practice and the concept of competences. Here an analysis of some of the current debates presented by computational thinking and its teaching is presented in order to promote a line of dialogue and problematization between what was done, is done and is projected on this subject.

AB  - Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.

AB  - In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency. EPM and ITS can also contribute to AI and cognitive informatics, helping to develop autonomous reasoning system for person-centered learning and training to predicative competence and decision making.

AB  - The pace of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to healthcare has been speeding up. Many of the initiatives have been technology driven aiming at finding problems matching the new technology while systematic, demand driven search for solutions has been limited. Here we describe the process of identifying opportunities for deploying artificial intelligence to healthcare and social services on regional and national levels in Finland. The process includes idea generation and elaboration using a design thinking method complemented with architectural design for identifying required AI capabilities for the 34 best use cases. In this paper, we focus on the development of use case “Mobile Solution for Home Care Coordination and Communication” to observe the evolving balance of technology push and demand pull faced in the process.
