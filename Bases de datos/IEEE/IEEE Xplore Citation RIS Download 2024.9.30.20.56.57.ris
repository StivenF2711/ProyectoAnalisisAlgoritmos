AB  - The Chinese house market has been flourishing in the past three decades as an increasingly bigger population moves into cities. To keep the rise of house price within a proper range and acceptable to the public, the government has adopted various approaches to bring the price under control. After intermittent fluctuations, house purchasing has become a hot topic for both the media and the public. It is of great significance to study the change of house price considering all the related factors. Some scientists prefer machine learning. Machine learning is a subject which involves many subjects such as probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, and algorithm complexity theory. In this paper, we will discuss the details of the machine learning algorithms, three typical models (i.e., AdaBoost, Linear Regression and KNN) and their strengths and weaknesses. In the future, the growing complexity of all the factors that influence house price will cause more and more trouble for scientists pursuing more precise results. Also, based on its own specialty that computer is still not able to think like a man, machine learning cannot achieve 100% right, which often results in some silly outcomes.

AB  - Many companies have used the Scrum framework for system and product development. In the implementation of the scrum framework, we often encounter obstacles and challenges in the field, one of them is a sense of belonging to the team’s work itself. The scrum team should act on their own and already know what to do on each sprint. They are already committed to what they think can be accomplished and can be helped by feeling ownership of the work they do each sprint. If the Scrum team is committed to the work to be carried out, over time it will certainly foster a sense of ownership within the Scrum team itself, including satisfaction with the results they have achieved. The most important thing to a Scrum Team is to remember, that the team is to take ownership of themselves. They are responsible for their own accountability, If they are to be truly self-directed. A lot of research has been done to determine the maturity level of a scrum team with their respective methods such as the Scrum Maturity Model and Agile Maturity Model but not related to team ownership.

AB  - Fracturing sand control is a complex sand prevention method. There are so many influence factors which can not be modeled by the structuring models in both the decision and the operation process. Expert system for the optimization design of the fracturing sand control can simulate the thinking patterns of those experts, collect the computer knowledge and models in the field, apply the fuzzy mathematics to the project design, deal with the uncertain parameters using fuzzy set theory, and qualify such parameters to achieve analogy reasoning. Thus, an intelligent analysis system is established, which can carry out analogy analysis and decision making based on the cases in engineering database and experiences in knowledge base, modify the parameters related to fracturing sand control by comparing different operation parameters and analogy reasoning, select the reasonable operation parameters, provide the feasible operation project, perform evaluation on the project and forecast the final result. Such a system can eliminate the hidden troubles during the operation, improve the scientific value of the operation and ensure the operation quality.

AB  - The existing neural networks mainly involve working memory in the memory module, which can basically meet the needs of a neural network at work. However, for human intelligence, working memory is far from meeting the needs, especially in some advanced activities, such as thinking, language and emotion. Based on the concept driven processing theory, that is, the top-down processing mode of human perception, and the dualprocess theory of attention, that is, automatic processing and control processing based on the cognitive resource theory, this paper puts forward the computer neural network long-term memory storage model and the computer neural network dualprocess model, in order to construct the long-term memory of computer neural network, reduce the loss of computing time and computing resources, and improve the processing rate of information. It provides the possibility for the realization of neural network in automatic processing, subconscious judgment and other activities, as well as high-level activities such as self-control, strategy formulation and organization planning.

AB  - When it comes to scene classification, the lack of labelled data is a significant obstacle that forces researchers to think about innovative solutions. This work presents a revolutionary method to strengthen scene classification models by combining transfer learning with AI-generated images. A key component of this project is the construction of a carefully curated dataset of 3672 augmented AI-generated photos in a total of 6 scenes. This database not only serves as a helpful resource for additional research but also makes a substantial contribution to this area of research. Using this dataset, a VGG16 model is trained, demonstrating the usefulness of synthetic data with a notable increase in accuracy. The model's performance is further improved through subsequent training using realistic photos through transfer learning, thereby surpassing the initial baseline. This work demonstrates the transformative effect of transfer learning on scene categorization accuracy and verifies its effectiveness using synthetic data through rigorous testing and evaluation. The results open the door for AI-generated photos to be used as an effective approach to address data scarcity issues in scene classification, which will help real-world applications improve.

AB  - Floods cause havoc in many regions of India every year during the monsoon season. However, commuters really do not really think of the after effects caused by the floods. Commuting during water-logging is risky because the depth of logged water cannot be determined. This can lead to cars and bikes getting stuck inside the flooded zone. Thus travelling through such areas can lead to loss of life. Our paper focuses on the classification of floodwater depth. We propose a deep-learning model that classifies the depth of the flood water level into different categories according to the depth. In this paper, we have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images given as an input by the user/commuter. For better user accessibility we propose to integrate the model with a cross-platform app that would be convenient for the commuters; along with an in-app alert system, which notifies other users about the location where the water level is above threshold value.

AB  - Machine learning models have achieved significant milestones in various domains, for example, computer vision models have an exceptional result in object recognition, and in natural language processing, where Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT can start a conversation with human-like proficiency. However, abstract reasoning remains a challenge for these models, “Can AI really thinking like a human?” still be a question yet to be answered. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a metric designed to assess human reasoning capabilities. It presents a series of eight images as a problem set, where the participant should try to discover the underlying rules among these images and select the most appropriate image from eight possible options that best completes the sequence. This task always be used to test human reasoning abilities and IQ. Zhang et al proposed a dataset called RAVEN [12] which can be used to test Machine Learning model abstract reasoning ability. In this paper, we purposed Vision Transformer Contrastive Network which build on previous work with the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPiNet), which set a new benchmark for permutation-invariant models Raven's Progressive Matrices by incorporating “contrast effects” from psychology, cognition, and education, and extends this foundation by leveraging the cutting-edge Vision Transformer architecture. This integration aims to further refine the machine's ability to process and reason about spatial-temporal information from pixel-level inputs and global wise features on RAVEN dataset.

AB  - Understanding the connections of different electronic components is key to understanding how a circuit works. Classroom activities presented in this paper provide a first approach to a widely used engineering model, such as “two-pole network”. The didactic proposal aims to develop solving skills for pencil and paper problems, for assembling and measuring circuits with real components, for reverse engineer of assembled circuit and allows the incorporation of some design elements. The experiences are presented on a basic technology class of first year of engineer career, in which different configuration of black boxes with four accessible test points are used as two-pole network. Student interest is observed in class as they get actively involved in learning of circuits. Thus development possibilities of thinking skills get opened, such as analyzing, predicting, evaluating, among others. From perception, the Incorporation of experiential knowledge is facilitated. This open the way to a theoretical knowledge with a higher degree of abstraction. Once the student has measured, interpreted, proposed alternative models, and has contrasted models with specific configuration, he will have some conceptual tools to address more complex systems.

AB  - With the development of computer technology, people’s thinking mode has also changed dramatically. 3D animation and virtual reality (VR) technology can be seen everywhere around people. With the development of technology, 3D animation and VR technology are applied in more and more fields, such as education, medical treatment and commerce. Under the background of increasing international competition, the update speed of high-tech is changing with each passing day. With the wide application of VR technology by modern people, the 3D animation industry has been further developed. The effective combination of 3D animation scene graphic design and VR technology can further improve the overall perfection of 3D animation scene design. This paper improves the lighting model and shadow rendering algorithm according to the defects of the general lighting rendering algorithm in the application of 3D animation scenes. Based on this, a hybrid 3D scene lighting rendering algorithm is obtained. When optimizing the Cook Torrance lighting model, a geometric attenuation factor algorithm is used, and when improving the shadow rendering algorithm, a light shadow rendering algorithm based on variance shadow is used.

AB  - There are more and more electromagnetic compatibility problems contributing to safety related errors, malfunctions and other failures in Chinese High Speed Railway. However, the classical EMC test and theory does not take into account risk analysis of EMC especially in safety critical systems. In order to help engineers to solve the EMC problems systematically, a method with risk assessment and management thinking is used in this paper. First the study proposes an EMC Risk Analysis Model (EMCRAM) based on the Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM) with four levels. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is introduced to calculate the risk of EMC faults when the risk value of the indices is obtained with the method of EMC measurement and experts' knowledge and experience. To demonstrate the approach, it is validated by an application of railway signal system and the results show the EMC risk and vulnerability in the railway signal system.

AB  - This paper affords a hybrid forecasting scheme for time series prediction in head-primarily based aggregation clusters. The proposed version combines multiple individual predictors in a manner that permits each to capture heterogeneous characteristics of the time series and think of each of the temporal and spatial dimensions within the enter statistics. An aggregation step is also included to construct cluster distributions to enhance prediction accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated on actual datasets with recognition of each temporal and spatial dimension. Results display the effectiveness of the proposed technique in predicting destiny values of time collection with accuracy higher than individual predictions. Further, the model also can cope with minor adjustments within the shape of facts, allowing for excessive flexibility within the analysis and forecasting procedure. It explores the ability of hybrid predictions of time collection in head-based total aggregation clusters. It provides a complete time collection evaluation, forecasting the usage of an aggregate of records mining and device-getting-to-know techniques. The paper introduces the vital standards and techniques for an adequate time series forecasting version. A hybrid prediction model consisting of the Autoregressive included shifting standard (ARIMA) model and the Weighted Neighbourhood common (WNA) model is then explored. The efficacy of the version is statistically tested on an artificial dataset with constant natural and seasonal time series additives and on one actual-global dataset with a vast range of correlated time collection. Compared to classic forecasting fashions, the effects demonstrate that a hybrid prediction version produces drastically higher accuracy and offers an extra sensible representation of the device's behavior. The paper evaluates hybrid prediction fashions to alternative strategies and a few viable future development directions.

AB  - In this paper, we present our work towards scene understanding based on modeling the scene prior to understanding its content. We describe the environment representation model used, the Stixel World, and its benefits for compact scene representation. We show our preliminary results of its application in a diverse environment and the limitations reached in our experiments using imaging systems. We argue that this method has been developed in an ideal scenario and does not generalise well to uncommon changes in the environment. We also found that this method is sensitive to the quality of the stereo rectification and the calibration of the optics, among other parameters, which makes it time-consuming and delicate to prepare in real-time applications. We think that pixel-wise semantic segmentation techniques can address some of the shortcomings of the concept presented in a theoretical discussion.

AB  - This chapter considers what looks different in a world where risk is explicit within the context of computer‐to‐computer interactions. It presents some of the key concepts and tools as a summary: trustor/trustee separation, trust relationship description, virtualisation and trust, and trust domains. The flip side of thinking about the trust relationships that one system will form to other systems is for architect to consider the place of the system as a trustee: the recipient or target of those trust relationships. A key point is that the architect of trustee system should aim to have a good understanding of not only the functional uses to which the system may be put but also the trust contexts and risk concerns of potential trustors. Trust and risk lurk in all areas of the field of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest supercomputer, from wind turbines to online gaming, and from financial markets to educational institutions.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly. Schizophrenia detection using Electroencephalography is an en-grossing area of neuroscience. There are several researches reported on designing effective models which can detect schizophre-nia accurately, however, existing models are either complex or use an extensive number of waves to process for detecting schizophre-nia accurately. Addressing the issues mentioned above, this work presents a lightweight Schizophrenia detection model with the help of Gamma wave extraction from the electroencephalogram brain waves. The proposed model has approximately 12500 parameters with an accuracy of 99.5 % which is much lighter than the previous state-of-the-art models that contain nearly 11 million parameters. We also presented a detailed comparative result analysis among all the state-of-the-art models with the proposed model which shows the effectiveness of our proposed model.

AB  - In this paper, the conception extension of parallel execution model in layered idea for parallel computation model research is proposed, in which not only compiling and optimal running are included, but also partial parallel programming for parallelizing the program execution. Breaking through the thinking set of parallel algorithm design and parallel programming, an actual problem, the numerical weather prediction post-processing system, is parallelized by using a job-level parallel method. By parallelizing the execution of program, the wall-time of post-processing system is decreased evidently and ideal parallel efficiency is obtained. This case can be regarded as a paradigm of extensions of parallel execution model.

AB  - Providing high quality recommendations is significant for e-commerce systems to assist users in making effective selection decisions from a plethora of choices. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most well-known and successful techniques to generate recommendations. However, CF suffers from an inherent issue that does not think over the auxiliary information such as item content information. This paper proposes an approach to combine the similarity of auxiliary information with the similarity of items based on user-item ratings. Specifically, due to the high dimensions and linear correlation of the auxiliary information, this paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension to improve the predictive accuracy. In addition, Pearson correlation is better than the Euclidean distance as the similarity measurement to predict accuracy of preference value through the analysis of the different experimental results. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Nowadays, enterprises survive in a competitive environment. Logistics is looked as “the third profit source” which has big potential in reducing the cost of operations. Especially inventory and transportation occupy a considerable proportion in logistics cost. So reduce the cost becomes the key to reduce it. However, China's enterprises consider how to reduce transport cost or inventory cost only, ignoring the relation between the two parts, making the logistics systemic operating cost high. The paper takes full consideration of antinomies of transportation and inventory cost and use systemic thinking to low the operating cost in order to provide a solution to the two costs.

To address this problem and figure out the unknowns hidden in educational datasets, this paper proposes the historical views navigation though similarity and closeness centrality based recommendation. In this approach, the useful intermediate views or the views interested by users are saved as history and compared with the current view. By analyzing the similarity between them and the closeness centrality measure, the most relative historical views are recommended to the user. Finally, the user study shows that most of the participants are interested in our work. They think it's helpful and will continue to use it.

AB  - Maize crops get hit hard by corn rust, a big disease that affects farming all over the world's food production. Traditional ways of finding diseases and putting them in groups are basic, but often limited by what people think about it. They don't work well when needed for a large number of cases. This study shows a new method using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is deep learning (DL). It helps to correctly identify the degree of damage from corn rust disease. The study shows that the MLP model works well in finding and classifying disease stages using a set of 3500 and pictures from six levels. The MLP model was carefully made and taught to recognize small changes in disease levels. It puts importance on being right, exact, and remembering everything about it all the time. The machine reached 94.20% accuracy, showing it could be useful for people working with plants and those who farm. The MLP was faster, more scalable, and gave better results than other computer learning methods. It did a great job! This study aids the increasing mix of artificial intelligence and farming that's precise. It shows how DL can help solve tough agriculture problems. The results show that the MLP model can help manage crop diseases. It helps in quick and effective actions to stop these problems from causing more harm. For the future, we want to make the model stronger. We also plan on using it for other sicknesses and adding it to farming systems that check things in real-time right away. The research opens the door for better farming methods that are both green and save energy, driven by smart machines.

AB  - Proper Pronunciation is essential for a successful career. In the present era, recruiters do not want mug pots or rote learners i.e one that scores well in the technical or the core area. The need of the hour demands a holistic personality which must include good communication skills, critical thinking, managerial skills & logical reasoning. In the present study, the researchers have studied the mother tongue influence (MTI) in the English language spoken by the regional speakers of the Kumaun region. In the present study, the researchers have observed that the students of Uttarakhand have high MTI (Mother Tongue Influence) which is noticeable in their communication. They face difficulty in articulation of certain consonant sounds like sh (ꭍ), v, w, etc. Words like sheep /ꭍi:p/ are mispronounced as seep /si:p/, career/kₔriₔ/ as carrier /kᵆriₔ/ (Kay-rier). Due to poor pronunciation, they face challenges not only in the recruitment process but also in survival in Multi-National Companies where the American / British accent is widely used. The researchers conducted a diagnostic test to identify the extent and frequency of flaws in the articulation of words. It was observed that the performance of the regional learners was poor and required improvement. They implemented a Pre-Defined Algorithm model for improving the performance of the regional students. It was followed by a post-implementation test which was conducted through the proposed model. The proposed model has a better outcome concerning reducing the MTI in general pronunciation of the English Language among Kumauoni speakers of Uttarakhand.

AB  - This unprecedented time of the COVID-19 outbreak challenged the status-quo whether it is on business operation, political leadership, scientific capability, engineering implementation, data analysis, and strategic thinking, in terms of resiliency, agility, and innovativeness. Due to some identified constraints, while addressing the issue of global health, human ingenuity has proven again that in times of crisis, it is our best asset. Constraints like limited testing capacity and lack of real-time information regarding the spread of the virus, are the highest priority in the mitigation process, aside from the development of vaccines and the pushing through of vaccination programs. Using the available Chest X-Ray Images dataset and an AI-Computer Vision Technique called Convolutional Neural Network, features of the images were extracted and classified as COVID-19 positive or not. This paper proposes the usage of the 18-layer Residual Neural Network (ResNet-18) as an architecture instead of other ResNet with a higher number of layers. The researcher achieves the highest validation accuracy of 99.26%. Moving forward, using this lower number of layers in training a model classifier, resolves the issue of device constraints such as storage capacity and computing resources while still assuring highly accurate outputs.

AB  - In the modern information age, computers, multimedia and various technologies influence people's learning to a very large degree. College English teaching is no exception. “College English Curriculum Requirements” issued by Ministry of Education emphasize the importance of applying modern information technology into college English teaching, changing the traditional teaching system and constructing the multimedia- and network-based teaching model. However, the mere application of these information technologies is far from enough. Some problems have already appeared. So it is very necessary to take some guiding theories into consideration. Embodied philosophy puts special stress on the spirit of “people first”, which brings important inspiration for college English teaching. Starting from the perspective of embodied philosophy, the paper explores the essence of English teaching. That is “interactive experience”, which can be divided into three parts: with what to experience, what to experience first and how to experience. It hopes to activate teachers' and students' thinking and experience, in order to make computer-assisted college English teaching more practical and effective.

AB  - Queuing network techniques are effective for evaluating the performance of computer systems. We discuss a queuing network technique for computer systems in finite input source. The finite number of terminals exist in the network and a job in the network moves to the server that includes CPU, I/O equipment and memory after think-time at the terminal. When the job arrives at the server, it acquires a part of memory and executes CPU and I/O processing in the server. After the job completes CPU and I/O processing, it releases the memory and goes back to its original terminal. However, when the computer system has the memory resource, the queuing network model has no product form solution and cannot be calculated the exact solutions. We proposed here an approximation queuing network technique for calculating the performance measures of computer systems with finite input source on which multiple types of jobs exist. This technique involves dividing the queuing network into two levels; one is "inner level" in which a job executes CPU and I/O processing, and the other is "outer level" that includes terminals and communication lines. By dividing the network into two levels, we can prevent the number of states of the network from increasing and approximately calculate the performance measures of the network. We evaluated the proposed approximation technique by using numerical experiments and clarified the characteristics of the system response time and the mean number of jobs in the inner level.

AB  - With the increasing number of Internet applications and frequent network interactions, the resources in the Internet show explosive growth. Under the impact of this wave, methods based on large-scale data, such as deep learning, have been put forward, and scholars have begun to think about many classical tasks from a new perspective. The LDA model is used to mine the topic information in the texts in parallel corpora, and the polynomial distribution of thesaurus is used to represent the topic, so as to judge the proportion of each document topic in the document collection. The specific words are obtained according to the polynomial distribution of the corresponding thesaurus of the topic by probability sampling. The monolingual corpus of the target language is processed by maximum likelihood estimation method, and the parallel corpus is taken as the training target. The monolingual corpus of the target language is estimated by importance sampling and full probability formula, and a machine English translation model is established. The estimated expected value is obtained by beam search method, so that English sentence translation can be realized. When disambiguating 2000 groups of random phrases, the correct rate of word sense disambiguation was 79.9%, and the correct rate of structure disambiguation was 85.7%, which was 8.6% and 3.9% higher than the original system respectively.

AB  - Neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) techniques are gradually replacing true critical thinking. These methods surpass logical and quantitative approaches because they can handle massive boundaries in massive amounts of data and dynamic behavior over time. This article lays the groundwork for adaptive traffic control by proposing ML and DL calculations for crossing point traffic flow prediction. Adaptable traffic control can be accomplished by adjusting traffic light timing based on expected flow or by controlling traffic lights partially. That is why traffic flow prediction is the only focus here. The suggested ML and DL models are created, approved, and tested using two publicly available datasets. The first one gives a total of all cars analyzed by various sensors over a 56-day period, including clocks placed at six different crossroads. The ML and DL models used in this study were developed using four out of the six crossings. Subsequently, Multi-facet Perceptron Brain Organizations (MLP-NN) dealt with Irregular Backwoods, Direct Relapse, and Stochastic Inclination; MLP-NN required less preparation time but produced better results (R-Squared and EV score of 1.93) than Intermittent Brain Organizations (RNNs), which produced excellent measurement results but required more time overall. All ML and DL computations have excellent execution results, which makes them a good fit for intelligent traffic light management.

AB  - The author discusses the following questions about the IT market: Why is the commercial IT market organized unlike other markets? That is more challenging to answer than you would think. The IT market seems to change more quickly than other industries, and it seems to use frontier technologies more often. Neither trait is unique to IT, however, financial markets change quickly. Biotech uses frontier technology. Why does the presence and combination of quick change and frontier technology seem so special to the organization of IT markets? Here is a related puzzle. Over the last five decades, many parts of computing and networking have become compartmentalized into submarkets. Specialists inhabit each category and sometimes work with specialists in other categories, and sometimes not. Sometimes a single firm works in many of those submarkets, and sometimes many independent entrepreneurs do. While compartmentalization itself is not unique to IT - the automobile supply chain possess similar features, for example - the IT market witnesses frequent rearrangement of those categories, and the leading firms therein. Sometimes it is orderly and sometimes not. How did it get to be that way? The combination of technical interdependence and technical improvement in fundamental components results in frequent restructuring and mismatches. Difficult to manage, and always entertaining to watch, no other market behaves this way. Two decades ago all the energy went into adjudicating potential abuses of leadership at Microsoft and Intel. Two decades earlier it was IBM. These days the focus stares at Alphabet/Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That kind of rapid turnover in leadership happens in no other market.

AB  - Computer-based simulation data model for the employment of business management talents in the colleges with Python implementations is studied in this paper. While improving the efficiency of education management, it is necessary to emphasize comprehensive thinking of the entire management process. Its basic idea is to use the created model to explain the changes of dependent variables with the changes of one or more independent variables, and find out the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variables through then testing the model. Besides this, the Python is adopted for the systematic implementations. Python is a pure object-oriented language that supports all object-oriented mechanisms, which makes it applicable to large-scale software project development. Using this tool, the designed model is validated through the further simulation. Compared with the other methods, our design model cam evaluate better.

AB  - To explore the application effect, problems and countermeasures of the hybrid curriculum based on MOOC+ SPOCs in `Medical Data Processing and Its Implementation in MATLAB'. In the first round of the research, 59 medical students (from the 2018 class), who participated in the course, were divided into the experimental group and the control group. The LBL teaching method and the MOOC-based hybrid curriculum teaching methods were adopted, respectively. The effectiveness of the mixed method online and offline teaching mode was measured by a satisfaction survey and by comparing the examination results of the experimental group and the control group. Then, a second round of research was carried out. Asynchronous SPOCs were built on the basis of MOOC, and this kind of hybrid curriculum teaching was adopted. The online learning behaviors of 59 medical students of 2019, who participated in the course, were also analyzed. The average score of the experimental group (84.52±5.792) was higher than that of the control group (80.08±7.815). The results of the questionnaire showed that 72.6% of the students in the experimental group were willing to accept mixed curriculum teaching based on MOOC. The results of the second round of research show that there is a positive correlation between SOPCs online course scores and final scores, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.407 (P=0.001). The final scores of the course were generally over 70 points, and there was no linear correlation between the duration of watching learning videos and scores. The hybrid curriculum teaching based on MOOC+SPOCs can improve students' computing thinking ability and the teaching effect has been proved to be effective. Students have a high degree of satisfaction with this teaching mode. However, there were still some problems need to besolved in the future.

AB  - Nowadays in several criminal cases the progress makes us to think whether justice persists. In existing system, many news, and articles state that the victim data is manipulated, and records are changed by the officials. To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure system rendering justice with transparency which makes the court decision making easy. In the proposed Justice Secure Model, the victim voice data and records are prevented from data tampering using security policies. The criminal voice data are transformed into text using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The voice data and records are secured by encrypting using Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA 256). To validate the access request, each victim records are embedded with private key. These private keys are securely transmitted by encrypting using modified AES algorithm. The above steps would avoid the internal data tampering and manipulating the victim case data. To address the external intrusion, our proposed methodology detects and prevent SQL injection attacks. Finally, to provide security of data at the server level, we have integrated multiple cloud storage system. The proposed system provide security at the application and server levels, thus making the unauthorized data access, intrusion, and data manipulation impossible.

AB  - There is no substitute to the intellectual disposition to innovate. To increase the value of creative thinking, ideas have to be transformed into wealth production through generation, promotion, and distribution of appreciated products and/or services in a timely and competitive way. To achieve these goals, philosophies of institutions and (virtual) organizations need to be nurtured to promote collective creativity and transformation of ideas into wealth production. The main objectives of the study are to explore and identify design principles for virtual innovation communities and to model innovation as an evolutionary process. A simulation study is conducted to systemically study and generate hypotheses regarding governance mechanisms that improve innovation output. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.

For most of the universe's history, space has been largely transparent, so much so that light emitted by distant galaxies can travel for billions of years before finally reaching Earth. It might seem that all researchers have to do to find out what the universe looked like, say, 10 billion years ago is to build a telescope sensitive enough to pick up that ancient light. Actually, it's more complicated than that.

AB  - This article describes how quantum systems can be used to replicate complex physical occurrences, with emphasis on the use of new quantum algorithms and special data sets. First, let's talk about how quantum computers can handle big and complex data sets that are too hard for classical computers. The focus here is on the use of quantum computing methods. The main focus of our school assignment is on developing and executing quantum algorithms specifically designed to analyze and evaluate these datasets. These quantum algorithm allows us to model a complex system. Explain the basic of tool that can be used to quantum material properties. Instructions: Change the word ‘formulas’ into another Word and rephrase the sentence accordingly. The study proposes using quantum algorithms to handle large data collections. We explain how to transform classical data to quantum representation for clearer comprehension. Also illustrated is how this encoding may yield simulated outcomes. This approach ensures precise and reliable simulations. Unlike ordinary data storage and correction, quantum computing presents various problem-solving obstacles. To remove these challenges, the simulation is made painstakingly precise and dependable. Case studies may show how quantum systems can simulate complicated situations like astronomical object motions and subatomic particle activity under harsh conditions. These case studies show that quantum simulation can address issues traditional approaches can't. Our findings might affect future study, and quantum computing could transform our knowledge of complex physical events. We also discuss quantum computing and coding's pros and cons, encouraging creative thinking in this fascinating topic.

AB  - This research deals with the analysis and detection of current mental state including feelings, emotions and mental processes from body language signs, such as analysis of personality traits, psychological states, mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction and lie detection. In this study, we discovered this new approach to classify a person's current mental state through convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the analysis of eye, mouth and hand positions. We use extensive data to train and evaluate our model, which includes video recordings and images that record various human activities and emotions. Pre-processing techniques including normalization and scaling are used to improve model reliability. We use a CNN architecture that is optimized for feature extraction from facial and hand movements and uses both spatial and temporal information from the input data. By extracting the main features of the eyes, mouth and hand positions and movements, we try to capture subtle clues that indicate different emotional states such as happiness, sadness etc., as well as cognitive processes such as thinking, imagining and creating. Experimental results show promising classification accuracy for detecting different mental states, with better performance than basic methods. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between body language and mental states, contributing to the understanding of human behaviour. The proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications, including Psychological and behaviour analysis, mental health assessment, personal user interfaces etc. This proposed model is simply an artificial intelligence based psychologist.

AB  - The accessibility of fawning and observational information over the NASA database has made a wide extend of exercises conceivable, counting the distinguishing proof of planets and the forecast of their directions for the elucidation and improvement of machine learning models. We require photographs with higher picture quality for ideal representation. Pictures of a geological range so grant the watcher a establishment for understanding how characteristics can alter both spatially and transiently. The required data almost the target regularly impacts the imaging innovation determination. Conventional imaging strategies regularly make utilize of well characterized signals, such as enthusiastic impartial molecules or photons with a restricted range run. In any case, a number of viable imaging strategies have been made for analyzing different planetary and space situations utilizing long-wavelength electromagnetic radio waves. The categorization and show of planets employing a consecutive demonstrate are hence finished in this think about exertion with the help of the dataset, which is vital for investigate purposes. Profound learning and machine learning methods are utilized to achieve this. The proposed sequential model offers the highest degree of precision for further investigations.

AB  - It is difficult to use the traditional image segmentation method to segment the complex object whose boundary is blurred from the background. The active contour model, based on level set, is widely used in recent years and selected to segment this type of object in this paper. To increase the speed of segmentation, the fast active contour model without need to solve partial differential equation is used in this paper. This paper proposes a new way of thinking about designing the data-dependent speed function in the fast active model and gives the corresponding general speed function. The probability estimate theory and the conventional CV model are introduced into the data-dependent speed function, and then this paper proposes two novel fast models which can be called histogram-based fast model and CV-based fast model. The two models are studied both theoretically and experimentally. Finally a conclusion can be drawn that the histogram-based fast model is applied to segment the complex object from the background.

AB  - This is an ongoing research project combines System Dynamics (SD) and participatory modelling to identify variables forming the Russian Federation construction innovation system and to create an initial comprehensive conceptual model supported by stakeholder-based techniques. Quantification of this complex and dynamic construction innovation system is complicated as it includes a range of components such as information, resources, strategies, time and uncertainty. To map and conceptualize the system, system thinking and participatory techniques have been used. Methods employed academic and industry consultation and stakeholder engagement through participatory interviews. In this current paper we present the development of a conceptual model as a causal loop diagram to understand the causes, impacts and pathways leading to greater innovation performance in the Russian Federation construction industry. Moreover, the created model underpins the future development of an operationalized system dynamic model.

AB  - Multicore and manycore processors are now ubiquitous, but parallel programming remains as difficult as it was 30-40 years ago. In this talk, I will argue that these problems arise largely from the computation-centric abstractions that we currently use to think about parallelism. In their place, I will propose a novel data-centric foundation for parallel programming called the operator formulation in which algorithms are described in terms of unitary actions on data structures. This data-centric view of parallel algorithms shows that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiquitous even in complex, irregular graph applications such as mesh generation and partitioning algorithms, graph analytics, and machine learning applications. Binding time considerations provide a unification of parallelization techniques ranging from static parallelization to speculative parallelization. We have built a system called Galois, based on these ideas, for exploiting amorphous data-parallelism on multicores and GPUs. I will present experimental results from our group as well as from other groups that are using the Galois system.

AB  - Summary form only given. Business process models have gained significant importance due to their critical role for managing business processes.Still, process models display a wide range of quality problems. For example, literature reports on error rates between 10% and20% in industrial process model collections. Most research in the context of quality issues in process models puts a strongemphasis on the product or outcome of the process modeling act (i.e., the resulting process models), while the process followed for creating process models is only considered to a limited extent. The creation of process models involves the elicitation of requirements from the domain as well as the formalization of these requirements as process models. In this presentation the focus will be on the formalization of process models, which can be considered a process by itself-the process of processmodeling (PPM).In particular, this keynote will discuss how the PPM can be captured and analyzed. For this, it will present a specialized modeling environment, which logs all interactions of the process modeler with the modeling environment, thus, providing the infrastructure to investigate the PPM. The keynote will also shed light on the way how process models are created, present different behavioral patterns that can be observed, and discuss factors that influence the PPM, e.g., modeler-specific factors like domain knowledge or process modeling competence and task-specific factors. In addition, the keynote will provide an outline on how methods like eye movement analysis, think aloud, or the analysis of bio-feedback (e.g., heart rate variability)might enable even deeper insights into the PPM.

AB  - In recent times, Big data is modifying the style life of workplaces and thinking by improved performance in knowledge discovering and decision making ever-greater volumes of data are being produced data due to the network of sensors and communication technologies Heterogeneous data is a category of unstructured data with an unknown pace in several ways. Current data analysis techniques are inadequate to handle the huge volumes of data produced, this data difficult to manage, store, handle, interpret, analyze using traditional techniques. Deep learning (DL) is extremely popular among many data scientists and experts thanks to the high precision in speech recognition, image handling, and data analytics. DL has become much more important because it can be used for largescale heterogeneous data. DL has been applied efficiently in several fields and has exceeded most of the traditional techniques, DL algorithmic can study large unclassified data with the ability to select features. This study concentrates on the discussion of a variety of new algorithms that handle this data and DL models that provide greater accuracy for heterogeneous data.

AB  - The Intellectual style Inventory (ISI) is a psychometric assessment tool that identifies the preferential style in thinking and in perception for each person. The perception style is concerned with the way our minds usually focus attention regarding sensory inputs from the external environment as well as internal influences. The Integrated model of mind (IMM) is a psychological model that describes how encoding processes take place differently by various memory systems according to perception style preferences. The present work shows a cognitive model for perception in light of the ISI and IMM. It suggests a different encoding sequence performed by the different memory systems that correspond to each of the four perception styles identified by the ISI. The model was then converted into an applicable form; an electronic device (embedded system) that would help to identify the different types of memory systems and the image schema produced by any person according to his score on the ISI. The electronic device could be regarded as the mental finger print identifier for any person and could be perfectly used to manage memory and learning problems and to explore mental abilities and powers. It is made up of three main parts: the Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD AlphaNumeric 20×4 LM044L and Keypad 3×3 and programed using the C-language then simulated using Proteus Design Suite. The device is unique in its function, in the programing strategy and in its relation with the external environment.

When the hand model in computer application will be developed, It is necessary to think about approximate DoF for the real DoF of the joint of hand mechanism. Especially, the approximated DoF is evaluated from a view of dexterously manipulation of human hand. We have developed a hand model which is used for design tool of the industrial production. It is evaluated on the approximate DoF from a view of dexterously manipulation.

AB  - Summary form only given. Empirical Modelling (EM) is an approach to computing which includes, but is much broader than, traditional computer science. It occupies a territory where experience is more prominent than abstractions, where state has priority over pre-conceived behaviours and where the agencies behind state change (human or otherwise) are first identified. Extensive research, and teaching of this approach to final year computer science students, over many years under the leadership of Meurig Beynon at the University of Warwick has resulted in a large body of artefacts, environments and publications. They can be found at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em At the core of EM is an activity we call `making construals'. By a `construal of X' we mean `what we think of X' or `how we make sense of X'. As well as being a personal product of the maker it is at the same time an interactive computer artefact. The development method we adopt allows passage from the mere contemplation of a phenomenon or problem to the crafting of a program-like behaviour that is useful. We shall demonstrate this and explain the advantages of the approach, in at least some domains such as learning, when compared with existing programming paradigms. We have called the approach `human computing' in recognition that its `programs' - in both development and ways of use - have much more of the human qualities of flexibility, and multiple viewpoints, than is usual in a computing environment. It promotes closer collaboration between the human and computer. We shall report on the progress and challenges of the EU Project CONSTRUIT! which is half-way through its three-year duration. With its six European partners CONSTRUIT! seeks to promote the making of construals among teachers and students (at all levels) and to evaluate the effectiveness of this activity for learning across many subjects. See http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em/welcome We hope also to have a practical workshop on making contruals at KST2016 so we look forward to welcoming you to that and seeing what new construals you can help us make!

AB  - Technology has an important role in predicting a person's possible risk of chronic disease with the emergence of various kinds of research in the field of medical informatics, especially those related to the four chronic diseases that cause death in Indonesia, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. Delays in medical treatment due to not predicting the disease can lead to other serious complications in the future. Therefore, doctors must think and work harder to assess patients early with factors influencing chronic disease risk. Many studies have carried out disease prediction focused only on one to two disease predictions. Still, research related to risk prediction for four diseases simultaneously has not been carried out in health and medical services. This study makes a risk prediction model for patients suffering from one or four chronic diseases, which goes through several stages in data mining from medical record data and assessments. We used 29 variables from two combination data sources, calculated using the C4.5 algorithm to predict the patient's risk for the disease. Based on the accuracy test results, the chronic disease prediction model has an accuracy value of 84%.This shows that the resulting model has good decision-making and high accuracy. For further research, other parameters can be used to predict disease, such as dietary habits in a certain period.

AB  - With the radically increasing workload on web-based systems, new and innovative methodologies have been developed over years to enhance the performance of web caching. Among them are web cache replacement strategies. Although some classifications and categorizations of these strategies have been proposed, there is not yet a methodological and coherent framework for evaluating and comparing their performances. Current benchmarking tools focus on certain factors at the expense of others. In this paper, we survey the existing efforts and attempts; aiming at a unified evaluation framework that can be used to assess various cache replacement strategies in a wider spectrum of scenarios. Such framework can help developers and users to compare and select various replacement strategies to satisfy their needs and constraints. While discussing various issues related to a multitude of cache replacement strategies, we raise some points that we think are worth to consider in developing such a benchmarking tool.

AB  - Due to the widespread use of machine learning models in various third-party libraries in languages, such as the sklearn library, people can quickly learn how to simply use machine learning models to empower the projects. However, in many times, most people simply take the model and apply it, never thinking about its generalization ability in the projects where it belongs to, that is, whether the performance of the model will continue to be excellent in different application scenarios and completely different dataset structures. This work mainly tested the generalization ability of two models. By using a dataset for model training, a brand-new dataset is introduced into the trained model to test its generalization ability. If it is found that the generalization ability is not high, our model is optimized to improve its generalization ability as much as possible. After optimization, their generalization ability (represented by precision improvement here, as explained below) has significantly improved, from 38.56% to 100.00% and from 40.24% to 54.79% respectively.

AB  - Point cloud registration is a fundamental but important technique in robotics and computer vision, such as 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The classical methods used hand-craft features extracted from each point cloud to estimate the rigid transformation between point clouds with iterative closest points (ICP) or its variants. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in object detection, segmentation and registration, especially the well-known work, PointNet, changed how we think about the representation of point clouds. However, the local information is ignored in PointNet as many works pointed out. In this paper, we advise to use graph attention to aggregate local features and a kind of cross attention method for point cloud registration. Firstly, we use a mini-ConvNet to extract point-wise features for sampled points and their neighbors. Then graph attention is applied to aggregate the local information from neighbor points to center points. We consider that previous works which directly estimate the transformation using the features from two point clouds ignore some relationship between the point clouds. Instead, we propose to explore the relation with a kind of cross attention. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - Image classification is a popular and important area of image processing research in today's society. For machine learning, SVM is a very good classification model. CNN is a type of convolution neural network that has an unpredictable development and uses convolution calculations. It is one of the most well-known deep learning algorithms. This review thinks about and inspects exemplary AI and profound learning picture classification procedures involving SVM and CNN as specific illustrations. Using a large sample mnist dataset, this study found that CNN has an accuracy of 0.97 and SVM has an accuracy of 0.89; SVM has an accuracy of 0.85 and CNN has an accuracy of 0.82 when working with a small sample ImageNet dataset. Tests in this review show that for little example informational collections, standard ML has an improved arrangement impact than deep learning structure does.

AB  - With the development of model driven architecture(MDA), the number of models being used and produced is increasing. Comprehending and reusing models face a real challenge. Model query is put forward to solve these problems. Most people chose using OCL as the query language. However, OCL is a textual query language, it isn't powerful enough and always generates very complex query statements even for a simple query. We think that a graphical representation to specify queries on UML models could facilitate the software developers' comprehension on what a query pattern looks like, because of that it is easier to be understood and much more visual. In this paper, we propose a model query method which is queried by drawing examples of the UML model. This query method is based on the graphical representation we presented in this paper.

AB  - With the development of corpus linguistics and the improvement of computer performance, the effect of machine translation is getting better and better, and has been widely used. However, the existing automatic machine translation technology is far from being completely practical. As a feasible alternative to automatic machine translation technology, computer-aided translation technology has been greatly developed, and a feasible mode of computer-aided translation is interactive machine translation technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a Human-Computer Interaction Algorithm(HCIA) and designs an English machine translation system(MTS). Based on the research and analysis of the existing interactive machine translation technology, a human-computer interactive English machine translation algorithm model is proposed; The experimental test and analysis of the English MTS proposed in this paper show that the translation system designed in this paper reduces the translator’s thinking time and cognitive burden, does not need to spend too much time and energy on the correct translation recognition, and improves the translation efficiency.

AB  - Proposed at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the primary objective of artificial intelligence (AI) is to empower machines to think and solve problems akin to humans. Despite the emergence of various large-scale models in recent years, notable progress has been made in the realm of artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. However, machines still encounter challenges in autonomously learning and evolving like humans, and there remains a dearth of a robust mathematical foundation. This paper delves into the autonomous evolutionary process observed in humans and biological entities, asserting that “Needs are the fundamental driving force for organism evolution.” Additionally, the paper introduces corresponding representation algorithms and lays out mathematical theoretical foundations, thereby furnishing a theoretical explanation and a solid mathematical basis for understanding the autonomy of general intelligence models.

AB  - Multi-point forming (MPF) is a novel manufacturing technique for three-dimensional sheet metal. It employs two reconfigurable element groups to approximate the continuous upper and lower solid dies. With the technique, rapid fabrication of 3D sheet metal part is realized. In this paper, to investigate the feasibility of the multi-point forming for the tailor-welded blank (TWB), the explicit finite element model on TWB in MPF is established, then spherical surface TWB is selected as an example to simulate weld joint offset defect in the process of MPF, and finally method to suppress generation of defect is proposed. The simulation results show that in MPF for spherical surface part, weld joint removes to thick blank direction in zone of expanding and suspending, but to think blank in zone of blank holder; weld joint offset can be controlled effectively by adopting stepped blank holder and applying proper blank holder force.

AB  - Scalability is a fundamental problem in the development of computer games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). Players always demand more - more polygons, more physics particles, more interesting AI behavior, more monsters, more simultaneous players and interactions, and larger virtual worlds. Scalability has long been a focus of the database research community. However, the games community has done little to exploit database research. Most game developers think of databases as persistence solutions, designed to store and read game state. But the advantages of database systems go way beyond persistence. Database research has dealt with the beautiful question of efficiently processing declarative languages, and the resulting research questions have touched many areas of computer science. In this talk, I will show how the idea of declarative processing from databases can be applied to computer games and simulations. I will describe our journey from declarative to imperative scripting languages for computer games and simulations, introducing the state-effect pattern, a design pattern that enables developers to design games and simulations that can be programmed imperatively, but processed declaratively. I will then show how we can use database techniques to run scalable games and simulations cheaply in the cloud. I will then discuss how we can use ideas from optimistic concurrency control to scale interactions between players in MMOs, and I will describe how we can use these techniques to build elastic transaction processing infrastructure for the cloud.

AB  - We reason about a wide variety of continuous properties. Weight, level, pressure, heat, and temperature are examples of physical quantities. One-dimensional versions of position, force, acceleration, and velocity are also quantities. More abstractly, prices, quality, stability, difficulty, and simplicity are properties that we often think of as more or less continuous. For some quantities, like weight, instruments can measure reasonably accurate numerical values, calibrated upon some well-agreed-on cultural standard. For others, like depth of friendship, it is far from clear that any specific number can be easily measured, although we can often ascertain that we are closer to one person than another.

AB  - The main concept of the multilayer client-server queuing network model method is called the basic model. This basic model can be decomposed into two sub-models: client sub-model and server sub-model. These two sub-models can be solved using traditional queuing network analysis method such as MVA algorithm. It is proposed to predict performance of distributed software system based on existed queuing network analysis technique. The client sub-model calculates think time for server sub-model, and the server sub-model calculates waiting time for client sub-model. The overall model can be solved by iteration from one sub-model to the next sub-model. Then the basic model is extended to multiplayer client-server queuing network. This solution for multilayer client-server queuing network is called NLQN.

This article presents an online conversational agent based on the dialogic teaching strategy for learning Chinese at college level. Our experimental results showed that there were no significant differences in student learning performance between the dialogic teaching and narrative teaching. The system performance is challenging and might negatively affect the impact of the dialog-based teaching strategy on student learning. However, the findings illustrated that students felt that the system-delivered learning experience was interesting, which helped them to think independently.

AB  - Intelligence is a multifaceted concept that is generally defined as the ability of comprehending the environment, reasoning, planning, thinking, and learning. The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a well-known measure of cognitive abilities associated with intelligence. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that brain structure and function are related to IQ, which varies from person to person. In this study, we investigated the potential of neuronal effective (directional) connectivity, computed using regression Dynamic Causal Modeling (rDCM) applied to resting-state fMRI data from 100 unrelated subjects in the HCP database, as a source of information for IQ estimation. We used permutation t-test and step-wise wrapper methods to select 24 significant features derived from directional connectivity and applied machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 7-fold cross-validation to predict IQ. The results showed a reasonable IQ estimate, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of about 2 points and a prediction determination coefficient (R2) of about 70 percent. Our findings suggest that neuronal effective connectivity may provide valuable information for IQ estimation and support further investigation into its potential as a biomarker for intelligence.

First, researchers collect related information of stray dogs in Taipei city and use Net Logo to build the model for simulating the both natural and social phenomena (i.e. stray dogs problem). "Agents", including stray dogs, dog-catchers, and animal rescuers, are designed and adjusted on the basis of the collected actual information to make simulation results more meaningful for learning. The main contribution of this study is to allow learners to experience the complexity of the social phenomena and the interaction between associated factors so that they can realize the research process of social science. Although the established model of the simulated learning environment for stray dogs is not very precise, it doesn't affect the design and process of the learning activity. The future research will conduct educational experiments of the designed learning activity with integration of the simulated environment for stray dogs and evaluate learners' cognitive and affective changes before and after the experiments.

Firstly, the software module is converted into an abstract syntax tree, and later it is traversed to extract word sequence of the software module. Then, thinking of the word sequence as input, acts on the self-attention layer to perform semantic feature embedding of the software module. Finally, the Softmax neural network is used to predict the software defect. The experimental results show that the software defect prediction method based on Transformer model has better defect prediction effects in the three open source software, and it has an average increase of 3.2% than the optimal model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

By constructing the electric load data as a fuzzy extension set, the concepts of detectors and sample spaces reconstructed in primitive form are proposed. The biological thinking of the complement system is used to optimize the dependent function, and a comprehensive forecasting model is established to evaluate and combine multiple forecasting results, achieving the complementary advantages of various models. The experiments show that the proposed forecasting model effectively improves the adaptability and accuracy of the electric power system, and has broad prospects for application in the field of load forecasting.

Cloud providers have already used this approach for making PaaS and SaaS but not IaaS. With this implementation network administrator/ System Administrator may get ready to think for the deployment of their hypervisor based cloud to Container based cloud.

In contrast, the evaluation of 3D images and 3D data in digital pathology has not yet reached this level. One of the reasons for this is the resolution of digitized pathological sections, as well as the computing capacity required for the 3D reconstruction model created from them. In the course of our research, we designed and developed a solution that helps overcome difficulties arising from hardware resources with a technique called real-time network video streaming. Our solution enables users to collaboratively visualize 3D medical data even on low computing capacity devices. In the paper, we describe a part of this solution, which refers to the definition of the quality of service indicator. In our research, we implemented several solutions to define quality service in order to provide the best possible result to the user. In the paper, we describe and compare these solutions.

In particular, knowledge of trending topics provides us with information about what people are attracted to and what they think is noteworthy. Yet detecting trending topics from a set of texts is a difficult task, requiring detectors to learn trending patterns while simultaneously making predictions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model architecture for the challenging task of trend detection and forecasting. The model architecture aims to learn and attend to the trending values' patterns. Our preliminary results show that our model detects the trending topics with a high accuracy.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the Digital Social Networks (DSN) behavior, constructed from the network’s relationships, interactions, and expressions of users’ private states through collective subjectivity. For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities’ granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings’ communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.

AB  - Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an effective reasoning technology. The core idea of CBR is using past experience and expert knowledge to solve new problems. Operation planning of helicopter mainly relies on the experiences of the decision-maker, so CBR is an effective reasoning technology which can be used in the operation planning. Two key issues, evaluation method and case adaptation, are widely focused in CBR method. However, the existing CBR is not suitable for non-numeric optimization problem such as operation planning, because it belongs to small sample size problem. To solve this problem, the comprehensive evaluation based multi-CBR (CEB-mCBR) method is proposed in this paper, which can be used for operation planning of helicopter. According to the comprehensive evaluation theory, similar historical case set of the target case is established, and the historical operation plans are ranked. On this basis, the optimum initial plan for the target case is generated by the case screening CBR model. Then the solution element screening CBR model is further put forward to solve the issue of case adaptation. The CEB-mCBR method comprises multi-CBR (case screening CBR and solution element screening CBR) and combination evaluation method. It can integrate expert experience and human thinking better, especially when solution space is limited. Finally, through a case study analysis, the multi-CBR model can generate a feasible solution for the target case, and the solution elements can be adjusted according to the situation in the actual operation, which can improve the efficiency of operation planning while keeping the safety, economy and operating efficiency.

AB  - Project-based learning (PBL) is an active learning methodology focused on developing both soft and hard skills by solving real-world problems. In PBL, teachers act as facilitators while students take charge of their own learning. While the practice of this methodology in computing education has been growing in recent years, it still poses some challenges that need to be addressed. Integrating Scrum and Agile methodologies into PBL can be a valuable addition when teaching computing subjects to students. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a successful implementation of PBL with Scrum, applying Agile values and principles to teach Artificial Intelligence to undergraduate students. This study contributes to the limited research on Scrum in education, as well as helps bridge the research gap in AI teaching and learning. The case study involved 30 students from an undergraduate computing program, divided into five groups, who successfully developed five different Machine Learning (ML) models to tackle the challenging real-life problem of breast cancer prediction for the Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo. The findings of the study indicate that the students effectively utilized Scrum and Agile methodologies throughout the process and expressed satisfaction with the approach. Additionally, they developed problem-solving abilities, critical thinking and communication skills, teamwork capabilities, and gained experience in working with real-life situations and problems. The study also demonstrates that the proposed technique aligns with the foundations of the PBL approach in computing education discussed in previous literature. It serves as a valuable resource for future research on PBL implementation, by comparing similarities and differences with existing literature and discussing the strategies employed to address implementation challenges.

AB  - A cognition learning algorithm based on a deep belief network and inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented and examined in a humanoid robot. The psychology concepts were adopted from Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. The human brain comprises two systems, System 1 and System 2. Based on their characteristics, System 1 and System 2 handle different tasks during cerebration. In this study, Deep Belief Network (DBN) is trained to construct the function of System 1 for the rapid reaction. On the other hand, PSO is applied to build System 2 for the slow and complicated brain behavior. Through the cooperation of System 1 and System 2, the proposed cognition learning algorithm can apply the psychology theories to allow the humanoid robot for learning the suitable pitching postures autonomously. In the experiments conducted in this study, the robot was trained for only five selected points and was then asked to throw precisely to nine points. The proposed algorithm provided 100% accuracy in the robot pitching game. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was thus verified.

AB  - Different individual features of the learner data often work as essential indicators of learning and intervention needs. This work exploits the personas in the design thinking process as the theoretical basis to analyze and cluster learners’ learning behavior patterns as groups. To adapt to the learning practice, we develop data-driven personas by clustering learners’ features based on factual learning outcomes (i.e., knowledge gain, perceived learning experience, perceived social presence) based on unsupervised learning, a more accessible and objective intervention design strategy for e-reading practices. Using the Chi-square test, we quantitatively evaluate different clusters driven by various unsupervised learning methods on the multimodal SKEP dataset. Furthermore, for a more practical real-life application, we achieved automatic persona prediction based on the attention regulation behaviors of learners. The subject-independent evaluation results indicate the best classification accuracy of 70% for the four-level classification task, differentiating three personas of learners with needs and another without feedback needs. It also shows that time-based sampling on both independent and cumulative learner behaviors works as robust predictors of learner personas, achieving a stable accuracy range of 65%-70% throughout the e-reading with the SVM classifier. Our work inspires the design of a real-time feedback loop for e-learning based on conversational agents.

AB  - Nowadays, with the phenomenon of the world ageing getting serious, the demand for intelligent medical treatment becomes higher than past. A series of smart bracelets have been launched for the health of the elderly, which can detect the health condition of the elderly in real-time. When an abnormal phenomenon occurs and the rescue will be needed, it can transmit the signal to the medical platform of the hospital or the mobile phone of its guardian, and then the hospital would send an ambulance and relevant doctors to rescue the patient. This paper mainly studies the starting bracelet sensors to collect data to rescue behavior of the entire process, proposes a Petri net model of distributed resource allocation based on cloud medical system. Through the structural analysis of the model and the construction of the algorithm, the rationality and efficiency of the whole system model are verified, and the case study shows that the model can effectively find the optimal scheduling path and each part of the system can respond well.

AB  - In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.
