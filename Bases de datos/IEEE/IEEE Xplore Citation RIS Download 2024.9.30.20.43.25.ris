AB  - It is very difficult for students who do not have a business career or experience to understand business models or structures. In addition, business models from the student viewpoint remain largely within a model-based understanding, and students do not have practical opportunities to create an image of business uncertainty. Our goal is to provide an experimental learning environment beyond the level of the students' hypothetical thinking about uncertainty in business. We have developed a versatile participatory simulation environment as an active learning environment for the university classroom. We apply a multiagent-based approach to represent the uncertainty of the business environment. This paper introduces one of our active learning programs, the Croquette Factory Game, for understanding business interaction with uncertainty. We show that this program provides beneficial educational effects for students in understanding a business model with uncertainty.

AB  - What is it that differentiates man and puts him on the throne of the entire animal kingdom? Yes, it's the human brain, and not the human, which is the most valuable creation of God. But the brain, all its knowledge and power are destroyed after the death of man. Is it possible to model a brain and upload the contents of the real natural brain into it thereby propagating life even after death? Yes, indeed. Today, organ donation is giving a new lease of life to many ailing patients, however can brain be added to the list of organs that can be donated? Imagine the marvels that would be back into existence if we could replicate and restore the brains of geniuses like Sir Albert Einstein or Newton or even our great leaders of the past like Mahatma Gandhi. This paper presents a literature survey on the Blue Brain technology that promptly answers all these sparkling questions. Scientists today are in research to take artificial intelligence to a level beyond everything, to create a virtual brain that could think, react, make decisions and also keep everything in some form of memory to do everything that a normal human brain can. To achieve this, the main approach is to upload an actual brain in a virtual brain. So that even after death the person's conscience would be able to function exactly as a normal brain in the form of a machine. IBM along with scientists at BMI (Brain and Mind Institute) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Research University in Switzerland are simulating the brain's biological systems into a 3D model, which would recreate the electrochemical interactions that take place inside the brain. If this simulation results in a success, the modeling would extend to different parts of the brain and make it function with all the abilities of a natural brain, thereby eliminating the chances of any brain malfunctions such as psychiatric disorders like depression and autism, which are possible in the normal brain. IBM names this project as the 'Blue Brain' project.

AB  - For unable to establish geometrical relationship of coordinates, conventional methods of 3D shape recovery can not be adopted to a great number of precious historical images to recover the 3D shape of the objects and environments in the images. The new method of 3D shape recovery based on single frame historical image is proposed in this paper. The core idea of this research is that, according to the change of the shade of gray of each pixel, the tilt angle and slant angle of the surface vertical vector of each object's pixel in the image is analyzed, then the depth of each pixel is calculated in response to the tilt angle and slant angle. Simulating human being's vision system and the process of thinking of brain, this method makes the process of man's 3D comprehension of single image computerize to obtain 3D digitized data. These 3D digitized data can be used in the fields of the 3D recovery of historical relics and the identification of 3D portrait and stereo literal.

It has been originally developed as a component of an application that uses four dimension virtual reality modeling models of buildings (with time as 4th dimension showing the building process progression) for the interactive visualization of construction processes. We describe the theoretical and practical visualization issues solved in the implementation of an interactive real-time four-dimensional. We think that the four dimension virtual reality system can enhance the communication ability between managers and workers. We hope novice users become familiar with 4Record and to achieve a high ease of use of the whole interface. This paper will show the status of 4D- VR technology in China.

AB  - The statement “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” was printed in the Harvard Business Review about 10 years ago. Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) have become widespread and have been utilized in research and real world applications. We sometimes get consultations such as, “Please teach me about AI,” “I want to use deep learning in my business,” or “I want data mining to do a good job of analysis. What should researchers do? In response to these consultations, I will discuss three issues: 1) problems in which the data are available but cannot be used immediately (preprocessing issues), 2) problems in which the results are difficult to explain in an easy-to-understand manner (explainable AI), and 3) problems in which the purpose of data analysis has not been identified. First, I consider the topic “when we receive a consultation, there is a lot of data, but it is not ready for use.” This is a case in which the “data ready” stage identified by the researcher is different from the “data ready” stage identified by a general person. The second topic considers the following problem “the results presented by researchers are difficult for a general person to understand.” The researcher's explanations of the algorithm and its results are very difficult. A general person is unable to judge the data analysis result from the viewpoint of “is it useful for business?” The last topic is the most difficult; A general person vaguely thinks that “AI can do something,” but “something” does not allow researchers to identify issues. I will discuss the relationship between research and practical use and what can be done from an academic standpoint.

AB  - Online advertising has emerged as one of the major business models on the Internet. Publishers rely on the online revenue generated from online advertising to offer their free services. At the same time, intrusive ads such as pop-ups and animated layer ads are being perceived as annoying thing by an increasing number of Web users, because they distract the Web users from reading or navigating through the main content of web pages. It is definitely not a problem to place ads within Web pages as long as they do not become annoying. Thinking from the perspective of most users, online advertising should have a limit. It is necessary to model the intrusiveness of online advertising in order to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between user experiences and branding effectiveness. In this paper, an approach based on neural network is proposed to model the intrusiveness of online advertising. Comprehensive features of ads and hosting Web pages are exploited and effectively combined. Promising experimental results are obtained on Web pages collected from 500 Web sites.

The relationship between role and agent is relative independent, and role model is established before agent model. In this paper, we think role and agent is interdependent, agent is carrier of role, and role means what agent can do. When analysis and design agent model, should firstly have agent entity, then have role. We define role as a set of computation specification and function to realize relationship between two agents, establish a mapping between BDI model and role, and define an agent BDI model based on role (RA) using Pi calculus. Based on theory analysis, RA can keep balance among belief, desire and intention, and maintain model stable. In the end, we give an example of RA, example show RA can be conveniently established and used to construct agent goal solving organization.

AB  - Benin’s health system, like all health systems, is faced with the challenge of providing quality, safe and affordable health care. The problems of understaffing of health care personnel compared to the WHO recommendation on the one hand, and the problems of poor distribution of these health care personnel over the extent of the health care system on the other hand, lead us to think about a model of mobility and accessibility of health care in Benin. This work aims at setting up an intelligent algorithm of accessibility and mobility of health care and will allow any patient embarked at any point of the health system to be taken care of automatically by a doctor and a nurse. To achieve this, we have (i) studied the state of the art of healthcare accessibility and mobility, (ii) modeled the healthcare trajectory, (iii) developed an algorithm for the automatic assignment and management of a patient in a healthcare system and simulated it using operations research and graph tools. The work allowed to set up a dynamic algorithm of accessibility to health care and to answer the challenges of the health care systems.

AB  - This chapter provides specific details regarding the concerns of the founders of what is now the science of systems or systemics, in order to understand the stakes that still remain extremely relevant today. It proposes to revisit the key event system sciences, or systemics originated, in which the mathematician Norbert Wiener, professor at MIT, has been an emblematic actor. Cybernetics pertains to time‐related actions that are carried out in an unstable environment. In the 1990s–2000s, it became obvious that what the pioneers N. Wiener, J. von Neumann and A. Turing had imagined was beginning to turn into reality. Of the three, only N. Wiener perhaps knew about transistors. Today, we have all the technology to provide good systemics. The chapter provides a brief view of the chronology and the main changes in teaching systems science at MIT.

AB  - This paper documents the challenges in creating a computer-aided level design tool which incorporates computergenerated suggestions which appeal to the human user. Several steps are suggested in order to make the suggestions more appropriate to a specific user's overall style, current focus, and end-goals. Designer style is modeled via choice-based interactive evolution which adapts the impact of different dimensions of quality based on the designer's choice of certain suggestions over others. Modeling process is carried out similarly to style, but adapting to the current focus of the designer's actions. Goals are modeled by estimating the visual patterns of the designer's final artifact and changing the parameters of the algorithm to enforce such patterns on generated suggestions.

AB  - Fuzzy logic is a way of many-valued computing logic that deals with the truth values of the variables between 0 and 1, unlike the conventional Boolean logic. Membership functions are used to depict the fuzzy values of given variable. Though membership functions are determined through expert's opinion, however, the one estimated through heuristic algorithms is the preferable methods. Membership functions determined through statistical and knowledge engineering methods are usually application dependent and cannot be applied on different datasets. This research focuses on generating the parametric values of the triangular membership function using a novel method. Initially, the Fuzzy C-means algorithm is utilized to generate the parameters values of the Gaussian membership function. Using a set of equations, these values then estimate the parameters of the triangular membership function. The proposed method is applied to the quality of web services data. From the results it is verified that the new approach of generating triangular membership functions can be adopted.

AB  - Sustaining open innovation requires better understanding how collaborative efforts of contributors yield collective creativity. One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of collective creativity involves how collectives govern and coordinate the actions of individuals to maximize innovation output. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in open innovation communities. To this end, we examine the impact of governance mechanisms and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source socio-ecologies. Systems model of creativity and proxy metrics for measuring potential for collective creativity are utilized to conduct a simulation study of open source software socio-ecologies. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.

AB  - Digitalisation is the defining concept of the 21st century. Today, there is no area of life that is not digitised, not connected to the internet in some way, not connected to an online platform where the actor or solution is available. Digitalisation cannot be excluded from the education system either. Higher education has long taken advantage of the opportunities offered by digitisation, which greatly facilitates the lives of individuals involved in education. It is an effective and good solution for the educators, but it is also an equally effective and good solution for the learners. In this study, we want to assess the impact of digitalisation on the competitiveness of education and the perceptions of those involved in education, students and learners. We want to assess how the competitiveness of education as a key area can be improved by moving part of education from the physical space to the digital space and how this is received by those involved in education. In this paper, we will present our findings and the context that determines and judges the current state of the art of this issue based on the results of a Hungarian primary research.

AB  - ChatGPT is a novel AI tool that poses new questions for experts in education and introduces a need to change traditional instructional and grading systems. The first step towards a successful integration of ChatGPT into educational processes is to understand how students currently use it. In this paper we present our contribution towards this goal, a pilot study analyzing the results of a questionnaire filled out by 300 students of secondary and tertiary education. Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.

AB  - In the contemporary healthcare sector, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) carries substantial ramifications for practitioners of medicine. Emotional intelligence is becoming an increasingly significant asset for medical professionals, especially in light of the integration of AI technologies into clinical processes, encompassing the ability to perceive, comprehend, and regulate emotions. This research examines the various dynamics of EI within the framework of AI integration, illustrating its importance in numerous domains. An increasing number of medical practitioners are collaborating with AI-driven systems, which creates a nuanced relationship between the analytical prowess of AI and the emotive intelligence of humans; thus, a balance must be maintained. Additionally, this study examines the effects of EI on critical facets of medical education, interactions between practitioners and patients, and overall job satisfaction. This abstract advocates for a stance that underscores the criticality of bolstering EI talents in the face of technological advancements. A harmonious integration that acknowledges the potential conflicts and synergies between EI and AI to support both the cognitive and affective aspects of healthcare practice.

AB  - Analysis methods are essential for the vessel-impact resistant design of bridge structures, which have respect to reasonably determine the demand and capacity of bridge structures subjected to vessel impact loading. For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.

In this response, I argue that we should strive toward pluralism in understanding neural activity at both the emergent network and modular levels, on the bases that a purely emergent understanding would be incomplete, and that there are computational advantages to anatomically stable modularity.

AB  - In recent years, the emergence of cooperative robots has been facilitated by technological advances, including the development of safety devices. Although these robots are considerably more flexible than conventional industrial robots, when confronted with a new task, the human operator is often left to address related problems unaided. The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions. To facilitate this collaboration, this paper presents the development of a manipulator that enables two separate control centers the human brain and the robot's computational system to cooperate in solving complex, cognitive-motor tasks.

AB  - This article explores strategies for cultivating a paradigm shift in the engineering design of intelligent machines, moving from conventional anthropocentric priorities toward a more ecocentric orientation aligned with ecological ethics. Through a comprehensive literature review, historical patterns of anthropomorphism in intelligent systems are traced, revealing how human-centered considerations have persistently dominated machine design across eras. To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity. By reforming engineering education and culture from the ground up, the creation of intelligent machines can be realigned to enrich our shared environment rather than simply maximize human primacy. This paper offers a constructive roadmap to transform the promise of increasingly autonomous technologies in the $21^{\text {st }}$ century and beyond.

AB  - Individual differences in personality determine our preferences, traits and values, which should similarly hold for the way we express ourselves. With current advancements and transformations of technology and society, text-based communication has become ordinary and often even surpasses natural voice conversations- with distinct challenges and opportunities. In this exploratory work, we investigate the impact of personality on the tendency how players of a team-based collaborative alternate reality game express themselves affectively. We collected chat logs from eleven players over two weeks, labeled them according to their affective state, and assessed the connection between them and the five-factor personality domains and facets. After applying multi-linear regression, we found a series of reasonable correlations between (combinations of) personality variables and expressed affect-as increased confusion could be predicted by lower self-competence (C1), personal annoyance by vulnerability to stress (N6) and expressing anger occured more often in players that are prone to anxiety (N1), less humble and modest (A5), think less carefully before they act (C6) and have higher neuroticism (N). Expanding the data set, sample size and input modalities in subsequent work, we aim to confirm these findings and reveal even more interesting connections that could inform affective computing and games user research equally.

AB  - In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.

AB  - In the modern era the world comes nearer to every individual as an IT revolution where all the applications are computerized. As the level of security breaches and frauds of transaction increases, it requires highly secure identification and personal verification technologies. Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition. Experimental tests performed on the ORL and UMIST database achieves a recognition rate of 99 percent, with low computational cost without any pre-processing step.

AB  - Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.

AB  - People are all currently living in the world where data has changed how company think, act and plan. Data, if used correctly, might be able to become a company's sharpest weapon in fighting the competition with other companies. Inventory cost is one of the most burdening costs in the food and beverage industry with the items like degradable raw materials or fresh ingredients. If not managed correctly might become a waste causing loss to the company. Degraded ingredients also might lower the overall food quality which might result in unsatisfied customers. Managing inventory, however, is not as easy as it seems, especially with the traditional method. This paper focuses on development of accurate predictive model using computational intelligence for optimal inventory management with a case study of restaurant ingredient management. Several machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random tree, random forest, and model trees were utilized to build accurate predictive models from time series data of the restaurant inventory. With good prediction system using computational intelligence, the inventory cost and wasted ingredients can be significantly reduced, which this eventually maximizes the profit.

AB  - This research investigates the automatic translation of contracts to computer understandable rules trough Natural Language Processing. The most challenging aspect, which is studied throughout this paper, is to understand the meaning of the contract and express it into a structured format. This problem can be reduced to the Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction tasks, the latter handles the extraction of terms and conditions. These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning. This method is data-hungry, so the research also introduces data sets for these two tasks. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by introducing Law-Bert, a model based on BERT which is pre-trained on unlabelled contracts. The results obtained on Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction show that pre-training on contracts has a positive effect on performance for the downstream tasks.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described.

AB  - This paper presents a proposal and an experience report of an educational robotics course integrated to the process of resocialization of youngsters and teenagers in socio-educational measures. This proposal adopts a teaching approach oriented to the development of comprehension, analysis, logical reasoning, creativity and collaboration skills in order to develop in these young people real world problemsolving skills. The main challenge of this proposal is to favor the assimilation of the contents and the development of robotics practice outside the classroom, since, in accommodation, no course material is accessible from paper and pencil to robotics practice instruments. Thus, the main differential of this work is literally working the computational thinking in spaces of deprivation of liberty in order to develop ideas for problem solving tasks. The results of this developed experience point to excellent opportunities for resocialization and professional orientation of young people in socio-educational measures through the teaching of robotics.

AB  - Because of its ability to prepare students for the 21st century world of work, educational robotics (RE) has assumed a prominent role in education. Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions.

AB  - The objective of this study is to develop and empirically evaluate an educational model that enhances algorithmic thinking - a key element of computational literacy - through the application with the concept of so called semantic waves for advancing K-12 students' digital proficiency. The concept of a semantic wave refers to the process of moving between abstract, theoretical knowledge and concrete, practical examples to create deeper understanding and learning. Considering this, our proposed model in the field of algorithmic thinking is intended to support pre-service computer science teachers and educators in designing instructional processes that are easy to implement and facilitate swift planning and reflection for K-12 computer science education. Initial results indicate promising outcomes but also suggested areas for enhancement. This research furthermore delves into refining the model through the incorporation of notional machines and the computational action approach for improving the training of future computer science teachers and students for the challenges of digital transformation.

AB  - Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data repositories—performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration, reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories: analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s. Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing’s full potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and enforcing data privacy requirements.

AB  - Neuro-scientists are increasingly relying on parallel and distributed computing resources for analysis and visualization of their neuron simulations. Although science gateways have democratized relevant high performance/throughput resources, users require expert knowledge about programming and infrastructure configuration that is beyond the repertoire of most neuroscience programs. These factors become deterrents for the successful adoption and the ultimate diffusion (i.e., systemic spread) of science gateways in the neuroscience community. In this paper, we present a novel intuitionistic fuzzy logic based conversational recommender that can provide guidance to users when using science gateways for research and education workflows. The users interact with a context-aware chatbot that is embedded within custom web-portals to obtain simulation tools/resources to accomplish their goals. In order to ensure user goals are met, the chatbot profiles a user's cyberinfrastructure and neuroscience domain proficiency level using a `usability quadrant' approach. Simulation of user queries for an exemplary neuroscience use case demonstrates that our chatbot can provide step-by-step navigational support and generate distinct responses based on user proficiency.

AB  - We review an introductory course in embedded systems that characterizes embedded systems not by resource constraints, but rather by interactions with the physical world. This course teaches students the basics of models, analysis tools, and design for embedded systems. Traditional undergraduate courses in embedded systems focus on ad-hoc engineering practices and the use of existing modeling techniques, often omitting critical analysis and meta-modeling; we emphasize model-based design of embedded and cyber-physical systems. Students learn how to model the physical world with continuous time differential equations, and how to model computation using logic and discrete models such as state machines. Students evaluate these modeling techniques through the use of meta-modeling, illuminating the interplay of practical design with formal models of systems that incorporate both physical dynamics and computation. Students learn formal techniques to specify and verify desired behavior. A combination of structured labs and design projects solidifies these concepts when applied to the design of embedded and cyber-physical systems with real-time and concurrent behaviors.

AB  - This paper compares population-based and agent-based simulation of the dynamics of group Situation Awareness. The question how Situation Awareness spreads among a team of agents is important for numerous applications. In this paper, a population-based and an agent-based model of this process are proposed, and applied to a case study in aviation. A number of relevant simulations of the models are performed, to investigate whether the behaviour of the population-based model can approximate the pattern produced by the agent-based model. It was demonstrated that, especially for larger populations, the dynamics of the agent-based simulations can be approximated by population-based simulations, since both models demonstrate a similar pattern.

AB  - Control was from its very beginning an important concept in cybernetics. Later on, with the works of W. Ross Ashby, for example, biological concepts such as adaptation were interpreted in the light of cybernetic systems theory. Adaptation is the process by which a system is capable of regulating or controlling itself in order to adapt to changes of its inner and outer environment maintaining a homeostatic state. In earlier works we have developed a system metamodel that on the one hand refers to cybernetic concepts such as structure, operation, and system, and on the other to the philosophy of individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The result is the so-called allagmatic method that is capable of creating concrete models of systems such as artificial neural networks and cellular automata starting from abstract building blocks. In this paper, we add to our already existing method the cybernetic concepts of control and especially adaptation. In regard to the system metamodel, we rely again on philosophical theories, this time the philosophy of organism of Alfred N. Whitehead. We show how these new meta-theoretical concepts are described formally and how they are implemented in program code. We also show what role they play in simple experiments. We conclude that philosophical abstract concepts help to better understand the process of creating computer models and their control and adaptation. In the outlook we discuss how the allagmatic method needs to be extended in order to cover the field of complex systems and Norbert Wiener's ideas on control.

AB  - Container technology is being adopted to simplify workflow execution. In this paper, we investigate a workflow scheduling policy for container-based systems. A workflow, representing an application, consists of a set of tasks. Each task can be executed in a container within a virtual machine (VM), where the container packaging the function for the task should be loaded into the VM before task execution. To reduce the workflow execution time and the network bandwidth consumption, we propose a cost-efficient and latency-aware workflow scheduling algorithm that strategically loads the containers into VMs and executes the tasks on the VMs. The algorithm is based on “Stretch Out and Compact”, which can stretch out the tasks along the resources by critical path analysis and then find the inefficient slots within the computing resources and eventually compact the tasks into those slots. We introduce a concept of “virtual task” into the algorithm, where container loading is regarded as a virtual task that should be executed before the real task. The introduction of the virtual task can be more effective in finding the inefficient slots for the compaction, thus resulting in a more efficient workflow scheduling policy. Simulation results show that compared to the algorithms that fully or selectively load the dockers, the proposed algorithm can achieve less execution time while saving network bandwidth consumption for loading dockers.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a hierarchically iterate model of human conceptualization and cognition. Based on the theory of dual structure of cognition and related physiological evidence, we firstly propose the notion of concept space in human brain and a corresponding conceptualization model. Conceptualization is the process of forming concepts in our brain. The concept of cognition process is then defined to introduce our unified iterative cognition model. The hierarchy within the iterative cognition is the logic of human cognition. Some visual cognition examples are employed to investigate our cognition model. With our conceptualization and cognition model, the processes of auditory cognition, visual cognition and more over, language understanding could be explained under a unified theoretical framework. Separate papers describing specific usages of the framework will be published.

With the increase in efficiency and accuracy in prediction, classification, translation, and other traditional tasks, deep learning has also witnessed a surge in applications in various other sectors, one of them being music generation. This paper provides a brief introduction to the process of creating fresh new music from a collection of existing music as the sample, using deep learning architectures and training techniques. The creation of music using automated processes in the absence of human intelligence is not a fresh proposal and has been influencing human curiosity for a long time. Being an innovative and complex venture, it poses certain unorthodox challenges which are needed to be addressed. This paper focuses on the analysis of these challenges and explores the scope of this fascinating pursuit.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to historize the definition of computer science, particularly the characteristic ambiguity of the discipline toward the computer. This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.

AB  - Constrained by the finite depth of field (DOF) in optical cameras, imaging devices face difficulties in achieving complete sharpness across all objects or areas within the same scene. Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.

AB  - The computing in the network (COIN) paradigm is a promising solution that leverages unused network resources to perform tasks to meet computation-demanding applications, such as the metaverse. In this vein, we consider the partial computation offloading problem in the metaverse for multiple subtasks in a COIN environment to minimize energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy based on the changing computational resource status. The problem is NP-hard, and we transform it into two subproblems: the task-splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and the task-offloading problem (TOP) on the COIN side. We model the TSP as an ordinal potential game and propose a decentralized algorithm to obtain its Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we model the TOP as a Markov decision process and propose the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to solve for the optimal offloading policy. Unlike the conventional DDQN algorithm, where intelligent agents sample offloading decisions randomly within a certain probability, the COIN agent explores the NE of the TSP and the deep neural network. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed model approach allows the COIN agent to update its policies and make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance over time compared to the traditional baseline.

AB  - High complexity, meaning a model in which components interact in multiple ways and follow certain local rules, is a huge challenge for brain research. This paper presents a semantic vector-driven closed-loop model, namely THINKING-LOOP, for brain computing to improve the understanding and development of complex cognition. The proposed model is a three-layer fusion of data, information and knowledge with human intelligence, which exploits ontological knowledge modeling, rule-based reasoning and a human-computer interaction mechanism. The interaction and collaboration within the model depend on a pair of complementary schemes in a loop: the top-down scheme from the knowledge layer to the data layer that is used to search for stable cognitive patterns; and the bottom-up scheme from the data layer to the knowledge layer that is used to deeply analyze cognitive functions. As a key factor, human beings participate in the whole learning process of the model, which in turn assists human beings to make decisions. To verify the applicability of the present model in cognitive research, a series of fMRI experiments and analytic methods (e.g. statistical tests and network topology analysis) were conducted. The results show that the proposed model is able to take into account the characteristics of different types of brain patterns and cognitive functions, thereby achieving reasonable decision-making level.

A metaboloid is a processing unit in this architecture. A set of metaboloids is organized as a mesh-connected NORMA (No Remote Memory Access). However, the network may change because of metabolism. Therefore, metaboloids have to achieve homeostasis to manage running tasks. We propose two new algorithms in this paper, namely bubbling and drifting.

AB  - Food processing demands a considerable and continuous energy supply and the rise in the price of electricity in South Africa has put much pressure on the industry. This has forced a re-think and development of alternative energy efficiency technology. In South Africa's cold storage chain the entire refrigeration system is among the most energy-intensive areas, but also offers opportunity for short and long term saving. It also provides an opportunity for enhancement of sustainable development and cold chain management. This paper presents a combination of three efficient technologies in those areas: (1) Airflow pattern optimisation through a computer assisted simulation model in which overall energy efficiency of cooling facilities is dependent not only on the energy generation efficiency of the refrigeration system, but also utilisation efficiency of all cooling facilities. Optimal airflow pattern of a cold room would move heat effectively to a refrigeration system, hence increasing both energy efficiency and refrigeration distribution. (2) Variable speed drive (VSDs) technology on evaporator fans motors: VSDs reduce motor electricity consumption by 30-60%; other benefits include prolonging equipment life through motor speed adjustments according to load. (3) Minimising heat transmission load by heat conduction transfer - coloured and shaded external walls being a major factor. Such technologies saved energy, thus reducing cold chain facilities' demand. The system was also cost-efficient and, inter-alia, research detailed in this paper contributed towards alleviating South Africa's energy problems.

AB  - When you see or think about an object, your brain engages in a unique pattern of activity tied specifically to that object. That's how you know a cat is a cat, and not a dog or a house or a cloud. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other techniques, scientists are not only able to measure those activity patterns but are also deciphering what each pattern means. Essentially, they are beginning to read minds.

AB  - In the intelligent war, building a "computer brain" that can understand, think and cooperate with human is one of the development directions of the future command information system. The design concept of command information system architecture for human-computer fusion is proposed, which is the transfer of human intelligence to computer intelligence. The system composition of the core elements such as the game confrontation deduction environment is designed innovatively. The operational mechanisms before and during the war are elaborated. The command information system architecture reference model of human-computer fusion is formed. Finally, the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) is used to verify the top-level guidance of architecture design to the construction of human-computer fusion system through the typical application case of future operation.

AB  - With development of new technologies applied to biological experiments, more and more data are generated every day. To make predictions in biological systems, mathematical modeling plays a critical role. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) contribute to a large portion in mathematical modeling. In which parameters are inevitable. Noise is intrinsic in all experiments. Therefore, to think of parameters as statistical distributions is a realistic treatment. In this paper, we discuss in a 1st order ODE common in biological systems, how to calculate parameter distribution analytically according to the experimentally observed output assumed to be normal distribution. Conditions on when parameter can be correctly estimated are elucidated.

AB  - College counselors are an important part of the faculty of colleges and universities, the backbone of the ideological and political education of college students, and the main force in the work of college students. The 21st century we live in is a highly intelligent era. With the continuous emergence of intelligent computing as a typical technical means in contemporary network technology, the relationship between intelligent computing and people&#x0027;s life and work is getting closer and closer. However, college counselors are also facing many new problems and challenges. Therefore, how to improve the use of intelligent computing and better improve the competence of counselors has become a difficult problem for colleges and universities. Based on this, this article launched a research on the competency training ability of college counselors based on intelligent computing. This article uses behavioral incident interview method, literature analysis method and questionnaire survey method to carry out research. Through interviews with counselors, the competency characteristics of counselors are obtained, and the competency model of counselors is established. By consulting the literature, compiling questionnaires, designing a complete set of questionnaires in line with the research, and issuing questionnaires to 60&#x0025; of college counselors and teachers to obtain the most authentic data. Collect relevant data through questionnaire surveys, and then enter the collected data into the database for data analysis. By consulting related materials, using publicly published papers and works at home and abroad as references, we can obtain basic theoretical support and background materials, as well as the current status and development level of the research on the competence of counselors. The survey results show that counselors have a strong understanding of work. Generally, 45&#x0025; are familiar with them, 18&#x0025; are relatively familiar, and few are very familiar. 40&#x0025; of counselors think they have average competence. 44 &#x0025; of counselors voluntarily signed up and wanted to participate in training to improve themselves. 51&#x0025; of counselors believe that the best time for a training session is half a day. Regarding the training goals, only a small number of instructors have clear training goals. It can be seen that the research on the competence training ability of college counselors is of extremely high value.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive model of smart and collaborative last mile supply networks. Facing a multitude of challenges such as economic pressure, demographic change, and environmental demands, urban last mile supply networks are increasingly strained. Various solutions and strategies such as the integration of novel technologies and collaborative approaches are discussed in the literature and tested in case studies. The application of artificial intelligence for supply networks holds potential for future urban logistics optimization and is thus considered a relevant research avenue. A design science approach comprising system dynamics-based modeling is chosen due to last mile networks' inherent complexity. Systems thinking has proven to be useful in urban logistics and smart city research contexts as it enables researchers and practitioners to achieve a more holistic perspective. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of last mile network complexity as well as the underlying interdependencies.

With this contribution we aim to broaden the discourse on Green AI by investigating the current status of approaches to both environmental assessment and ecodesign of AI systems. We propose a life-cycle-based system thinking approach that accounts for the four key elements of these software-hardware-systems: model, data, server, and cloud. We conduct an exemplary estimation of the carbon footprint of relevant compute hardware and highlight the need to further investigate methods for Green AI and ways to facilitate wide-spread adoption of its principles. We envision that AI could be leveraged to mitigate its own environmental challenges, which we denote as ‘AI4greenAI’.

AB  - Influence maximization is to select k nodes from social networks to maximize the expected number of nodes activated by these selected nodes. Influence maximization problem plays a vital role in commercial marketing, news propagation, rumor control and public services. However, the existing algorithms for influence maximization usually tend to select one aspect from efficiency and accuracy as its main improving objective. This method of excessively pursuing one metric often leads to performing poorly in other metrics. Hence, we think that algorithms for influence maximization should make a suitable compromise between computation efficiency and result accuracy instead of excessively pursuing for one metric. Based on the above understanding, this paper proposes a new algorithm, called Global Selection Based on Local Influence (LGIM). The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is following: if a node can influence another node with large influence, the node also has large influence. Therefore, a two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes is proposed, which can reduce a large number of running time. Moreover, this paper also proposes a new objective function to estimate the influence spread of a node set. In summarize, the proposed algorithm utilizes the two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes to avoid unnecessary computation, and adopts a new objective function to replace time-consuming Monte-Carle simulations. Experimental results on six real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other four comparison algorithms when comprehensively considering computation efficiency and result accuracy.

First, the need for a VA-based software platform is justified to address the associated information overload and problem complexity. Later, a detailed background on the preceding use of VA in electrical systems as well in the automotive industry is provided. Based on the previous context and agile software implementation, specific guidelines for the development of a novel and functional VA-based computational tool are then provided to appropriately visualize, analyze and simulate in-car EDS.

AB  - Suicide has been a prominent cause of death worldwide, regardless of age, sex, geography, and so on, and predominantly suicide among teens, increased as the years have passed. Suicide ideation, suicide risk, suicide attempts have been studied extensively, and the most common cause has been identified as depression, followed by familial concerns, hereditary factors, stress, avoidance fear, and a variety of other variables. When visited by a doctor, most adolescents are unaware of their mental state and hence do not take action on their own or are not assisted by family or peer members to overcome their fear of social stigma or the treatment they must undergo. According to popular belief, early treatment and detection are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of suicide. As a result, the focus of this study is to illustrate some of the computational strategies utilized in deep learning and machine learning fields to detect kids at risk of suicide

Still computational functionality of all kinds of neural network implies guaranteed operating steady-state equilibrium is fast-reached first. On the other side of this spectrum Science of Neurophysiology yielded insights converging to Systems Biology approach Gayton-Hall (2006). It appeared, on the crossroad of these findings with Kolmogorov's representation superposition and Hilbert's Thirteen problem certain rater delicate subtle issues emerged Sprecher (2017). This paper gives one perception of these issues and suggested a revised view on the foundations of past developments, possibly by re-thinking own stability results for recurrent neural networks which possess time-varying delays.

AB  - We propose a vision for directing research and education in the field of information and communications technology (ICT). Our Smart and Sustainable World vision targets prosperity for the people and the planet through better awareness and control of both human-made and natural environments. The needs of society, individuals, and industries are fulfilled with intelligent systems that sense their environment, make proactive decisions on actions advancing their goals, and perform the actions on the environment. We emphasize artificial intelligence, feedback loops, human acceptance and control, intelligent use of basic resources, performance parameters, mission-oriented interdisciplinary research, and a holistic systems view complementing the conventional analytical reductive view as a research paradigm, especially for complex problems. To serve a broad audience, we explain these concepts and list the essential literature. We suggest planning research and education by specifying, in a step-wise manner, scenarios, performance criteria, system models, research problems, and education content, resulting in common goals and a coherent project portfolio as well as education curricula. Research and education produce feedback to support evolutionary development and encourage creativity in research. Finally, we propose concrete actions for realizing this approach.

In this paper we propose a biological inspired computational model for motor planning applied to virtual creatures. We present the results of a case study taken from Neurosciences to validate our model. Also, the flow of information in our model emulating the flow of information of the human brain is presented.

AB  - Transformer-based deep learning models have become a ubiquitous vehicle to drive a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) related tasks beyond their accuracy ceiling. However, these models also suffer from two pronounced challenges, that is, gigantic model size and prolonged turnaround time. To this end, we introduce E.T. that rE-thinks self-attention computation for Transformer models on GPUs with the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel self-attention architecture, which encompasses two tailored self-attention operators with corresponding sequence length-aware optimizations, and operation reordering optimizations. Second, we present an attention-aware pruning design which judiciously uses various pruning algorithms to reduce more computations hence achieves significantly shorter turnaround time. For the pruning algorithms, we not only revamp the existing pruning algorithms, but also tailor new ones for transformer models. Taken together, we evaluate E.T. across a variety of benchmarks for Transformer, BERTBASE and DistilBERT, where E.T. presents superior performance over the mainstream projects, including the popular Nvidia Enterprise solutions, i.e., TensorRT and FasterTransformer.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new method for the modeling of use case diagrams in the context of global software development. It is based on think-pair-square, a widely used cooperative method for active problem solving. The validity of the developed technology (i.e., the method and its supporting environment) has been assessed through two controlled experiments. In particular, the experiments have been conducted to compare the developed technology with a brainstorming session based on face-to-face interaction. The comparison has been performed with respect to the time needed to model use case diagrams and the quality of the produced models. The data analysis indicates a significant difference in favor of the brainstorming session for the time, with no significant impact on the requirements specification.

AB  - The collection of individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), is the target audience for the Think to Speak Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system. The slow communication rate of AACs accessible to the target audience renders them undesirable, exhausting to operate, and a barrier to social and economic inclusion. This research synergizes the use of Electroencephalography (EEG) and high-sensitivity piezoelectric sensor readings with a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) to create a physically accessible AAC with performance comparable to 7.8 characters per minute communication rate. Since self-expression is inextricably linked with physical, mental, and emotional health, this research is of great significance to the estimated one percent of the global population with complex communication needs.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have achieved a great success in natural language processing, and have a significant potential for multi-modal applications. Despite the surprising zero-shot or few-shot ability, it is also required to effectively fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CaptionT5, a video captioning model that fine-tunes T5 towards understanding videos and generating descriptive captions. To generate a more corespondent caption, CaptionT5 introduces thought-augmented fine-tuning for video captioning, in which a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on thought-augmented video inputs. This resembles the process that human see a video, think of visual concepts such as objects and actions, and then tell a correct and natural sentence based on the thoughts. To automatically generate thoughts, we propose (1) CLIP-guided thought sampling that samples thoughts based on the similarity in an image-text multimodal embedding space by leveraging CLIP. We also propose (2) CLIP-guided caption ranking during decoding for further performance gains. Through experimentation on VATEX, MSRVTT, and YC2 datasets, we empirically demonstrate that CaptionT5 performs competitively against prior-art video captioning approaches without using encoders specialized for video data. Further experiments show that CaptionT5 is especially effective under small number of sampled video frames.

AB  - Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person per-spective. However, the capability of VLMs to “think” from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from ego-centric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.

AB  - An improved think-globally-act-locally (ITGAL) method is proposed in this paper for the computation of a liveness enforcing/deadlock prevention supervisor containing of a set control places (CPs) for a Petri net (PN) model of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) suffering from deadlocks. The proposed method is especially suitable for generalized PN classes containing weighted arcs such as S4R and S4PR. It leads to optimal or near-optimal liveness-enforcing supervisors without solving intractable integer linear programming problems. By using a recently proposed optimality test for CPs, the proposed ITGAL method provides improved behavioral permissiveness and/or reduced structural complexity of the CPs. The applicability of the proposed method is shown by means of a number of typical FMS examples.

AB  - This chapter describes how the science of dynamics was created. It considers the study of electromagnetism, and focuses on the fluid dynamics. The chapter then focuses on many creative thinkers who formulated scientific models that described the behavior of the real world. Astronomy has been one of the most persistent activities in science. Galileo Galilei's greatest contribution was to combine experimental methods with creative thinking and mathematical analysis. Isaac Newton extended the work of Galileo to replace Kepler's empirical model of the solar system by mathematical equations. In 1864 Clerk Maxwell used an equation to show that an electromagnetic wave would be propagated through space at the speed of light. The chapter considers the efforts to create a mathematical model of aerodynamics.

AB  - The importance of feedback on students' learning activities, so as to facilitate high learning effectiveness, has been shown before. However, the effectiveness of feedback on students' learning activities, when students learn engineering processes based on computer based simulations, is much less well known. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of “correcting feedback” (i.e. the feedback indicates only students' mistakes) and “reflective feedback” (i.e. the feedback includes a hint to encourage the student to re-think a specific answer) on learning effectiveness of engineering students, when using computer based simulation in order to enhance the learning of engineering processes. The impact of “reflective feedback” is analyzed by carrying out semi-quasi experiments using experimental and control groups of students. It is found that “reflective feedback” does not result in higher learning effectiveness and that the students of this study prefer to correct their mistakes by focusing on “correcting feedback” and previously learned content, while using a “trial and error mentality”. The results provide evidence, first, about the impact of students' learning background when using teaching simulators, and, secondly, that simulators showing both, “correcting feedback” and “reflective feedback”, may reduce the stimulating effect of “reflective feedback” because of the presence of “correcting feedback”. Consideration of these findings will contribute to further improvement of process teaching simulators. This study is part of an ongoing research effort related to computer simulation based learning in engineering education.

AB  - A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.

AB  - Spiking neural networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically inspired learning principles than those in standard artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system’s intelligent nature.

AB  - As the world increasingly becomes characterized by the provision of services to customers, service research faces many challenges and needs a new vision. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services. Although research and experiential findings on services in many disciplines have achieved impressive results, systematic research on modern services systems is rarely considered. Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME. Providing basic definitions of services and services systems, this paper elaborates on the research objects and methodologies of SSME from systems perspective, and proposes that systems theory can be applied as the foundations of services engineering. This paper further sheds light on systemic issues in services science and engineering, services operations, and services systems management. It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level. Finally, some potential prospects in SSME research are presented to meet research demands and practical challenges.

AB  - The Creative Computing Challenge (CCC) project (2014-2018) is funded by the National Science Foundation and is designed to broaden participation in computing by providing professional development (PD) for high school teachers at Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the state of New Hampshire. Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.

AB  - School graduates of technology profiles classes are often seen as the most prepared potential applicants for engineering universities. Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies. The outcome may be useful for early schoolchildren involvement in innovative engineering initiatives through participation in research projects and STEM Olympiads including multi-language educational events.

AB  - This article presents a systematic numerical investigation of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor based on photonic crystal fiber (PCF). The proposed design is modeled and simulated using the full-vectorial finite-element (FV-FEM) technique and sensing characteristics, such as confinement loss (CL) behaviors, phase matching, and sensitivity, which are investigated and presented. The plasmonic layer is made up of TiO2 and gold for improved sensitivity. The reported sensor exhibits an amplitude sensitivity of −374.062 RIU−1 and a wavelength sensitivity of 2000 nm/RIU for the refractive index (RI) sensing range of (1.39–1.44), according to the loss spectrum shift. The reported hoop-cut PCF-based SPR (HPCF-SPR) sensor is suitable for biosensing and chemical sensing applications because of its broad range (1.39–1.44) of analyte detection.

AB  - This manuscript presents a ring-core Bragg Fiber (RC-BF) for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes propagation and supercontinuum generation. The proposed RC-BF is composed of alternating layers of soft glasses SF57 and LLF1 to render high nonlinearity to the fiber. Mode analysis using full-vectorial finite element method resulted in obtaining HE/EH modes to support vector modes as well as orbital angular momentum modes. The optimized fiber supports 22 OAM modes and exhibits a zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW). The small effective area of Fiber 3 aided in achieving the highest nonlinearity,  $\gamma $  = 91.51  $\text{W}^{-1}$ km $^{-1}$ . A near-infrared supercontinuum is generated with a 35 dB flatness over a bandwidth of  $\sim $ 1087 - 2024 nm in a 20 cm long RC-BF using a chirp-free hyperbolic secant pulse of width 200 fs and peak power of 5 kW.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment, situated in a highly immersive CAVE. A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.

AB  - The massive amount of misinformation spreading on the internet on a daily basis has enormous negative impacts on societies. Therefore, we need systems to help fact-checkers to combat misinformation and to raise public awareness of this important problem. In this article, we propose a hybrid model which combines bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model with various features to prioritize claims based on their check-worthiness. Features we use include domain-specific controversial topics (CT), word embeddings (WE), part-of-speech (POS) tags, and others. In addition, we explore various ways of increasing labeled data size to effectively train the models, such as increasing positive (IncPos) samples, active learning (AL), and utilizing labeled data in other languages. In our extensive experiments, we show that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models in test collections of Conference and Labs of Evaluation Forum (CLEF) CheckThat! Lab (CTL) 2018 and 2019. In addition, when positive samples are increased in the training set, our model achieves the best mean average precision (MAP) score reported so far for the test collection of CTL 2020. Furthermore, we show that cross-lingual training is effective for prioritizing Arabic and Turkish claims, but not for English.

AB  - Temporal sentence grounding aims to ground a query sentence into a specific segment of the video. Previous methods follow the common equally-spaced frame selection mechanism for appearance and motion modeling, which fails to consider redundant and distracting visual information. There is also no guarantee that all meaningful frames can be obtained. Moreover, this task needs to detect the location clues precisely from both spatial and temporal dimensions, but the relationship between spatial-temporal semantic information and query sentence is still unexplored in existing methods. Inspired by human thinking patterns, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Spatial-Temporal Relationship Inference (CFSTRI) network to progressively localize fine-grained activity segments. Firstly, we present a coarse-grained crucial frame selection module, where the query-guided local difference context modeling from adjacent frames helps discriminate all the coarse boundary locations relevant to the sentence semantics, and the soft assignment vector of locally aggregated descriptors are employed to enhance the representation of selected frames. Then, we develop a fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching module to refine the coarse boundaries, which disentangles the spatial and temporal semantic information from query sentence to guide the excavation of visual grounding clues of corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, we devise a gated graph convolution network to incorporate the spatial-temporal semantic information by leveraging a gate operation to highlight frames referred to by the query sentence from spatial and temporal dimensions, and propagate fused information on the graph. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CFSTRI significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In this article a didactic approach is introduced which seeks to integrate the progress made in the context of Block-Based Programming and other didactic approaches developed in the area of computer teaching. The prospects developed in the area of Project Based Learning Approach, Collaborative Learning and Embodied Programming are taken into account. Surrogate Embodiment, in the Embodied Programming context, is a kind of interaction where the movements performed by a person on a stage are directed by students. Furthermore, it is used as a structuring resource in the teaching process, the development of computational devices, paying special attention to skills development in the area of Computational Thinking. This paper presents a Video Game Development Workshop based on this approach with first year students from a state technical school. The experience has shown satisfactory results in connection to the acquisition of concepts and fundamental practices in the area of Algorithms and Programming.

AB  - A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills.

AB  - The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the l0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment.

AB  - Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples.
