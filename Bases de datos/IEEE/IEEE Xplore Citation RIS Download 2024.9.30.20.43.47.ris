AB  - The current technological scenario presents different mobile devices, which support wireless communication at an increasingly low cost. This all makes it possible to build systems thought to be impossible. The utilization of computational and natural elements, and the mixing of virtual and real elements, set up a complex relationship between elements. A good organization of these relations would enable the construction of complex systems that would bring countless benefits to users. This work presents an architecture to build hyper-environments, term proposed in this paper to define the interconnection between smart environments (which involve different elements, technological or not, real and/or virtual).The proposed architecture presents a taxonomy and a set of concepts for the organization of the hyper-environmental elements. It also offers directions to implement a middleware for building such systems. To validate the work, a hyper environment will be built using a middleware implemented based on the proposed architecture.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of joint support recovery in Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) models. We show that by exploiting correlation priors, one can boost the performance and computational cost of unrolled data-driven techniques for joint support recovery. We propose a novel unrolling of the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for correlation-aware support recovery, which preserves the special "Khatri-Rao" structure that underlies the model. The proposed network, termed as "KR-LISTA", provides a parameter-efficient unrolling which enables training with limited data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of KR-LISTA at test time for different values of SNR, and support sizes which were not provided to the network during training. In addition, KR-LISTA is also seen to be effective even in presence of model uncertainties. 1

AB  - Advancements in technology and computational power have significantly diversified the field of medical sciences, especially in diagnosing human cardiac disorders, which is currently one of the most severe cardiac illnesses that drastically shortens human lives. Early detection of heart failure is critical to prevent it and improve patients' survival rates. However, traditional manual methods are subject to inter examiner variability and bias, making them unreliable in diagnosing cardiac diseases. The study conducted aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms in accurately identifying and classifying individuals with heart disease and those who are healthy. For this purpose, a heart disease dataset was utilized to assess the predictive capabilities of the machine learning models. The study employs nine classifiers, including Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Regression (Li-R), Logistic Regression (Lo-R), and Naive Bayes (NB), before and after hyper parameter tuning. This research work also assessed various metrics, such as classification accuracy, F-measure, sensitivity, and specificity. By conducting specific preprocessing, dataset standardization, and hyper parameter tuning, it is observed that data normalization and hyper parameter adjustment of the machine learning classifiers significantly improved their performance in predicting heart disease.

AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted in a New Zealand secondary school to investigate the immediate and longer-term challenges and opportunities of a technology-supported learning initiative. A ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) initiative called for a stronger connect with digital technology in formal educational settings in 2012. This was indeed much ahead of its time, as now evident from worldwide move towards digital education in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tracked transformations within learning and teaching for over five years. At the inception of the idea, there was much resistance from parents and other stakeholders; however, the BYOD initiative ultimately showcased a very successful example of technology-supported teaching and learning initiative for other New Zealand schools. Our investigation primarily focused on one of the critical indicators for the success of such an initiative, the digital divide. The digital divide is particularly important because of the level of attention and dialogue this BYOD topic gathered across New Zealand. Initial discourses (over newspapers, radio and television) suggested that this initiative would be damaging in view of existing digital divides across societies and the overall public opinion outweighed the potential positives from such an initiative. As part of our five-year study, we investigated some of the key concerns around the digital divide issue in the context of such a technology-supported learning initiative. One of the key enablers of this study was integration of two frameworks, to enable the cross-examination of relationships between various sources of social cognitive abilities related to an individual’s information literacy, motivational and behavioral aspects. That is, how skill development, knowledge acquisition, and changes in personal and behavioral aspects impact self-efficacy levels as a consequence of BYOD strategies. The resulting framework is especially relevant in post-COVID-19 times, since technology-driven remote education delivery formats are now being touted as the new norm. Our framework will therefore provide much value to policy-makers in establishing inclusive educational policies.

There is a looming global workforce shortage in the computational science and high-tech space, primarily due to a disconnect between population demographics and the demographics of those educated to fill these jobs. The visualization community is uniquely positioned to bring a fresh approach to making diversity and inclusion fundamental tenets that are necessary rather than desirable.

Instead of give a bunch of equations and a calculator to the students, as it is usual in technical courses, we offer them the Octave, which is a numerical computational tool, and the mathematical concepts involved, in order to them find the solution of applied problems. Despite the deficiencies the students in technical courses have in their formation, we could notice that their vision regarding mathematics has changed after discover that there is more than calculators to help them finding the solution. The approach was initially applied with a group of 25 mature students, which passed by a flawed basic educational system and stayed away from school for a long time.

AB  - Group Counseling Optimizer (GCO) is a recently proposed population-based metaheuristics that simulates the ability of human beings to solve problems through counseling within a group. It is motivated by the fact that the human thinking ability is often predicted to be the most rational. This research article examines the performance of GCO on the benchmark test suite designed for the CEC 2014 Competition for Computational Expensive Optimization. Experimental results on 24 black-box optimization problems (8 test problems with 10, 20 and 30 dimensions) have been tabulated along with the algorithm complexity metrics. Additionally we investigate the parametric behavior of GCO based on these test instances.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe chronic mental disorder, which affects the behavior, the perception and the thinking of the patient. The purpose of this research is to develop a predictive system to preemptively diagnose Schizophrenia Disease using computational intelligence-based techniques. The system will show the possibilities of getting the disease at an early stage, which will improve the health state of the patients. This will be done using machine learning techniques. The used dataset has 86 records, which was obtained from the Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP) 2014 Schizophrenia Classification Kaggle Challenge. The used techniques in this paper are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayesian (NB). The highest accuracy was 90.6977% reached by using SVM, RF, and NB techniques while ANN technique reached 88.3721% accuracy. The obtained accuracies are reached by using 204 features. Therefore, we conclude that using SVM, RF, and NB techniques are better in this particular problem.

AB  - The emerging information technology and the rising computational thinking make it possible to establish new theoretical methods and engineering practices for planning, scheduling, control and decision-making of complex logistics systems. Consequently, the complex logistics systems oriented neural-physical fusion computation (CLSO-NPFC) is proposed initially to discuss and explore the decision issues of complex logistics systems at all the strategic, tactical and operational levels. By CLSO-NPFC, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computing mechanization, automation and intelligence are constructed uniformly and tentatively, and the typical deep learning model neural computing architecture (DLM-NCA) in CLSO-NPFC is designed for the prediction of calling liner handling volume that is measured by container units rather than twenty-feet equivalent unit. A typical regional container terminal along the coast of China is selected to implement, execute and evaluate the DLM-NCA, and the DLM-NCA shows the agile, efficient and robust performance for forecasting with the low and stable computation consumption. It demonstrates the feasibility, credibility and practicality of the abstract principles, design paradigms and computing architecture in CLSO-NPFC preliminarily.

The ways and processes of human thinking developed by Psychologists and welcomed by computational experts produce the science of Artificial Intelligence. This continues with the development of cognitive science that encourages the development of Artificial Intelligence to Cognitive Thinking Intelligence, a new pathway to the science of Artificial Intelligence that can emulate human cognitive abilities even if not 100%. Emulation of human cognitive abilities is developed based on the modeling of system interaction with the environment and information fusion, which can be used to conduct Inferencing, so when this occurs repeatedly it will produce knowledge that grows. This process is called Knowledge Growing System which is Brain Inspired Cognitive Artificial Intelligence and can be used for information extraction and when applied to instrumentation system will realize Intelligent Instrumentation System.

AB  - More and more K-12 schools are paying attention to the training of Computational Thinking. A considerable amount of K-12 use blocked-based visual programming platforms such as Scratch, App Inventor, Alice and etc. MIT App Inventor is one of the more popular mobile application visualization programming platforms. Visual programming is based on the 'You see what you get' doctrine. Its simplicity and ease of use coheres with K-12 teaching principles and allows students to access to computational thinking without the burden of learning Coding grammar. Recently App Inventor is gaining momentum and traction in China at a very high speed and is expected to grow even faster in the future. Teachers using App Inventor for teaching face the problem of having to go through a very high number of App Inventor apps without any way to catalogue them. The 2017 Google App Inventor Competition alone received over 1300 entries. This article aims to devise an automated scoring method based on TF-IDF and clustering to help teachers evaluate App Inventor apps, thus greatly reducing their workload. Evaluating the method gives us an 75.42% with space for further improvement in the future.

AB  - To maintain competitiveness as a nation, the United States must broaden participation in computing education and career pathways. Integrating computational thinking and computer science in K-12 classrooms is becoming increasingly essential to the development of a responsible and innovative workforce. Further, with increased recognition of the need for computing competency, workforce development programs that target the emerging workforce that may not be on a college pathway and those citizens who want to retool for the digital economy are also essential. This study examines work by researchers and practitioners in Mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. The state of Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of STEM employment. With half of the public school children identified as African American, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing. Assessments from a K-12 teacher professional development programs will be discussed, in addition to outcomes from one year of a workforce development program.

AB  - We can think of the set of propositions describing the outcome of measurements of physical systems as a set of propositions of the form “Measurand X had (didn't have) value V at time t”. In classical physics, this system of propositions has a Boolean logic (BL). In quantum mechanics, this system is isomorphic to the algebra, C(H), of closed linear subspaces of (equivalently, the system of linear operators on (observables in)) in a Hilbert space and is isomorphic to an ortholattice (OL). A consequence of the existence of non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics is that QL does not satisfy the BL distribution law. Quantum logicians have thus paid much attention to "quasi"- distributive theorems, one of the better known of which is the Marsden-Herman theorem (MHT). Informally, the MHT states that if there is a four-element cyclic chain of commuting elements in an orthomodular lattice, the distributive law holds for those elements. Here I provide a Mathematica-based automated deduction of the MHT.

The MFC provides several important opportunities for the red meat sector, including enhanced robustness, scalability and flexibility. Moreover, it is mindful of the need for small-medium meat processors requiring access to automation, which has proven uneconomical until now. The industry has renewed interest in such automation initiatives, particularly considering its need to improve resilience in the face of future global pandemics. The paper describes the progress of the MFC, as well as a rudimentary framework for realising the implementation. Finally, the paper discusses some of the major hurdles faced in the future.

This architecture creates two different actors: (i) conceptual designers and Database Administrators (DBA). The first actor collects user requirements, chooses the relevant diagrams for designing the conceptual model (or the logical model). The DBA ensures the performance, the maintenance and the tuning of the final application. Most of the tasks performed by these two actors are complex and time consuming for a majority of companies. Recently, some academic and industry research efforts are moving towards truly zero-administration of DW by proposing tools (advisors) substituting some tasks of DBA. One of the functionalities of these tools is to propose recommendations in choosing optimization structures such as indexing, materialized views, etc. They do not guarantee robust solutions. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary economical model for DB /DW application. Instead of substituting the DBA by advisors, we propose to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers like selecting optimization structures. First, we propose to connect user requirements to the conceptual model of the target application. Secondly, based on the analysis of requirements, SQL queries are identified and then used to select optimization structures. Finally, a feasibility of our approach is tested through the selection of bitmap join indexes based on user requirements.

AB  - Building on the success of the first North-South cross-continental collaborative educational robotics mission held in November 2015 [1], this paper presents a practical model for scaling the event up into a program for developing countries, particularly those of Africa, where the first edition took place. Past participants in Remote Rescue Thymio II (R2T2) missions, students and educators alike, have shared qualitative observations about its positive educational impact, notably in the areas of Collaboration, Communication, Critical thinking, Creative problem solving, Computational thinking, and Cross-cultural exchange. The proposed framework for delivering R2T2 missions has been adapted to Africa, being specifically designed to tackle the critical challenges of internet connectivity, teacher training and program costs. In so doing, it strives to pave the way for collaboration with partners in African educational ecosystems and North-South funding bodies that share the vision of making collaborative STEM education more accessible and attractive to teachers and schoolchildren around the world.

AB  - Recent research has shed light on integrating cutting-edge technologies in various organisations to support daily operations in the digital age. However, this implementation has resulted in undesirable consequences, notably contributing to global warming and climate change, primarily due to unchecked carbon emissions. Higher Educational Institutions are expected to lead by example in reducing global carbon emissions. Despite some institutions’ efforts in this regard, multiple studies suggest that progress could be expedited through digital technology, leaving room for improvement. Numerous Higher Educational Institutions still need sustainable practices within their building infrastructure. Hence, this research project was developed to create an intelligent model for monitoring the carbon footprint of buildings within Higher Educational Institutions. The study focused on the Bandung Institute of Technology facilities, which encountered similar challenges stemming from various aspects contributing to the overall carbon footprint. This research effectively managed energy consumption by implementing design thinking, encompassing electricity and water usage, and reducing emissions. Furthermore, the application of this model provided valuable insights into both current and projected energy consumption and emission production. It also assessed the sustainability status of these buildings and enhanced the efficiency of information dissemination in energy reporting processes. This, in turn, facilitated the implementation of proactive measures for emission management not only at the Bandung Institute of Technology but also in other Higher Educational Institution buildings sharing similar characteristics.

AB  - Linguistic group decision making (LiGDM) aims at solving decision situations involving human decision makers (DMs) whose opinions are modeled by using linguistic information. To achieve agreed solutions that increase DMs' satisfaction toward the collective solution, linguistic consensus reaching processes (LiCRPs) have been developed. These LiCRPs aim at suggesting DMs to change their original opinions to increase the group consensus degree, computed by a certain consensus measure. In recent years, these LiCRPs have been a prolific research line, and consequently, numerous proposals have been introduced in the specialized literature. However, we have pointed out the nonexistence of objective metrics to compare these models and decide which one presents the best performance for each LiGDM problem. Therefore, this article aims at introducing a metric to evaluate the performance of LiCRPs that takes into account the resulting consensus degree and the cost of modifying DMs' initial opinions. Such a metric is based on a linguistic comprehensive minimum cost consensus (CMCC) model based on Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation information that models DMs' hesitancy and provides accurate Computing with Words processes. In addition, the linguistic CMCC optimization model is linearized to speed up the computational model and improve its accuracy.

AB  - Due to the rapid development of network technology, the structure of computer network is increasingly complicated.The traditional random network model is difficult to characterize the topology of current computer network.Complex network theory provides new view and thinking to study in this field. In this paper, we give a probabilistic model to examine the evolution of computer networks by random duplication processes of node degree as well as the preferential choice mechanisms. The model is solved exactly for large network. We demonstrate that both the degree distribution and the triangle distribution have stationary properties. When the size of the network tends to infinity,the degree distribution behaves as P(k) prop k-3 and the average clustering coefficient C is independent of the network size N.

AB  - The recognition of unlimited signatures is an ongoing challenge for computer vision systems. Traditionally, in paragraph text recognition, two separate models are used for character splitting and text character recognition. In this regard, this study proposes an integrated end-to-end framework and a new hybrid thinking approach to address the existing challenge. The prototype is specifically intended to handle a splitting picture per align iteratively, with three different modules. Initially, the encoder creates maps of features derived from the whole passage picture. Then, a concept module produces typically a mask with weights, which enables focused analysis of current text line features, especially implicit line splitting Finally, the decoder module is used for performing spectrum detection in each text line feature, ending with comprehensive detection of the entire paragraph offers a new solution.

AB  - Humanoid reasoning and computing are the crucial research objectives of computing thinking, so semantic understanding and explicit representation are the basis steps for computing thinking. However, at present, there is no mature and systematic theory and engineering technology to fully describe massive multi-dimensional semantic expressions of natural language. Then the semantic inheritance and overloading theory was proposed to describe the semantic superposition and synthesis processing of the input vocabularies in this paper. Taking the clause as the basic semantic unit, the semantics were integrated by the local semantics of the clause itself and the global semantics of the cross clauses. The semantic frameworks were represented by the core vocabulary sequence of the clause, and the unified semantic representation grammar of the semantic frameworks to explicitly describe the local semantics and global semantics was studied; From the perspective of big data engineering, according to the unified grammar, the semantic annotation was chose as the initial step, the semantic scene based on the pattern matching of semantic frameworks was divided, the implementation technologies of semantic inheritance and overloading theory between scenes on the base of the observed language representation phenomenon were put forward, and the core algorithms of machine humanoid resolving primary mathematics application problems were realized, the effectiveness of semantic inheritance and overloading theory was preliminarily verified. The advantage was that the implementation could make full use of the power of the cloud computing to do semantic annotation and semantic framework pattern matching in parallel, and explore the engineering way to achieve natural language semantic understanding and computing thinking.

AB  - With the advent of mainstream parallel computing, applications can obtain better performance only by scaling to platforms with larger numbers of cores. This is widely considered to be a very challenging problem due to the difficulty of parallel programming and the bottlenecks to efficient parallel execution. Inspired by how networking and storage systems have scaled to handle very large volumes of packet traffic and persistent data, we propose a new approach to the design of scalable, parallel computing platforms. For decades, computing platforms have gone to great lengths to ensure that every computation specified by applications is faithfully executed. While this design philosophy has remained largely unchanged, applications and the basic characteristics of their workloads have changed considerably. A wide range of existing and emerging computing workloads have an inherent forgiving nature. We therefore argue that adopting a best-effort service model for various software and hardware components of the computing platform stack can lead to drastic improvements in scalability. Applications are cognizant of the best-effort model, and separate their computations into those that may be executed on a best-effort basis and those that require the traditional execution guarantees. Best-effort computations may be exploited to simply reduce the computing workload, shape it to be more suitable for parallel execution, or execute it on unreliable hardware components. Guaranteed computations are realized either through an overlay software layer on top of the best-effort substrate, or through the use of application-specific strategies. We describe a system architecture for a best-effort computing platform, provide examples of parallel software and hardware that embody the best-effort model, and show that large improvements in performance and energy efficiency are possible through the adoption of this approach.

Conducting cloud computing in a spatiotemporal fashion will help use spatiotemporal principles, which exist in all physical and social sciences, to optimize cloud computing and science discoveries. This paper 1) introduces the latest advancement of distributed computing; 2) analyzes the impact cloud computing has on GIS science, application, and education; 3) illustrates how spatiotemporal principles exist and can be utilized to enable cloud computing and science discoveries; and 4) discusses research directions and agenda for GIScience professionals in the 21st centuries.

AB  - Historians of scientific thought and philosophy have emphasized during the Enlightenment a shift from chance-based medieval thought to probability-based modern thought. They have not, however, focused on the technology that makes the implementation of such thought possible. At the same time, historians of computing have emphasized the rise of mechanical calculators—predecessors of modern computers—in this same period, but only in reference to solving practical problems arising from increasingly complex societies. This paper will draw on the two different streams of historical thought to show how the rise of probability and statistics and the rise of mechanical calculating devices were inextricably linked in complex ways.

AB  - Designing robots is a multiphase process aimed at solving a multi-criteria optimization problem to find the best possible detailed design. Generative design (GD) aims to accelerate the design process compared to manual design, since GD allows exploring and exploiting the vast design space more efficiently. In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots.

AB  - Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.

In this study, we propose a “restorying” pedagogy which engaged high school youth in interrogating dominant narratives about computer science through collaborative, electronic textile quilt-making. In our social design experiment approach, we designed and implemented a workshop where 14 racially- and ethnically-diverse youth crafted and coded interactive quilt patches that were digitally “stitched” into a collaborative artifact, with each patch reimagining CS from youths' perspectives (particularly regarding what CS is, who can participate in CS, and how CS is done). By analyzing post-workshop interviews and participant artifacts, we observed that counterstorytelling through electronic quilting can act as accessible and authentic tools to support youth's political identity work, electronic counternarrative expression, and community building in computing education. In the discussion, we address how restorying can contribute towards developing self-authored identities and critical computational literacies among youth and educators, as well as political solidarity within CS learning environments.

AB  - The rapid growth of the manufacturing, automotive, robotics, and smart-grid industries will require engineers that posses attributes related to multidisciplinary formation and strong tools to design solutions to complex problems. The engineer's formation requires to include the development of multidisciplinary abilities into their programs and backing the theory with real-world practice. In this sense, specialized laboratories are necessary in order to carry out this kind of formation and training. However, the lack of specialized laboratories is one of the main obstacles preventing us from reaching this objective. The specialized laboratories require specialized installation, maintenance and cost management as well as a design that can accommodate a large number of students. In contrast, the virtual laboratories are one tool that can be used to deal with both issues which are the lack of specialized engineers and the absence of specialized laboratories. This work proposes a new design of a virtual laboratory in order to specialize engineers in several fields such as power electronics, electric machines, automatic control, and information and computational technologies. The laboratory proposed includes tools such as co-simulation, co-modeling, and co-design in order to face complex problems within the industry.

In academic discourse, conceptual frameworks provide us with the language and a lens to understand our research. They supply mental maps or visual organizers for ideas. And they orient our present and future selves: how to think, what to say, how to act, and how to make sense of whatever we encounter.

AB  - Recently, Japan (also world-wide countries) has become aged society, and a wide variety welfare device and system have been developed. But evaluation of welfare system and device are limited only stability, intensity and partial operability. Thus, evaluation of usefulness is insufficient. Evaluation of usefulness is necessity to consider about interaction of human and welfare device. In this paper, we measure load of sitting and standing movement to use EMG (Electromyogram) and 3D Motion Capture and set a goal to establish objective evaluation method. We think that establishing objective evaluation method is necessity to develop useful welfare device. We examined possibility of assessing load and fatigue from measuring brain activity to use NIRS (Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy). We think that measuring load and fatigue is very important for developing user-friendly welfare device. Idea of universal design is widespread in welfare device and system. Measuring require verification of all generations. However, we performed to measure younger subjects as a first step. We think that younger subjects were observed the significant difference, because they had enough physical function. Considering younger subjects as a benchmark is appropriate for creating evaluation method.

In fact, research is all about thinking of problems and their solutions. This thinking is a process of connecting things and ideas present all around you. If you cannot connect ideas then probably you are not connecting yourself to the relevant research. In this talk, the focus will be to guide the audience towards doing research from surroundings and especially look for interdisciplinary research themes that would connect the scientists and society and probably be more beneficial for all.

AB  - Since the new Curriculum Reform was carried off, there has been a lot of research on teaching mode of programming in high school. On the basis of the exploration of the potentials if designing a teaching mode with the Scratch Graphical Programming Language, this paper builds a situational teaching mode of programming in high school with Scratch. This teaching mode first design a programming learning situation which is familiar by students because of its close connection to the students' daily life with Scratch for student through the analysis of the common elements between the situation and the concept of programming. The n guide students learning in the situation, and transfer back to the traditional programming environmental after he understand the content of concept. This teaching mode can arouse the students' interests of learning; promote the students' learning transfer ability. Ultimately this teaching mode can help students better understand algorithm programming and established their Computational thinking. Both of them play a significant positive role in developing students' logical thinking ability and their ability in solving practical problem.

AB  - The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.

AB  - Although the research on digital gaming has recently shown that collaboration, problem solving and critical thinking are in evidence with K-12 students who design games; researchers still need to make the case that digital game design content meets rigorous new Common Core standards for Language Arts and mathematics. No class time will be devoted to game design unless proponents of digital gaming can develop and demonstrate this argument. This preliminary data focus on a feasibility implementation of an assessment designed to embed these standards. Three elementary level classroom teachers and their students used the process and demonstrated that (1) teachers can learn to design and use this process and (2) their students demonstrate elements of computational thinking that not only includes the Common Core standards but extends them.

AB  - Deep-learning based computer vision models have proved themselves to be ground-breaking approaches to human activity recognition (HAR). However, most existing works are dedicated to improve the prediction accuracy through either creating new model architectures, increasing model complexity, or refining model parameters by training on larger datasets. Here, we propose an alternative idea, differing from existing work, to increase model accuracy and also to shape model predictions to align with human understandings through automatically creating higher-level summarizing labels for similar groups of human activities. First, we argue the importance and feasibility of constructing a hierarchical labeling system for human activity recognition. Then, we utilize the predictions of a black box HAR model to identify similarities between different activities. Finally, we tailor hierarchical clustering methods to automatically generate hierarchical trees of activities and conduct experiments. In this system, the activity labels on the same level will have a designed magnitude of accuracy and reflect a specific amount of activity details. This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the details in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some sensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly prohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy is generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper levels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too detailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final prediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can reveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection strategies.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for the coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems using the matched-filter (MF) concept. We consider an OFDM symbol with N subcarriers so that the receiver takes N time samples of the received noisy CO-OFDM signal. Our idea is to first append these N received samples with (L - 1)N zeros at the end to get a sequence of LN time samples. By taking the discrete Fourier transform of these LN samples, we compute the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol at LN discrete frequency points. We think of this spectrum as being made up of L sets of N points each, each set consisting of the frequency points {2π/LN l, 2π/LN l + 2π/N , . . . , 2π/LN l + 2π(N -1)/N}, for each value of l, where l = 0, 1, . . . , L - 1. Each set of N points for one value of l can be considered as the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol corresponding to one hypothesized value 2π/LN l of the CFO. The receiver can now obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimate by determining the hypothesized value that best matches the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol received from the channel. In the case of data-aided (DA) ML estimation, we treat the OFDM symbol as a pilot symbol in which we know the data in all the subcarriers, and this pilot symbol is used as the reference signal for the MF. In the case of blind (BL) ML estimation, the data in all the subcarriers are unknown, and the receiver uses an OFDM symbol with no data modulation in all the subcarriers as the reference signal. After making the ML decision of the hypothesized value of the CFO, a fine search will be carried out to determine the actual value more accurately. It turns out only one step is necessary to locate the actual value of the CFO. The DA MF ML algorithm can achieve full-range (integral and fractional part) CFO estimation with high accuracy, while the BL MF ML algorithm has low computational complexity but focuses on the fractional CFO estimation only. We discuss the complexity and performance of this MF ML algorithm, and present simulation results to demonstrate the estimation error variance for 16-PSK/QAM modulations. The simulation results show that the estimation error variance of the DA MF ML algorithm can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the absence of the laser phase noise.

AB  - Physical space appeared with the birth of the earth. With the emergence of social space, thinking space, and cyberspace (STCs), things in physical space are continuously enriched. Consequently, the PhiNet, an abstracted network concept such as relationships between things, is becoming more complex. Physical space plays a fundamental role in promoting the connection and development with the other three spaces. We think that PhiNet of Things (PoT) is a unified description of pure physical space and the evolving physical space affected by STCs. While the Internet of Things (IoT) is described from a cyber view, in this article, the definition of PoT is put forward from a natural view. Besides, the evolution of PoT is identified by the time sequence in which the four spaces appeared. At each stage, research is carried out from two perspectives of things and PhiNet, and two specific examples are presented to illustrate the change process of things and the related PhiNet. In addition, two applications are listed to explain the usability of PoT in the current development stage. Finally, the article gives the possible future development direction of PoT. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the fundamental role of physical space in the continuous development through time sequence.

AB  - Mathematics teachers want to enable students to understand mathematical objects clearly and want to use their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. To do so, it is suitable to use both TeX and Computer Algebra System (CAS). Nevertheless, the graphic output of CAS is not suited to the TeX document of the material. To improve it, since 2006, the authors have been developing KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS. The use of both TeX and KETpic based on CAS enables teachers to produce their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. They wish not only to produce their original class materials with figures but also to use the class materials with figures produced by the others. To realize that objective, a good KETpic programming style is needed. For example, when educators produce a figure along with their material by KETpic, they wish to perform symbolic thinking, i.e. they create a KETpic program in a mathematical drawing procedure and concentrate their energy on qualitative improvement of the figures while they recognize the global image of the figure. Symbolic thinking is a factor in good elements of KETpic programming style. The authors investigated other good elements of KETpic programming style using a documentation approach, which is the method of checking teachers' records in detail for their improvement. In this paper, the authors present four good elements of the KETpic programming style.

AB  - This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives." Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender. While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization.

AB  - This paper summarizes an event which brought together modeling experts, users, potential users and healthcare management practitioners to explore the question of evidence in the field of healthcare: how it is, and how it should be, used. The paper is an abridged version of a full report on the event. The paper highlights the high status accorded to empirical evidence (generated, in particular by randomized controlled trials), and suggests that a more balanced view of evidence, as being composed of empiricist, rationalist, and historicist material, is of value. Modeling and simulation constitute sources of rationalist evidence. Tensions between different types of evidence are identified, and the tension between statistics and stories as evidential forms is explored. The paper concludes on an optimistic note: there are clear signs that within the UK National Health Service, modeling and simulation are being taken more seriously as sources of evidence.

AB  - In recent years, a tremendous amount of effort has been devoted to modeling the cognition of human brain, particularly hypothesis generation process. Most research of the hypothesis generation model is probability-based. However, computation of human brains is still neuron-based instead of calculating the probability. As an attempt to solve this problem in this paper, we propose a novel neuron-based hypothesis generation model, called hypothesis generation net, to model human cognition, including how to make decisions and how to do actions. Basically, the proposed hypothesis generation model consists of two parts, i.e., a hypothesis model and an evaluation model. When these two models interact, the system is able to generate hypotheses to solve complex tasks based on historical experiences. To validate the feasibility of the proposed hypothesis generation model, we show a virtual robot with its cognition system can learn how to write Chinese calligraphy in a simulation environment, where an image-to-action translation via a cognitive framework is proposed to learn the pattern of Chinese characters. Based on the proposed deep thinking and learning mechanism, the virtual robot is able to write Chinese calligraphy well, which is a difficult task requiring extremely complicated motions, through thinking and practicing according to a human writing sample.

AB  - It is one of a teacher's challenges in lesson planning to consider all levels of learning involving students' team skills while taking the actual subject content into account. This descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.

AB  - Full paper, Research-to-Practice. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics.

AB  - Japan's elementary school educators are facing the difficult task of teaching computer programming education and computational thinking in a playful way which affords students' time to acquire new knowledge while discovering new technology. Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students.

AB  - While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.

AB  - Computer science education in primary and secondary schools uses the. visual programming language "Scratch " to learn computational thinking. However, the limited number of course hours and overwhelmed teachers delay students’ learning progression. Although many Scratch instructional videos are available online, students still fail because of a lack of keyword-searching ability. Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning "Scratch." This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need. We believe that through this recommendation system, intelligent hints in the form of videos can cultivate students’ self-learning ability and improve current teaching adversity.

AB  - Programming, most recently in the form of Computational Thinking (CT), is emerging as a new subject in primary schools worldwide. By data-based decision making, teachers, as learning designers, make decisions on instruction design based on a broad range of evidence, such as student assessment scores and classroom teaching observations. Given the current limitations on conclusive, field-proven teaching practices and an underlying “culture” to use as a basis, we turn to pertinent empirical studies that the growing scientific interest on introducing programming in primary school curricula has produced. The hypothesis is that we may overcome the lack of extensive experience in designing a programming course by reviewing the above evidence, in order to frame learning situations and methods.

AB  - There is a need to increase the number of students, especially women, choosing programming and STEM disciplines. We need innovative approaches in schools to better engage students and awake their interest in computer science. This paper addresses the need to create tools that effectively support the learning of programming and the development of computational thinking, highlighting why video games can be an effective educational tool for it and also attract new students to STEM. The Game4Coding Erasmus+ project proposes the design of a video game called CodeQuest, using a game genre that has not been frequently used before to address the teaching of programming, the monster tamer genre. We consider that video games have a number of benefits such as that stimulate active learning, are engaging for a wide range of students, and present information in a way that is attractive to learners. We want to explore this kind of game's effectiveness as a learning tool as well as its effect on the perception of STEM disciplines and programming to attract new public to coding (especially girls).

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been widely integrated into K-12 classrooms through programming education. Numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. Blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for K-12 programming courses. With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. Suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices.

AB  - In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.

AB  - Our objective is language-based search of large-scale image and video datasets. For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and reranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art. We also extend our method to the video domain, improving the state of the art on the VATEX dataset.

AB  - Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible changes to input pixels that can change the prediction of deep learning models. Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.

AB  - Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the objective function is a black box. However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these “grey-box” BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called “white-box” first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.

AB  - Neural models of code are successfully tackling various prediction tasks, complementing and sometimes even outperforming traditional program analyses. While most work focuses on end-to-end evaluations of such models, it often remains unclear what the models actually learn, and to what extent their reasoning about code matches that of skilled humans. A poor understanding of the model reasoning risks deploying models that are right for the wrong reason, and taking decisions based on spurious correlations in the training dataset. This paper investigates to what extent the attention weights of effective neural models match the reasoning of skilled humans. To this end, we present a methodology for recording human attention and use it to gather 1,508 human attention maps from 91 participants, which is the largest such dataset we are aware of. Computing human-model correlations shows that the copy attention of neural models often matches the way humans reason about code (Spearman rank coefficients of 0.49 and 0.47), which gives an empirical justification for the intuition behind copy attention. In contrast, the regular attention of models is mostly uncorrelated with human attention. We find that models and humans sometimes focus on different kinds of tokens, e.g., strings are important to humans but mostly ignored by models. The results also show that human-model agreement positively correlates with accurate predictions by a model, which calls for neural models that even more closely mimic human reasoning. Beyond the insights from our study, we envision the release of our dataset of human attention maps to help understand future neural models of code and to foster work on human-inspired models.

AB  - Cyber security experts in the U.S. and around the globe assess potential threats to their organizations by evaluating potential attackers' skills, knowledge, resources, access to the target organization and motivation to offend (i.e. SKRAM). Unfortunately, this model fails to incorporate insights regarding online offenders' traits and the conditions surrounding the development of online criminal event. Drawing on contemporary criminological models, we present a theoretical rationale for revising the SKRAM model. The revised model suggests that in addition to the classical SKRAM components, both individual attributes and certain offline and online circumstances fuel cyber attackers' motivation to offend, and increase the probability that a cyber-attack will be launched against an organization. Consistent with our proposed model, and its potential in predicting the occurrence of different types of cyber-dependent crimes against organizations, we propose that Information Technology professionals' efforts to facilitate safe computing environments should design new approaches for collecting indicators regarding attackers' potential threat, and predicting the occurrence and timing of cyber-dependent crimes.

AB  - We present a comprehensive study on a new task named image color aesthetics assessment (ICAA), which aims to assess color aesthetics based on human perception. ICAA is important for various applications such as imaging measurement and image analysis. However, due to the highly diverse aesthetic preferences and numerous color combinations, ICAA presents more challenges than conventional image quality assessment tasks. To advance ICAA research, 1) we propose a baseline model called the Delegate Transformer, which not only deploys deformable transformers to adaptively allocate interest points, but also learns human color space segmentation behavior by the dedicated module. 2) We elaborately build a color-oriented dataset, ICAA17K, containing 17K images, covering 30 popular color combinations, 80 devices and 50 scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 1,500 people. Moreover, we develop a large-scale benchmark of 15 methods, the most comprehensive one thus far based on two datasets, SPAQ and ICAA17K. Our work, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but more importantly offers the community a roadmap to explore solutions for ICAA. Code and dataset are available in here.

AB  - A systematic and consistent framework for software modeling is introduced, being the core of a Software-Intensive-Systems-Engineering (SWISE) academic course, which has been taught by the author in over 50 classes over 12 years. The approach is based upon a general perception and definition of a “system” which can be applied to any level of system decomposition, throughout subsystems, components, units etc. Five principle levels-of-interest are introduced and appropriate UML models are suggested at each level, preserving model consistency within and between levels. Each modeled entity along the process possesses a functional, a structural and a behavioral model. The use of models is demonstrated not only at the analysis and design stages of development but also at the integration and testing stages. The entire agenda of the SWISE course is presented, detailing the instructional tools and case-studies used during the course.

AB  - Proof-of-Learning (PoL) proposes that a model owner logs training checkpoints to establish a proof of having expended the computation necessary for training. The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing—computing a proof for a stolen model—is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has invalidated this observation.In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of PoL—meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof. On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to open problems in learning theory. We conclude that one cannot develop a provably robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization in deep learning.

AB  - Deep neural networks using for real-world classification task require high reliability and robustness. However, the Softmax output by the last layer of network is often over-confident. We propose a novel confidence estimation method by considering model quality for deep classification models. Two metrics, MQ-Repres and MQ-Discri are developed accordingly to evaluate the model quality, and also provide a new confidence estimation called MQ-Conf for online inference. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by the $3D$ semantic segmentation tasks using three different deep networks. Through confusion analysis and feature visualization we show the rationality and reliability of the model quality quantification method.11This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U22A2061 and High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University.

AB  - Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

AB  - The design process is often characterized by and realized through the iterative steps of evaluation and refinement. When the process is based on a single creative domain such as visual art or audio production, designers primarily take inspiration from work within their domain and refine it based on their own intuitions or feedback from an audience of experts from within the same domain. What happens, however, when the creative process involves more than one creative domain such as in a digital game? How should the different domains influence each other so that the final outcome achieves a harmonized and fruitful communication across domains? How can a computational process orchestrate the various computational creators of the corresponding domains so that the final game has the desired functional and aesthetic characteristics? To address these questions, this paper identifies game facet orchestration as the central challenge for artificial-intelligence-based game generation, discusses its dimensions, and reviews research in automated game generation that has aimed to tackle it. In particular, we identify the different creative facets of games, propose how orchestration can be facilitated in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, review indicative preliminary examples of orchestration, and conclude by discussing the open questions and challenges ahead.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected appliances, sensors, and databases that aim to improve human life quality in various life fields. To enhance agricultural productivity quantitively and in terms of quality, farmers have adopted the emerging IoT and communication technologies to establish automated monitoring and control systems. This adoption of novel technologies enables farmers to deal with traditional practice problems. However, the solutions provided by this new concept reveal a wide range of research issues. Since security and privacy are the top concerns in IoT environments, it's important to think about potential attacks and develop countermeasures. In this paper, we present a simple security analysis in the IoT-based smart agriculture field. Then, considering the crucial role of authentication in IoT security, we reviewed the different classes of authentication in this field.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate biological functions by interacting with specific RNAs, and play an important role in many life activities. Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.

The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education.

AB  - Coding (programming) is a skill that nowadays is considered as an important asset. Teaching programming is an activity that becomes more and more popular. In the last few years there are great discussions on inclusion of coding in schools. These initiatives impacted the policy makers in Macedonia to include coding as a part of a new compulsory subject for the pupils at the age of 8. In this paper our focus is on the newest change in the Macedonian curriculum - the introduction of the course "Working with computers and basics of programming", which can be shortly named as "Computing" in 2015. Here, we present the proposed and accepted curriculum with emphasis on the topics about computational thinking and programming. Then we discuss the available software and tools suitable for the implementation of the before mentioned topics, and present a newly developed game. At the end we explain the background of the teachers, give the format of the preliminary training of all primary school teachers in the country and present the first impressions of the trainers that conducted the training, and we elaborate the teachers' feedback.

AB  - We introduce a new research area in visual analytics (VA) aiming to bridge existing gaps between methods of interactive machine learning (ML) and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), on one side, and human minds, on the other side. The gaps are, first, a conceptual mismatch between ML/XAI outputs and human mental models and ways of reasoning, and second, a mismatch between the information quantity and level of detail and human capabilities to perceive and understand. A grand challenge is to adapt ML and XAI to human goals, concepts, values, and ways of thinking. Complementing the current efforts in XAI towards solving this challenge, VA can contribute by exploiting the potential of visualization as an effective way of communicating information to humans and a strong trigger of human abstractive perception and thinking. We propose a cross-disciplinary research framework and formulate research directions for VA.

AB  - One argument in the discussion about the adoption of UML in industry is the supposedly large effort it takes to do modeling. Our study explores how the creation of UML models can be understood to consist of different cognitive activities: (i) designing: thinking about the design (ideation, key-design decision making), (ii) notation expression: expressing a design in a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in a diagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of 100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on software models as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% of the effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing. Notation expression is around 41% of the model creation effort and layouting is in the order of 3%. This finding suggests that a significant part of creating models is devoted to design thinking about the problem.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are being criticized for copyright infringement, inadvertent bias in training data, a danger to human innovation, the possibility of distributing incorrect or misleading information, and prejudice. Due to their popularity among students, the introduction of many comparable apps, and the inability to resist unfair and fraudulent student usage, their educational use needs to be adapted and harmonized. The incorporation of LLMs should be defined not only by pedagogues and educational institutions, but also by students who will actively utilize them to learn and prepare assignments. In order to find out what students from two universities think and suggest about LLMs use in education, they were asked to give their contribution by answering the survey that was conducted at the beginning of the spring semester of academic 2022/23. Their feedback was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, showing in a better light what students think about LLMs and how and why they would use them. Based on the analysis, the authors propose an original strategy for integrating LLMs into education. The proposed approach is also adapted for those students who are not interested in using LLMs and for those who prefer the hybrid mode by combining their own research with LLMs generated recommendations. The authors expect that by implementing the proposed strategy, schools will benefit from a better education in which research, creativity, academic honesty, recognition of false information, and the ability to improve knowledge will prevail.

AB  - As a summer camp for middle school and high school students, a new method of learning/teaching computer science was explored: Teaching high schoolers MIT's App Inventor for 2 weeks and then during the following two weeks, having the high schoolers teach middle schoolers ranging from upcoming 6th to 9th graders. The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with. This paper presents the organization of the summer programming camp, contents and learning outcome.

AB  - Existing studies on the propagation of infectious diseases have not sufficiently considered the uncertainties that are related to individual behavior and its influence on individual decision making to prevent infections, even though it is well known that changes in behavior can lead to variations in the macrodynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. These influencing factors can be categorized into emotion-related and cognition-related components. We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example. We find that individual decision making against infections (frequent washing, respirator usage, and crowd contact avoidance) can significantly decrease the at-peak number of infected patients, even when common policies, such as isolation and vaccination, are not deployed.

AB  - The amount of technologies that appear every day as educational applications is surprising. Within the sciences area we can highlight the technologies for the study of programming and robotics, that help students of all skill levels to develop their logical thinking and propose functional prototypes to solve their problems of everyday life. The applicability of these technologies makes them excellent learning objects by allowing interaction with learners. This article presents a case of successful implementation of a robotics lab for a city of the state of Espirito Santo, in Brazil, which is now in replication, to ensure access to this technology to all students of elementary school. With the help of robotics learning objects, such as LEGO Mindstorms kit, Arduino boards, programming simulators and Internet of Things concepts, we propose here a methodology based on leaning projects for learning technological concepts of robotics and computer automation.

AB  - Classifying the cognitive levels of assessment questions according to Bloom’s taxonomy can help instructors design effective assessments that are well aligned with the intended learning outcomes. However, the classification process is time consuming and requires experience. Many studies have attempted to automate the process by utilizing different machine learning and text mining approaches, but none has examined the classification of Arabic questions. The purpose of this study is to examine this research gap and to introduce a new feature extraction method that would better suit Arabic questions and their unique characteristics. It also aims to provide Arab instructors with a tool that can help them automatically classify their assessment questions. To accomplish this purpose, the study developed a dataset of more than 600 Arabic assessment questions. It then proposed a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method for extracting features from Arabic questions. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, the proposed method was designed to take the nature of assessment questions into consideration. It was evaluated by comparing it to two methods that have been used for classifying English questions, i.e., the traditional TF-IDF and a modified TF-IDF method called term frequency part-of-speech-inverse document frequency (TFPOS-IDF). A t-test was utilized to examine whether the difference in performance between the three methods was statistically significant. The proposed method outperformed the two other methods. The overall accuracy, precision, and recall scored by the proposed method were significantly higher than those scored by the traditional TF-IDF and TFPOS-IDF methods. The evaluation results indicate the promising potential of the proposed method, which can be extended to other languages.

AB  - Higher education confers numerous benefits both to the individual and to society, including higher earnings, lower rates of unemployment and government dependency, an increased tax base, and greater civic engagement. Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier “employment difficulties” (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are “lack of entrepreneurship skills” (H11), “high cost” (H10), “longer payback duration” (H1), “10 yr. ROI” (H9), and “lack of data analytic skills” (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them. This paper also contributes to the literature a first-hand, formal study on the prioritization of barriers to international MBA enrolments.

AB  - Business and data understanding, that aims to identify multiple mining tasks, is the most primary phase in planning a practical data mining project. However, traditional tasks determination problem could only be solved by experienced analysts, which suffers from high communication cost and low efficiency. In this paper, we study the automatic task discovery method following the problem solving theory. First, we establish the concept network (CN) model to represent human knowledge and experience in the problem solving process. Then, we propose and demonstrate the structure of two major mining tasks (clustering and classification) in a CN. Finally, a data mining tasks discovery method (DMTD) is put forward, followed by two analysis subject evaluation algorithms. Experiment results illustrate that the DMTD is able to discover all the potential mining tasks from a predefined concept network, filtered by the important or interesting analysis subjects. Moreover, these tasks defined by the DMTD are proven to be available and valuable by fifty published papers.

AB  - In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection and system level power reduction of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) Edge sensors. The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.

In order to develop efficient technology for effective energy extraction from a solar PV system, this paper investigates and compares typical maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategies used in solar PV industry. This paper focuses especially on how sampling rate and time delay influence PV system performance by using different MPPT control approaches in a digital control environment, and how different MPPT techniques behave under highly dynamic and variable weather conditions. A computational experiment system is developed by using MatLab, SimPowerSystems and Opal-RT real-time simulation system for fast and accurate performance evaluations of PV arrays under high frequency switching conditions of power converters. Advantages, disadvantages, and characteristics of different MPPT techniques are studied, evaluated, and compared through extensive computational experiments.

AB  - This study explains the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for `fun-based' interactive programming instruction in engineering education courses. Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.'

Social Digital Literacy (SDL) is the way in which people use social media to enhance their social network, effectively increase their knowledge base, while communicating clearly and professionally through the use of social media. The increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. In order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. By increasing their SDL proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media. The expectation is that the approach being used can be implemented in any introductory programming course.

AB  - Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.

AB  - Mamdani inference model is widely used in that kind of engineering applications, in which imprecision, subjectivity, or uncertainty should be handled in the data and in the evaluation process. Its popularity is coming from its operation is very close to the human thinking. Although, it has high computational needs. Final step of the conventional model is the defuzzification, where a crisp value is assigned to the aggregated result of the system to represent it. This value should be selected in such a way as to best represent the result of the evaluation. For this reason, to select the best fitted defuzzification method is essential. In this paper two of the commonly used defuzzification methods are introduced, and a correction value is proposed to improve the result of MOM (Mean of Maxima) defuzzification method. The proposed modification was studied both in the conventional Mamdani, and Mamdani-like model using discretized output.

AB  - The appearance of MOOCs has boosted the creation of educational material for use in all possible contexts. However, this material is often created without much thought and without proper tools and methodologies. Much more attention should be placed on the design of educational material, since this is the basis for a successful learning experience. In this special session, we report about several interesting approaches towards the design and creation of educational material that range from the call to the definition of a discipline of Courseware Engineering, to a methodology for video recording, another one for the creation of smart adaptive content, tools metrics for teaching computational thinking, the integration of OERs, and the design and application of game-based material.

AB  - The program “Introduction to programming in the first cycle of basic education” initiated in 2015 has provided the opportunity to develop computational thinking and digital literacy among students. The existing literature suggests that Scratch programming language may have a strong influence on the skills acquired by students in classroom. In this context, it is intended to build an intervention with objectives that fit into the Student Profile leaving compulsory education and developed within the scope of curricular flexibility, recommended for the 1st year of basic education. The applied methodology aims to evaluate the impact on students' knowledge (mathematics and mother tongue), attitudes (in relation to knowledge and citizenship) and on the capacities (cognitive, emotional and practical) as well as in the school community (students, teachers and families).

AB  - How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.

AB  - A game plays a very important role to children. Everything that is done through the game is easier to accept and longer to remember. This paper describes a method that, although it originated forty years ago, can provide surprisingly a lot to today's generation of students. The method helps in the development of computational thinking and computer-free programming in children at early school age. In particular, in this paper, the examples are given on how to use methods to realize and carry out learning outcomes according to the curriculum for the 1st grade of primary school and present a real example of their use in mathematics classes in teaching practice. The results of this work can be an incentive to all of those whose interest is the further development of learning programming and mathematics through a game in young children.

AB  - Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.

AB  - For the teaching status of Python Programming course in financial and economic colleges and universities, this paper analyzes the common shortcomings and proposes the reconstruction of the program design course from four aspects: teaching objectives, course contents, teaching methods and assessment methods. That is, under the teaching objectives and principles based on market demand, the teaching contents should be integrated, the practice teaching should be strengthened, multi-dimensional hybrid teaching methods and procedural assessment should be used for the purpose of stimulating students' interests, keeping high motivation. Finally, it can mobilize students' enthusiasm for independent learning, and cultivating their ability to solve complex professional problems with computational thinking.

AB  - The programming education for the students set off a global enthusiasm. The Block-Python programming tools can fill the gap from block-based programming to language coding. However, there is little work focus on the evaluation metrics for block-based python code. The past block-oriented evaluation metrics based on Computational Thinking (CT) were not language-oriented, and program volume was often ignored. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metrics for block-based python code, which combines the CT dimensions and program volume. The experimental results show that the correlations between the proposed metrics and Halstead, McCabe complexity algorithms are both above 0.7, which is higher than Dr. Scratch.

AB  - Learning how to program can enhance the learners' logic reasoning and computational thinking abilities, so coding education become an important policy in many countries. At the same time, there are many visualized block programming environment developed after MIT Scratch was launched. Nevertheless, how to conduct coding education is still a big problem without appropriate programming competence indicator. As a result, this study is to constructing a series of programming competence indicator for K-12 students by adopting Delphi study technique. This study invites 15 experts including experienced elementary and high schools teachers, to survey and provide suggestions for this indicator. After three rounds of Delphi study, this study completed 5-level programming competence, including detailed content of indicators, learning and instructional methods, and learning environments. The proposed indicators can be used for formal coding curriculum in schools systematically, and informal education such as self-directed learning or cram schools.

The planning tool presented in this paper was used to engage elementary students in an activity to design and then create a video game using an agent-based programming environment. The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.

AB  - This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.
