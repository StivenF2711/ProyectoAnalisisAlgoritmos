AB  - Model Driven Engineering proposes the use of models as the main development artifacts. This methodology involves generating code from models and then perhaps adding some details to the generated code. Frequently, it is required to also reverse-engineer code to generate models. Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented programming platform. A functional layer of an airline reservation system is presented as a case study.

AB  - This study aims to investigate Taiwanese EFL college students' perceptions of the potentials of computer games for language learning. The participants are required to play two selected video games, Sid Meier's Pirates and Telltale Sam & Max in the researcher's computer assisted language learning class. To elicit participants' perceptions of computer games, researchers asked them to write a reflection paper after they had played these two games for more than ten hours. The findings show that most students believe that suitable computer games can assist second language learning. The strengths and weaknesses of using computer games in language education are also discussed in this paper.

It is hypothesized that by augmenting a touch screen display with audio feedback, blind user would be able to have two-dimensional perspective in their mental model. If their mental model of a web page is two-dimensional, the blind people should be able to gain an overview of the web pages accurately, which is important for navigation of the web page. This paper discusses an on-going study to elicit mental models from the blind users using diagrammatic epresentation. The study so far revealed that there is a significant difference between performances using screen-reader program and touch-screen display with audio feedback. However, the performance seems to be affected by page complexity.

AB  - Now a day's, online reviews has become one of the most important part of any business. Posting reviews online for products bought or services received has become a trendy approach for people to express opinions and sentiments, which is essential for business intelligence, vendors and other interested parties. Social media like Twitter contains rich information about people's preferences. In this paper movie domain is considered for data mining. For dealing the problem of review mining for predicting sales performance, we have used massive collection of online reviews from IMDB along with thoughts of people about movies from Twitter; both are mined and processed by applying various algorithms. Our analysis shows that both Sentiments captured from reviews and tweets have a major impact on the future sales performance of the movie. For the sentiment factor, we have used Sentiment Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (S-PLSA) model it is a probabilistic approach to analyzing the sentiments in reviews and tweets, which provides succinct summary of the sentiment information. The summarization of both reviews and tweets in terms of sentiments along with additional input of the box office collection from IMDB is given to an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model (ARSA) for sales prediction. After that we have done sentiment analysis of online reviews. In sentiment analysis reviews are classified into negative and positive. We used a simple metric P-N ratio to predict the success of movies i.e. Hit, Average, Flop.

AB  - The rapid growth of internet access has given rise to a digital era. The availability of internet access has pushed almost 70% of the population to switch to internet for their daily needs and accessories. Mainly, E-commerce platforms are being used at a much higher rate than ever before. People who buy from these e-commerce platforms make decisions on whether to buy a product or not solely based on the ratings and reviews of a product that are provided by these platforms. Due to the simple nature of this review system, sellers and even individuals tend to exploit it by writing dishonest reviews with an intention of either boosting its ratings or simply to sabotage it. These fake reviews are aimed at deceiving customers and convince them to buy/deter a certain product. Due to the lack of a robust system to identify real and fake reviews, these spams manage to show up on top. To avoid this problem and provide a more efficient way to filter and provide a more efficient way to reviews. This work focus on designing machine learning model for fake review detection and compare the performance of three different algorithms. As a result of this research work random forest algorithm outperform than other two algorithms. Web based User Interface(UI) designed to remove fake review and display trusted review based on the ranking.

Modelling is a known method to handle the complexity of educational games and reduce development cost via automatic code generation. This paper reviews several modelling languages for modelling educational games under the adventure genre. The objective of the review is to assess the coverage of these modelling languages against known adventure genre and flow theory concepts. The assessment result shows that existing modelling languages do not cover all concepts in the adventure genre and flow theory. The effect of not covering these concepts towards game development and game effectiveness as a learning tool are also discussed.

AB  - Modeling and simulating a real world scenario is fundamentally an abstraction that takes only part of the given scenario into the model. Furthermore, the level of detail in the model, a.k.a. the resolution, plays an important role in the modeling and simulation process. Finally, the abstraction and resolution of the model determine the fidelity of the modeling and simulation, which becomes the ultimate utility for the model users. While abstraction, resolution and fidelity are the corner stones of the modeling and simulation discipline, they are often casually utilized. Moreover, their interplay is not investigated in-depth with explicit operationalization of the concepts. This article operationalizes the concept of abstraction, resolution, and fidelity by focusing on the aspect of model information. This theoretic investigation answers propositions involving these concepts, i.e. whether or not a higher resolution model has higher fidelity and why, through set theoretic approaches.

AB  - This paper introduces trust and unauthorized operation to traditional RBAC model, and proposes a trust and unauthorized operation based RBAC model (TUORBAC model). The model has greatly improved in safety compared to traditional RBAC model. Before user activates the roles, TUORBAC model downgrade the roles of user according to the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation. When the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation is high, we directly downgrade roles of user to the lowest. Otherwise, we calculate the value of trust, and downgrade the roles of user according to the value of trust, finally activate downgrade roles. In addition, the model introduces downgrade roles, which stored downgrade roles of user. If downgrade roles are nonempty, we directly activate downgrade roles without re-judged, which improves the efficiency of the system.

AB  - Spatial cognition is a typical human cognitive activity. It is attractive that human can interact with the robot naturally and efficiently in the task of spatial cognition. And so many of scientists have thrown themselves into the research of that great thing. This paper systematically summarized the related work of human-robot natural interaction in spatial cognition tasks. We arranged this paper in two parts, the analysis of spatial cognition tasks and cognition modeling respectively. And the progress of cognitive architecture was highlighted here. In addition, we studied how to realize the human-robot natural interaction through combining the natural interaction technologies and cognitive modeling. And we proposed a design framework of human-robot spatial cognition interaction system based on ACT-R theory. In the end, we put forward our prospect and discussion about this research area. Our work mainly aims at making a contribution to realizing human-robot natural interaction in spatial cognition tasks.

AB  - The design of object-oriented systems starts with modeling, a process to identify core concepts and their relations. Mainstream modeling techniques can be either informal (white board, CRC cards, etc.) or formal (e.g., UML editors). The former support well the creative modeling process, but their output is difficult to store, process and maintain. The latter reduce these problems, at the expense of creativity and productivity because they are tedious and not trivial to use. We present Cel, a touch- and gesture-based iPad application to rapidly create, manipulate, and store language agnostic object-oriented software models, based on a minimal set of constructs.

AB  - Quality Engineering Education has been identified as the foremost thrust area in India. The thrust is mainly due to the new establishment/enrichment of various core engineering industry sectors like Automobile, Healthcare, Agriculture, Avionics, Structural, Telecommunication and Mobile Technologies. Currently even though the country graduates a bulk volume of engineers every year, a major composition of this volume is drained to IT service sectors for employment. To enhance the above thrust of the country many engineering education institutions started focusing on quality of the offered education in terms of numerical ability, creativity and design ability of engineers. The Course Outcomes and Programme Specific Outcomes have been designed with the above focus as a guideline. More emphasis on integration of technology into instruction with learner-centric approach is encouraged. Simulation tools as teaching aids will enrich the understanding ability of the learner. In this work the confidence level of the learners to attain the course level objectives through simulation based teaching pedagogy has been explored. The survey records ensure the impact of this innovative instructional design for the desired course outcomes.

AB  - Nowadays, the services on the World Wide Web (WWW) are proliferating dramatically. The relationships of invoking among these services are becoming more and more complicated. The performances of traditional automated service composition methods suffer from the complexity of the service composition problem. Hence it is hardly to apply these automated methods in real cases. Semi-automated service composition is an alternative for coping with the complexity of service composition. A novel end-user oriented service composition model based on quotient space theory and service relation diagram is presented. This model proposes a hierarchical service composition from coarse-grain to fine-grain. The performance analysis and simulation showed that this model can reduce the complexity of service composition efficiently.

AB  - The importance of teaching a solid design methodology is well-recognized and is the goal of many software development courses. There is an ongoing debate concerning how to approach the learning and teaching of this skill, i.e., by focusing on “design first” by means of the UML formalism or by “OO programming first”, deferring the development of UML specifications. This work presents a teaching experience and curriculum content where a “design-first” approach was used to teach Object Oriented Design, incrementally interleaved with Object Oriented Programming aimed at implementing the modeled software through laboratory activities. Working in groups allowed the students to improve communication and collaboration skills, and the use of web 2.0 technologies, such as a wiki, allowed for better course management and for the deployment of a project involving all the students. This approach was used in two year-long courses with students who had slightly different backgrounds and dispositions. Also presented are a preliminary analysis of the written examinations and laboratory exercises; an analysis of common errors and student misconceptions and a preliminary quantitative measure of the results.

AB  - 1 in 88 children is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Specific software, virtual worlds, and games may be used to improve social and language skills. These tools may be combined with the DIR/Floortime therapeutic model that encourages parents, teachers, and therapists to engage these children through their own (sometimes limited) interests. Applying this framework, this paper suggests the creation of a workshop modeled after the Computer Clubhouse, as developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which would take advantage of the children's sometimes above-average analytic and visual abilities. Participants would produce their own video games with Scratch or other age-appropriate tool. In this way, children on the autism spectrum could pursue their interests in computers and games while strengthening their creativity and problem-solving skills: areas that are sometimes difficult for those with the disorder.

AB  - We ran the first Affective Movement Recognition (AffectMove) challenge that brings together datasets of affective bodily behaviour across different real-life applications to foster work in this area. Research on automatic detection of naturalistic affective body expressions is still lagging behind detection based on other modalities whereas movement behaviour modelling is a very interesting and very relevant research problem for the affective computing community. The AffectMove challenge aimed to take advantage of existing body movement datasets to address key research problems of automatic recognition of naturalistic and complex affective behaviour from this type of data. Participating teams competed to solve at least one of three tasks based on datasets of different sensors types and real-life problems: multimodal EmoPain dataset for chronic pain physical rehabilitation context, weDraw-l Movement dataset for maths problem solving settings, and multimodal Unige-Maastricht Dance dataset. To foster work across datasets, we also challenged participants to take advantage of the data across datasets to improve performances and also test the generalization of their approach across different applications.

AB  - Collaboration is an important feature of scientific practice. Scientists share, discuss and critically argue over different representations of a problem with others when attempting to generate new knowledge. Similarly, collaboration can be beneficial for inquiry-based science learning at school. Successful collaborative learning, however, relies on engaging students in a condition of positive interdependence. In this paper we propose that asymmetric simulations provide an innovative way to establish positive interdependence among students during inquiry learning which will foster the development of their collaboration skills. Asymmetric simulations divide some information or resources necessary to solve a problem unevenly among group members, thereby requiring more equal participation and contribution among all members during collaboration. The asymmetric simulations we developed are available online for free via the Go-Lab portal (golabz.eu) and therefore can be easily integrated into a digital lesson by school teachers. They were created taking into account the small screen sizes of smart devices such as smartphones or tablets, thereby making them convenient for collaborative work in school classrooms.

AB  - In today's world with ever increasing amount of text assets overloaded on web with digitized libraries, sorting out these documents got developed into a feasible need. Document clustering is an important procedure which consequently sorts out huge number of articles into a modest number of balanced gatherings. Document clustering is making groups of similar documents into number of clusters such that documents within the same group with high similarity values among one another and dissimilar to documents from other clusters. Common applications of document Clustering includes grouping similar news articles, analysis of customer feedback, text mining, duplicate content detection, finding similar documents, search optimization and many more. This lead to utilization of these documents for finding required information in a competent and efficient manner. Document clustering required a measurement for evaluating how surprising two given information are. This dissimilarity is often estimated by using some distance measures, for example, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean distance, etc. In our work, we evaluated and analyzed how effective these measures are in partitioned clustering for text document datasets. In our experiments we have used standard K-means algorithm and our results details on six text documents datasets and five most commonly used distance or similarity measures in text clustering.

AB  - Human brain is a vital organ in the human body which has more than 100 billion nerves. They communicate through synapses. Few important things governed by brain are memory, emotions, creativity, intelligence etc. The human mind has three fundamental functions like figure out, react and relish. These functions of the mind are guided by one native egocentrism or potential rational capacities. Egocentric inclination happens involuntarily. ASD better termed as developmental delays. It can cause challenges in social interaction, behaviour and communication. Diagnosis of Autism includes both psychological and neurological examination. Early detection of the neurological markers with the help of MRI can help in to more accurate diagnosis. A combination of S-MRI (Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and Rs-fMRI (Resting State- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in learning all characteristics of brain. Full brain connectivity and signal intensities of Region of Interest can be acquired using various atlases. ASD destroys the structure of the functional connectivity between the multiple brain regions. Deep learning methods proves to be successful in classification of imaging data. Provided with multi modal details provided by different MRI procedures, using a deep learning network can provide accurate classification results. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks can help in classifying whether the person has ASD or not. Given a FC matrix of the brain it is really huge to differentiate the significant features. Thus, it is requiring for dimensionality reduction. So, the purpose of using deep learning model using MRI is to identify Autism in early stage and to start with therapies.

AB  - At present, group cooperative learning has received widespread attention as an important mode of independent and inquiry learning. However, during the implementation process, many students were not clear about their learning goals and did not like to discuss research with their classmates. It leads to learning to stay on the surface of formality. In order to solve the above problems and improve the effect of group cooperative learning, many researchers have conducted extensive explorations from the perspective of tools and strategies. Among them, the knowledge graph can visualize the relationship between knowledge points. It characterizes the changes in students' cognitive status during the learning process, guides learners to construct knowledge autonomously, and provides the possibility to solve problems such as the confusion of knowledge structure. At the same time, studies have shown that collaborative knowledge construction has a significant promotion effect on teachers' online learning, and is beneficial to teachers' professional development. Technologically supported collaborative knowledge construction can not only promote the efficiency of knowledge acquisition, but also enhance the effect of communication and interaction, and increase the degree of participation in learning. It is an effective method to enhance the depth and breadth of the interaction of students' learning. Therefore, this study combines the construction of knowledge graphs and group cooperative learning to create a group knowledge graph learning tool based on a group to explore its influence on learners' knowledge ability level and interactive characteristics.

ELCS aims to provide teachers and high school learners with flexible-to-adopt, ease-of-use, from-concrete-to-abstract, and from-observation-to-experimentation digital materials on computer science concepts and to fulfill the High School Computer Curricula of Taiwan 2010. Various types of digital media, such as graphics, pictures, animations, simulations, instructional games, etc., were employed to implement four types of learning objects, including examples of concrete experiences, contexts for reflective observation, conceptual models for abstract conceptualization and contexts for active experimentation. A quality evaluation of content expert review revealed that the design of ELCS instructional simulations were appropriate for learning computer science concepts as measured from the perspective of technology acceptance. Further efforts were suggested to examine the effectiveness of types of instructional simulations for the target learners.

AB  - Advanced information technology and educational technology are used in Smart Classroom. More and more educators are paying attention to and studying how to combine the two reasonably and exert the best effect. At present, the widely accepted teaching model based on Smart Classroom is "Pre-class + In-class + After-class". The results of practice show that not all the knowledge is suitable for this model and its teaching efficiency can be further improved. In order to make Smart Classroom more efficient, this paper proposes a teaching framework based on Smart Classroom, and designs different teaching models for different types of knowledge under this framework. The results of practice show that the teaching efficiency of the proposed framework is more remarkable.

This paper shares the experiences carried to interact and communicate in an effective way with Millennial Learner. As millennial learners have a very short span of attention & concentration, hence effective interaction with these learners is possible through information and communication technology (ICT). As today's generation is very closer to technology and more comfortable in using it, ICT is one of the solutions to improve teaching and learning process. Usage of ICT has various aspects. It is possible to use ICT more effectively in a urban location where internet facility and infrastructure facilities are easily available. It may become somewhat difficult in rural location due to insufficient infrastructural facilities.

AB  - Facial expression recognition (FER) is the key to understanding human emotions and feelings. It is an active area of research since human thoughts can be collected, processed, and used in customer satisfaction, politics, and medical domains. Automated FER systems had been developed and have been used to recognize humans' emotions but it has been a quite challenging problem in machine learning due to the high intra-class variation. The first models were using known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayes classifier, Fuzzy Techniques, Feature Selection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in their models but still, some limitations affect the accuracy critically such as subjectivity, occlusion, pose, low resolution, scale, illumination variation, etc. The ability of CNN boosts FER accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have emerged as the greatest way to produce the best results in FER in recent years. Various datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models. FER2013, CK+, JAFFE and FERG are some of the most popular datasets. To improve the accuracy of FER models, one dataset or a mix of datasets has been employed. Every dataset includes limitations and issues that have an impact on the model that is trained for it. As a solution to this problem, our state-of-the-art model based on deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network architectures (CNN) with supportive techniques has been implemented. The proposed model achieved 93.7% accuracy with the combination of FER2013 and CK+ datasets for FER2013.

AB  - This challenges and open problems paper discusses the role of software engineers when combining modeling with Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE). With SBSE techniques increasingly providing insights into difficult software modeling problems, the role of the software engineer might be thought of as diminishing. However, given the crucial role of the model understanding in SBSE, we argue that the role of the software engineer will become more important through interactive SBSE, although exploiting this interaction remains a challenge for the field.

At the same time, the main goal of the information based educational environment should be to ensure the transition of education to a new level of quality, i.e., to a state corresponding to the development of the information society and the associated need of specialists of appropriate skill levels. Currently, there is an active search for new forms and methods of teaching, which makes it possible to talk about the transition of education from a directive model to an interactive, learner's personality-oriented, more productive, one. The article deals with the possibility of using innovative teaching methods in preparing technical university students. Also, advantages and disadvantages of traditional and innovative teaching methods are described, through the development, application and implementation of innovative technologies.

Recommender System is software application that uses filtering techniques and algorithms to generate personalized preferences to support decision making of the users. Collaborative Filtering is one type of recommender system that finds neighbors of users on the basis of similar rated items by users or common users of items. It suffers from data sparsity and inaccuracy issues. In this paper, concept of typicality from cognitive psychology is used to find the neighbors of users on the basis of on their typicality degree in user groups. Typicality based Collaborative Filtering (TyCo) approach using K-means and Topic model based clustering is compared in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

AB  - The ABET engineering criteria was first formulated and introduced to the American education system in the middle 1990s. The ABET accreditation system defines an engineering graduate according to Blooms Taxonomy. As a part of the continuing curriculum improvement at Bucknell University, a new junior-level design course has been recently introduced into the curriculum. The course title is ECEG 301: Praxis for Engineering Design. The objectives of this course are manifold, but is primarily designed to pave the way to improved student performance in senior design projects, promote team-work and hands-on experiences, and to enhance student completion of ABET outcomes, particularly criteria (c to h). Examples of the course contents include computer aided design (Solidworks®), 3-D printing, design process elements, functional decomposition, fabrication, implementation, and simulation of photovoltaic systems. The course also aims at introducing students to crucial and current societal and environmental issues. In this paper, the results of the multiple projects are discussed. Based on anecdotal data analysis and feedback from students and faculty, the assigned projects have encouraged students' creativity and enhanced their ability to work on multidisciplinary teams. The inclusion of similar courses in undergraduate engineering curriculum would definitely improve students' hands on experiences and prepare them for more complex design challenges.

PLM brought experience and expertise based knowledge driven product representation. It integrated huge amount information about product objects, processes, activities, analyses, methodologies, equipment, devices, and communications in active knowledge driven complex model. This model supposed advanced computer system. Currently, inherent characteristics of PLM modeling give new chance for higher education to turn towards case study and project based course programs while save theoretical content. In this paper, analysis and explanation of the new world of virtual engineering is introduced and discussed in order to conceptualize a future vision of higher education in engineering. Main contribution of this paper is practice oriented concept and model of course where theory and practice is harmonized in integrated teaching content using advanced PLM environment. Affect of PLM on curriculum is other main issue in this contribution.

AB  - Adaptable Model Versioning (AMOR) is a framework intended to be adapted for versioning of model artefacts. AMOR framework is known for some limitations in the operation and conflict detection process, as well as in the conflict resolution process. This paper presents an attempt to improve AMOR framework using Critical Pair Analysis (CPA), a computation conducted to determine potential conflicts between a pair of operations. CPA computation results are used to detect conflicts between operations and also to determine the conflict resolutions. The test results show higher accuracy for the operation detection process, but they also show a slower performance. For the conflict resolution process, the use of CPA provides a fast and accurate result.

AB  - Game-based learning or educational games has a constantly positive impact on learners while offering a variety of knowledge presentations and providing multiple opportunities to be applied during learning process. The development of an effective educational game has been a challenge for game developers to understand the depth and relationships between game play (rules and regulations), game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter (subject content, learners, teachers) embedded in the educational game. Thus, the authors have proposed a multi-domain framework with extracted implicit vaguely supported relationships through a systematic literature review. These relationships are verified through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts to validate the relationships. This paper presents seven (7) implicit relationships based on game play domain and discusses their relevancy with game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach of qualitative study. Consequently, this paper concludes seven (7) explicit relationships in perspective of game play for game developers to reflect on during the development process of educational games.

Proactive control of the SCAUI state includes ongoing conducting assessment of airport AS quality by experts, identification of SCAUI elements (functional state of AS employees, characteristics of technical systems and devices) that have a predominant influence on AS, and improvement of their performance. This article presents principles of the model and the method for conducting expert quality assessment of airport AS, whose application allows to increase the efficiency and quality of AS assessment by experts, and, consequently, the quality of SCAUI state control.

In spite of the phenomenal growth of MOOCs, people in the Majority World fail to take advantage of them due to several challenges that include the cultural relevance of courses, differences in teaching and learning pedagogy, language barriers, and most tangibly, lack of sufficient telecommunication infrastructure. To address these challenges and maximize the potential of MOOCs for expanding access to higher education, a 2-year pilot program was launched in 2015 in an impoverished area of Nairobi, Kenya to explore a new learning modality combining quality online materials and in-class meetings with learning facilitators. This paper discusses the potential of such a model to scale beyond the initial pilot to make higher education accessible to those with the least access.

AB  - Integration of all engineering related information in a single complex product model is one of the main purposes in computer system based engineering activities. Because engineering process highly depends on product development and application projects, its definition was first realized in product modeling environments at the application of product data management (PDM) systems. However, this administrative solution could not be integrated with the content of product descriptions. As a contribution to efforts for integration of engineering process definitions in product model, work in a recent research project theoretically grounded the definition of engineering process entities and their connections with product model entities. The author of this paper participated at that project and considered practical points of view in order to reveal possibilities for the implementation of the proposed method in industrial product modeling environments. This paper introduces an analysis on the role of product model in engineering process and characteristics of processes for engineering process definition. Following this, it discusses definition, integration, coordination, content, product, and background related resources of engineering process definition in product model.

AB  - Stereotype threat, impostor syndrome, lacking a sense of belonging, and misconceptions about the field are just some of the reasons that contribute to the increasing diversity gap in Computer Science. To address this, our institution has developed an undergraduate course in which students contribute to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects under the guidance of a dedicated mentor. By contributing to FOSS projects, students can: find a mentor or role model; collaborate with, participate in, and contribute to a welcoming and supporting community; and see that they can have real-world positive impact. This paper describes the course and our experiences in teaching it, and provides evidence that it can have a positive impact on diversity by increasing retention and improving students’ confidence.

AB  - Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems, and for testing algorithms through simulations that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to implement. A model has been devised that simulates the sound localization performance of normal hearing persons, and that is being further refined for simulation of performance of hearing-impaired persons wearing two cochlear implants (CIs). The model is intended to be a tool in understanding the relative contribution of various factors involved in acoustic localization, and in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies. This presentation overviews the development of and results for the normal hearing model, and discusses modifications that are needed to simulate sound processing with binaural cochlear implants. The human head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of the model, and provides the characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects. It defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues reaching each ear that are important for good localization ability. The model has been validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization in normal listeners, and is being further developed to account for differences in the signal pathway and sound reaching the CI user due to sound processing and microphone location effects.

AB  - Today digital media such as social networks, chat rooms, and forums have gained much importance in human life for information sharing. Users will share their knowledge and emotions in their own languages. This will create a novel syntax to communicate their messages with as much as pithiness as possible. Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.

AB  - World Wide Web is a dynamic source of information which is expanding its content at a staggering rate. Individual search engines are not able to handle the exponential nature of Web. Hence meta-search engines are used to solve the problem of low web space information coverage rate of individual search engines. A meta-search engine is a kind of search tool that dynamically dispatches user query to the underlying search engines, hence providing parallel access to multiple search engines and then aggregate the results to present single consolidated result list to user. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, MetaFusion, has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines fuzzy AHP with genetic algorithm to get more comprehensive and optimized results. Experimental results shows that relevancy of results returned by MetaFusion is more than several existing research Metasearch engines. The precision of MetaFusion is more when compared with Dogpile and Infospace.

AB  - Integration and adding intelligence are essential objectives in development and application of information systems. An old wish of engineers is to have a highly integrated system for the handling of all necessary information during the entire lifecycle of an industrial product. Development of modeling and simulation based product lifecycle management (PLM) systems grounded the realization of such a system during the first decade of this century. The next step is to fill these systems with content in which practice, skill, experience, and intelligence of engineers are represented at a minimum level for successful understanding of a product model in absence of the humans who defined that content. The authors published some results in this topic area in recent years. In this paper, they describe some new methodological elements in order to achieve better representation capability of their earlier proposed modeling. They characterize intelligence in modeled content, explain indirect method for mapping of knowledge at object definition, and discuss expertise and knowledge sources for product model.

AB  - More and more digital supports are being developed to assist creativity. Some of them are designed to uniquely support specific creative methods, while others target the overall support of the creativity and innovation process. Whatever they might offer, only a few use a systems engineering approach. Generally, they do not formalize the environment or interactions within it. The present study proposes a new formalism for modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will discuss CSS support of the “48h to Generate Ideas®” creativity challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.

Topological plots of time-averaged EEG signals across all the trials corresponding to the imagery of a particular word are fed as input to the designed deep neural network algorithm. Designed deep learning architecture has an amalgamation of the Two-dimensional convolutional neural network and LSTM that takes the assistance of the capabilities and assets of both neural network architectures. The proposed neural network architecture achieves admirable accuracy in identifying imagined words from the EEG-based Kara one dataset. The accuracy of the designed CNN-LSTM model with topological plots as input features was 20-25% more than chance level accuracy and comparable to the state of arts.

Many previous studies and conference presentations have shown that while students do not perform any worse in flipped classrooms than in a traditional format. However, a thoughtful design of the time spent in class can improve performance. This work-in-progress paper is a narrative of one course's journey over several semesters from traditional lecture to flipped classroom, and the observations of the impact that in-class and out of class activities had on overall performance of students. Brief descriptions of many course assignments and activities are included. In addition, the preliminary plan for evaluating how to create an inverted classroom that can support building lifelong learning skills is presente.

Modern teaching methods such as case studies, laboratory experience, visiting real-world scenarios and story-telling are commonly and easily practiced. In this paper we identify the challenges faced by teachers of computer networking in Malaysian polytechnics and study how animated media can be a most valuable tool to use in communicating the abstract and advanced concepts of computer communication to students in this institutions. We discuss some preliminary ideas on the development of animated and interactive media for teaching computer networking and elucidate the benefits of using animated media.

AB  - Many conflicts emanate from failure to understand others’ perspectives. Computationally supported roleplaying games have the potential to promote successful perspective taking. When implemented with the affordances of virtual reality, nuances of embodied communication in roleplaying can be more robustly modeled. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a roleplaying game aimed at simulating ingroup-outgroup biases with the goal of supporting positive perspective taking in virtual reality: On the Plane. The game presents players with a simulation of air travel experience, from airport security screening to in-flight events. On the Plane affords the ability to experience the simulation as different characters, supporting both ingroup and outgroup perspectives. We describe how the game is structured to simulate and challenge ingroupoutgroup biases within the context of xenophobia and lay out our plans for future research using On the Plane to promote positive perspective transformation (e.g., challenging one’s own ill-founded preconceptions).

And an algorithm is proposed to construct cost state space that is used to select web services composition with optimal cost. Case analysis show that PTPA can model both functional aspects and non-functional aspects of services composition.

AB  - Cyberbullying, the act of intentionally causing harm to others through electronic communication, has emerged as a critical societal concern, particularly among university students. With the rapid proliferation of digital technologies, university campuses have become hotspots for cyberbullying incidents, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors driving this phenomenon. This paper presents a systematic review that aims to identify and analyze the key factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The conceptual framework that was utilized to pinpoint the factors influencing university students' cyberbullying behaviours was examined in this study. According to a systematic screening of recent research articles (from 2013 to 2023) pertaining to online bullying behaviours among university students, the findings were given. After evaluating theoretical models and associated concepts, we suggest using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to evaluate factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The findings of this study are discussed, and it is concluded that subjective norms, attitude, perceived behavioural control, social media use, and intentions all have the ability to influence university students' cyberbullying behaviours.

AB  - 3D printing is a contemporary method of three-dimensional objects’ production. Prior to the printing, the object must be designed in the form of its 3D model - a virtual spatial body. The model is then transferred into a computer program which will control the printing process. Finally, the object is composed using a stepwise addition of micro-particles (grains).3D printing is very appropriate for the individualized production i.e. for fabricating unique objects or those done in small series. A typical lifecycle of these objects is "Design it – Produce it – Make use of it". A growing interest in this extent of production requires preparing enough 3D-printing specialists in a variety disciplines. In our presentation, we discuss what professionals are needed and what modifications of contemporary schooling would fulfil these requirements to a maximum degree.

AB  - Mobile learning is an inevitable result of technological progress, which is achieved through networks. Compared to traditional learning modes, using mobile phones for learning is not limited by geography or learning forms, and has great freedom in time and space. This is an informal remote teaching based on digitization and mobile computer devices. Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning. Based on the above issues, this article discussed how to build a mobile assisted language translation intelligent recommendation system using NPL (Natural Language Processing) technology. Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model. The experiment verified the superiority of the mobile assisted language translation system based on NPL.

AB  - In this study, we discuss a virtual agent's acquisition of orientational concepts based on physical experience. A virtual agent moves in a computer's virtual space under restrictions similar to that in the real world. We use a genetic algorithm to simulate and evolve the agent. We then discuss an orientational metaphor that has a basis in physical experience, and we attempt to retrieve clues for solving the generation of concepts by simulating concrete examples, for example, by detecting objects that build a pattern of leg locomotion to approach the object. The pattern is an insignificant set of weight matrices; however, this pattern is grounded in the environment and the body. We then discuss what is represented in the agent action by using the simulation results. In addition, we mention the construction of concepts, such as the GOOD-BAD concept.

AB  - Image captioning stands as a pivotal technique for providing contextual descriptions of visual content, promising substantial enhancement in the capabilities of conversational AI systems. This work delves into the integration of image captioning methodologies into ChatGPT, aiming to fortify its capacity in understanding and responding to visual information. The study extensively explores the application of deep learning models, encompassing ResNet50, LSTM, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2, in the domain of image captioning. Specifically, a comprehensive investigation is conducted into a Recurrent Neural Network employing LSTM as a decoder and a Convolutional Neural Network utilizing ResNet as an encoder. These fusion harnesses vocabulary and image features to craft precise and meaningful descriptions of visual content. Furthermore, this study pioneers an approach to identify and relate at least two salient features within any given image, forming a coherent caption that binds the relationship between these identified features. This novel capability not only refines image captioning techniques but also empowers ChatGPT to comprehend complex visual contexts within conversational settings. The outcomes of this work offer profound insights into augmenting AI capabilities, facilitating a deeper understanding and more effective interaction with visual information across various domains, thereby advancing the field of conversational AI integration with visual context.

AB  - Music learning is important for preschool children’s musical development, but preschool children are considered to have limited cognitive development and have difficulties understanding abstract musical concepts. Tangible interaction can introduce physical entities into the interaction, allowing children to use their daily life experiences to interact with the computer, reducing the cognitive load and therefore improving the effectiveness of music learning. Combining the cognitive characteristics and physical ability level of preschool children, a design model of a music learning system for preschool children based on tangible interaction is constructed with reference to existing research models, and a set of design recommendations based on this model is proposed. This paper also designs and develops an interactive prototype Music Magician for preschool children to learn music and completes the construction of an interactive action library and iteration of the prototype after pre-experiment feedback. The validity of the prototype is verified through experiments, and the rationality of the proposed design model and design recommendations is also validated.

AB  - In research aimed at determining the level of interest of high school students in enrolling in colleges, predictive analysis models and comparisons are rarely applied during the classification and processing of various data. All of this leads to significant fluctuations in college admissions, where certain schools are unable to admit a large number of students who show interest in a specific field. On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields. The goal of this paper is to use programming language classifiers to predict student enrollments in colleges based on the results students demonstrate during regular attendance in high schools through participation in innovation fairs.

AB  - The South African government continuously strives to work on the development of legislations that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its citizen's information in the digital space. The contagion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) led to a global lockdown that put governments in emergency mode. Post-COVID-19, the benefits of digitization became more noticeable. During the lockdown era cloud computing proved its effectiveness and efficiency in helping employees continue working even outside of their workstations. The objective of this paper is to scrutinize the current state of cloud data protection in the public sector within South Africa. The emphasis is placed on the draft National policy for cloud and data storage. This paper also makes recommendations to further strengthen and improve the current state of South Africa's cloud and data storage. It goes further to review existing legislations such as POPI, ECT, and cyber law acts and their relevance to the draft National Data and Cloud Policy. A proposal for a model that incorporates the cloud-shared responsibility model is presented and briefly discussed.

The development and the technical solutions bring about technical challenges, but the situations one is confronted with, may also be sociological, psychological or managerial in nature. Without any knowledge in the field of social sciences, the programmers, testers and managers might interpret the social aspects of the project improperly, and such interpretations lead to the inability to fully understand the problem and, ultimately, to inefficiency in the decision-making process. Furthermore, solid knowledge of theories in the area of the social sciences is required for a better understanding of both the context in which the application runs and of the final users who will use the developed project. The understanding of and the involvement in a software acceptance testing (SAT) project, requires the combination of multiple theories and principles from different disciplines.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.

AB  - The impact of new technology on higher vocational education(HVE) has attracted the attention of many domestic scholars. The current direction of education informatization research is mostly smart classrooms. Therefore, schools will inevitably promote education informatization through the use of smart classrooms, and smart classrooms with classroom teaching(CT), teacher-student activities, and Internet + education will also become the core. This article uses experimental analysis and questionnaire survey methods to experiment on the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE, compare and analyze the learning effects of the experimental and control classes of computer professional courses, and investigate and analyze their attitudes to the application of the intelligent classroom model. The experimental survey results show that the outstanding students in the experimental class has more students than that in the control class, and the learning effect is better than the traditional mode in the smart CT mode of deep learning, and most students in the experimental class prefer the use of the smart classroom mode. It can be concluded that it is necessary to study the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE. In the intelligent classroom teaching system, data mining, K-means algorithm and MapReduce framework are comprehensively applied. By analyzing various behavioral data of students in school, the potential value behind these data is mined, so as to improve the construction of intelligent classroom and promote the improvement of higher vocational education.

AB  - Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.

AB  - Application analysis of the intelligent computer software online guiding based on VR technology is presented in this paper. In the VR design optimization, the proposed research work have designed a mechanism by including address semantic encoding and data stream classification; a mechanism for establishing core service function chain path based on source routing technology; a dynamic optimization model of the service function chain under multiple resource constraints. In the application stage, the computer software structure optimization model and the sensitive data testing model are applied. The fuzzy analysis and the robustness testing is applied to show the performance.
