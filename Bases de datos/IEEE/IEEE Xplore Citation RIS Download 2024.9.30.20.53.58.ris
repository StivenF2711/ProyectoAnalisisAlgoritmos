AB  - Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.

AB  - Software applications are designed with a concrete purpose in mind, specified by business owners basing on the individual requirements. The user-system interaction is specified in the analysis phase. This phase specifies inputs, outputs, interaction etc. These elements could be specified separately based on the target platform. The designers know that the mobile clients could have a different application flow than desktop clients. However, this is not a rule and designers often times do not think about the user context nor do they consider the application context. This implies that outputs, inputs and interactions do not change automatically during the software life cycle. In this paper we present techniques that are able to determine whether the user, which is in a particular context, should be required to spend his/her time to fill in fields that are not needed for accomplishing a specific business task. Moreover, these techniques are able to determine whether the fields should display or are not necessary, as well as how the system might interact with the user. Finally, we present a computational architecture that is able to make these types of determinations.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Human brain is a learning system. Human have to learn by getting exposed to something. This capability of learning system to recognize new patterns is called generalization. The abilities of human brain to perform generalization are yet to be matched by neural network or even by any of artificial intelligence algorithm in general. Thus, the need for new machine intelligence approach is imperative. Neural network is designed to take advantages of the speed of computers to solve engineering and computational complex problems intelligently. On the other hand, human brain is somewhat not computationally powerful. Human brain is not even able to calculate quadratic problems within milliseconds. Instead, it uses its vast amounts of memory to store everything human know and have learned. According to a modern neuroscience theory named memory-prediction framework, introduced by Hawkins and Blakeslee in 2005, human brain uses this memory-based model to make continuous predictions of future events. Therefore, a hybrid approach that possesses the ability to compute like neural network and at the same time think like human brain will shed some light in the advancement of machine learning research as well as the development of a truly intelligent machine. This talk discusses the memory-prediction framework and proposes simplified single cell assembled sequential hierarchical memory (s-SCASHM) model instead of hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) in order to speed up the learning convergence. s-SCASHM consists of single neuronal cell (SNC) model and simplified sequential hierarchical superset (SHS) platform. The SHS platform is designed by simplifying to have a region with four rows columnar architecture instead of having six rows per region as in human neocortex. Then, the s-SCASHM is implemented as the prediction engine of user behavior analysis tool to detect insider attacks/anomalies. As nearly half of incidents in enterprise security triggered by the Insider, it is important to deploy more intelligent defense system to assist the enterprise be able to pinpoint and resolve any incidents caused by the Insider or malicious software (malware). The attacks evolve; however, current detection systems that use the deep learning techniques cannot perform online (on-the-fly) learning. Thus, an intelligent detection system with on-the-fly learning capability is required. Experimental results show that the proposed memory model is able to predict user behavior traffic with significant level of accuracy and performs on-the-fly learning.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this paper is to present preliminary work on the development of an EduChatBot tool and the measurement of the effects of its use aimed at providing effective feedback to programming course students. This bot, hereinafter referred to as tutorBot+, was constructed based on chatGPT3.5 and is tasked with assisting and providing timely positive feedback to students in computer science programming courses at UCSC. Methods/Analysis: The proposed method consists of four stages: (1) Immersion in the feedback and Large Language Models (LLMs) topic; (2) Development of tutorBot+ prototypes in both non-conversational and conversational versions; (3) Experiment design; and (4) Intervention and evaluation. The first stage involves a literature review on feedback and learning, the use of intelligent tutors in the educational context, as well as the topics of LLMs and chatGPT. The second and third stages detail the development of tutorBot+ in its two versions, and the final stage lays the foundation for a quasi-experimental study involving students in the curriculum activities of Programming Workshop and Database Workshop, focusing on learning outcomes related to the development of computational thinking skills, and facilitating the use and measurement of the tool’s effects. Findings: The preliminary results of this work are promising, as two functional prototypes of tutorBot+ have been developed for both the non-conversational and conversational versions. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration into the possibility of creating a domain-specific model based on pretrained models for programming, integrating tutorBot+ with other platforms, and designing an experiment to measure student performance, motivation, and the tool’s effectiveness.

AB  - Supported by a state grant, our team of researchers (consisting of both Computer Science faculty and Teacher Education faculty) is offering a series of Professional Development sessions to K-8 teachers. These Professional Development (or PD) sessions are meant to help K-8 teachers develop their understanding of core computing concepts (such as algorithms, programming, data analysis, and networks) and thereby develop strong computer science programs for their students. In order to offer effective and meaningful Professional Development (PD) sessions, our research team first intended to understand the perceptions and experiences of K-8 teachers about Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) education. This paper presents the results of a K-8 teacher survey that we conducted as a pre-cursor to our PD series. The results of this survey provided valuable insights about elementary and middle-school teachers' perceptions of computer science education, self-perception of their ability to teach and learn CS, and understanding of CS discipline and those who typically engage in CS activities. The impact of teachers' perceptions impact how leaders in education and the CS industry can meet the needs of teachers, who in turn can meet the growing demand of CS education in K-8 schools.

AB  - The orientation of an ocean-bottom-seismometer (OBS) is a critical parameter for analysing three-component seismograms, but it is difficult to estimate because of the uncontrollable OBS posture after its deployment. In this study, we develop a new and effective method to estimate the OBS orientation by fitting the amplitude of direct P wave of teleseismic receiver functions. The reliability of this method is verified using synthetic data and observed waveforms recorded at land seismic stations in Shandong Province, China. Our extensive synthetic tests show that our new method is little affected by a thin sedimentary layer that has a low S-wave velocity. The orientations of OBS stations that we deployed in the Yap subduction zone in the Western Pacific Ocean are estimated and corrected using our new method. After the correction, the direct P waves of teleseismic receiver functions show very good consistency. The effects of white and coloured noise in different levels, epicentral distance and backazimuth are also investigated, and the results show that these factors have small effects on the new method. We also examine the effect of sensor tilting on estimation of the OBS orientation, and find that a tilting correction should be made before the misorientation correction. We compare the OBS orientations determined with the new method and other methods and find that they are generally consistent with each other. We also discuss advantages and shortcomings of various methods, and think that our new method is more robust than the existing methods.

AB  - The rapid growing application of language models (LLMs) in education offers exciting prospects for personalized learning and interactive experiences. However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of "hallucinations," where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education.

AB  - Film-based cameras were replaced with digital cameras in a very short period. Saving film costs for each shot is not only of advantage of this transition. The more important advantage by this digitization is that forming optically a completed image on detector is not necessary and acquired data are processable by a computer. We can think that, with optional optical system-lens array-, acquired data can be nuggets of information which contains both image and its depth or bunch of incident rays which are equal value to actual 3-D scene. These data represent 3-D situations and by computing them, various optical effect, e.g. focusing and changing field of depth, can also be realized or simulated virtually. My issue is to clarify how 3-D scene is transformed and expressed on 2-D detector and how this 2-D information is retrieved back again into 3-D scene through lens array and other optical devices. Light-field optics or lens array is one of those exchangeable methods of the transformation between actual 3-D scene and information encoded on 2-D plane. Recently new method for lens array was introduced; a circular zone plate instead of lens array. As for a 3-D Display which consists of flat display and lens array, the encoded data shown on a flat display and they are retrieved into real 3-D image by a lens-array. I will mention not only its advantage but its limitation of ability for 3-D image reconstruction.

The BOPPPS model is a popular student-centered teaching mode at home and abroad in recent years, which emphasizes the participation of students and timely teaching feedback. In order to explore an effective teaching mode, this paper designs a recursive algorithm teaching design method combined with boppps model, which can effectively improve the participation of students and improve the quality of teaching.

By summarizing and analyzing the approaches for utilizing the same kind of information, this paper finds that lexical information is mainly analyzed based on text and dictionary similarity. Similarly, structural information and semantic information are mainly analyzed based on graph structure and reasoner, respectively. The approaches for aggregating information analysis results are discussed. Challenges in the analysis of various types of information for existing ontology matching solutions are also described, and insights into directions for future research are provided.

AB  - With the prime objective of understanding the direction in which the field of big data is heading, this paper emphasizes on the recent and upcoming trends in big data. The human brain handles big data in all its forms very efficiently and almost instantaneously, no matter what is the granularity of the data. The idea behind the field of processing big data is to mimic the manner in which the natural brain works and handles big data. All the fields and subfields of machine intelligence are based on identifying and mimicking the natural methods which are used by mother nature to handle big data. The current trends are mainly moving towards processing big data using the cloud infrastructure and machine learning techniques. By and large the intention of artificial intelligence lies in developing a humanoid robot which can work, talk and think like a human being. The future trends of big data are being applied to such techniques as microprocessors processing big data in a robot’s-brain to plan its actions, express emotions and ultimately to think like a human being.

AB  - Product definition in space where objects are represented in a single contextual model brought a new thinking in work of engineers. This thinking is around the intended interaction with processes those are available for handling of objects in product modeling. Engineer defines a contribution to modify a product model development of which is result of contributions from various fields of engineering. Essential question is that what level results of human thinking process on objects can be applied as input at the model development. The answer depends on communication and representation capabilities of modeling procedures. This paper introduces a new definition of human interaction levels from the lowest to a proposed high level allowing input also on lower level if necessary. Increasing the level is the way towards intelligent product definition procedures. The proposed high level method realizes communication of awaited product characteristics and features together with methods those are assigned to fulfill these product characteristics and features. This paper is a new contribution to the earlier published coordinated request based product modeling (CRPM) methodology.

AB  - Computers are man-made machines which work according to the given set of inputs and perform some operation on the input to generate a new set of outputs. They can be programmed to perform huge and complex task yet they lack imagination and ability to understand things. On the hand human brain is a machine which can learn new tasks by process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and the senses. To make computer work or think like human, human brain modeling of machine is necessary. We need to know how human brain works. The basic component of human brain is neuron, which make us think and do smart things. Brains have billions of neurons and they communicate with each other using electrical impulse. These impulses are responsible for making brain think and to have a consciousness. This paper proposes such a model of a part of the brain.

AB  - Implementing the human way of thinking in different systems is still an open issue in artificial intelligence. Part of this thinking is also the so-called associative reasoning, which is based on associations arising mainly from the simultaneous observations of individual concepts representing our world. These observations can take both the form of images and simultaneous perceptions through other human senses (e.g., sound perceptions). This paper focuses on how to represent these perceptions and their sequence and ways to implement associative reasoning based on them. A data model enabling this functionality on large volumes of data will be presented, as well as the results of experiments on it.

AB  - System Theories, analysis and design have been deployed within every corporate function and within a broad section of businesses and markets. Systems thinking involve changing paradigms about the way the world works, the way corporations function, and the human role in each. In systems thinking, analysis and design we look for interrelationships among the elements of a system. System engineering technology involves the interactions of science, an organization, and its environment as well as the information and knowledge bases that support each. The purpose of systems engineering is to support organizations that desire improved performance. Software Process Simulation is directly linked to software process improvement. Organizations can use software process simulation at all levels of maturity to obtain significant benefits. The aim is to determine how to usefully model a teaching-learning system for a specific course taught to a fresh graduate, and use simulation and modeling to predict consequences of changes to the process.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has developed at a superlative rate, accompanying requests spanning various fields. This research investigates the experience of strength data, exceptionally the request of machine learning (ML) algorithms to a Body Mass Index (BMI) dataset. The basic aim of searching out unwinds the dossier’s many linkages and patterns, eventually chief to more thorough information of the variables deciding BMI. The study starts accompanying an initiation to the subject within reach, understood by a thorough study of appropriate work, a complex mechanics division, and an itemized reason of the reached results. However, because of advances in Machine Learning, we immediately have the talent to handle this issue in a more excellent manner. We’ve built an advance dossier-study system that can think a patient has diabetes, a suggestion of correction, admitting for early mediation. This predicting plan uses dossier analysis methods to extractable intuitions from a big number of diabetes-accompanying facts. Its basic aim is to correctly determine a patient’s risk of diabetes. We’ve working categorization plans to a degree Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to cultivate the model. These outcomes show the influence of the subsystems in thinking diabetes risk admit a large size of veracity. This predictive finish can create a meaningful dissimilarity in labeling at-risk things early and providing bureaucracy with essential care and counseling before the ailment progresses. In summary, our machine intelligence-located scheme offers a natural still strong solution to call the risk of diabetes in subjects. By controlling the wherewithal of dossier reasoning and categorization algorithms, we can enhance early discovery and deterrent measures for this weighty affliction, eventually reconstructing patient consequences and reducing the burden of BMI-related complications.

AB  - The last few decades proves to be an era of booming communication and information disciplines, bringing about profound influence on people's life and every socio-economic sector. In this dramatically changed world, it is being found that many of the systems engineering principles and business practices that some industries have purposely pursued no longer function effectively in a System of Systems environment. This paper is inspired by the embedded, “system of systems (SoS) thinking” in the context of military programming. The purpose of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for a smart tourism industry information system in responding to competitive challenges. The approach here is to illustrate how this SoS thinking and corresponding SoS engineering (SoSE) may be applied through the top-level design for the smart system. For designing a policy maker-responsive, informative system, an emerging complex spatial information approach, geographical simulation, is introduced. This holistic means includes: 1) simulation of the tourism SoS' architecture and evolution process through cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) techniques, based on remote sensing data and GIS instrument; 2) illustration of the mechanism of industrial evolution by scale-free network analysis and social influence network with dynamic Bayesian network theory. This paper calls for a particular attention of communication specialists to concern the forefront of information (esp. spatial information) and systems engineering disciplines.

AB  - System thinking refers to the interrelationship between the parts of the organization that intend to design, produce and distribute products or services. System thinking is actually a conceptual language that encourages professionals into using “feedback loop" thinking rather than mere linear thinking. To solve a problem, systems thinking requires the building of a model by a diverse group with a varied input. The group modeling process which is an important process of system dynamics intervention in organizations is mainly developed by researchers from similar backgrounds and cultures. A research conducted in Israel, a country with a mixture of cultures and social backgrounds, evokes a different experience and approach to the more known group model building techniques. Since the participants in the group were from diverse backgrounds in terms of their culture, economic situation and their work position, they could easily be led by their social condition in their thinking and opinions. Therefore, knowledge elicitation through the group model building process during the group sessions and on the other hand, knowledge elicitation through personal conversation brought up contradictory information and called for constantly improving the elicitation process.

AB  - People are anxious about the potential dangers of scuba diving and like in all sports, there are dangers involved in it. Typically, people think sharks and shark attacks are the dangers of scuba diving, as sharks are one of the ocean's biggest predators, and the great white shark, in particular, is one of the primary threats to divers. The study proposes a deep learning approach to shark detection for underwater diving surveillance. A large collection of great white sharks' datasets underwater is used by the system for training as sharks are hard to differentiate from other sharks like animals in an underwater environment. A YOLOv3 algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection, multiscale prediction, and bounding box prediction through the use of logistic regression is used in the study. And with this approach, the testing of the shark detection system generates a good result.

In 2009, eBay stockpiling added up to eight petabytes (think about 104 years of HD-TV feature). After two years, the Yahoo distribution center totalled 170 petabytes1 (8.5 seasons of all hard circle drives made in 1995)2. Since the ascent of digitisation, undertakings from different verticals have amassed thriving measures of advanced information, catching trillions of bytes of data about their clients, suppliers and operations. Information volume is likewise developing exponentially because of the blast of machine-created (information records, web-log documents, sensor information) and from developing human engagement inside of the interpersonal organizations. So for handling this huge amount of data is really a big challenge, so it turns towards the concept of big data. This paper try to cover major aspects of big data is discussed in II Important Aspect's in Big Data along with its costing issues. The issues in transformation of traditional database into big data is discussed in III important points in transition from traditional data base to big data.

AB  - To reconstruct the shape of wing structure using fiber Bragg grating sensors, an implementation method was presented in this paper. First, the principle of curvature measurement based upon fiber Bragg grating sensor was introduced, and the design of the layout of sensor's locations was optimized by the finite element (FE) analysis of the experimental model. Then, the algorithm description of surface reconstruction was given in detail. Finally, an experiment setup was built using an epoxy resin trapezoid plate equipped with distributed FBG sensors, combined with a data acquisition and a shape reconstruction algorithm system. Afterwards, the experiments of steady deformation and dynamic vibration behavior were implemented for the real-time shape reconstruction of wing model structure. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented method of deformation shape detection for a sort of wing model structure based on fiber Bragg grating sensor array, and indicate that the proposed method can provide useful research thinking for the further study of active monitoring for aerospace wing structures.

AB  - The events of recent years have shed new light on the crisis and change management practices of economic actors. It has been a truism that actors who are more receptive to change can be more successful and efficient than their peers in business markets. Perhaps the most significant changes in recent years have confirmed this even more. One only has to think of the impact of pandemic COVID-19, the energy crisis or the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. In a very short period of time, these events have brought about very significant changes and their impact has been largely negative for most economic actors. If it has not been sufficiently understood so far why it can be important to adapt to changes in a timely and appropriate way, or why good crisis management practices can be important, perhaps everyone will now. Meanwhile, other trends are shaping the global economy and will have an impact on the future state of the economy and society. Examples include sustainability (or the green transition) and digitalisation. Two global changes that will certainly have a long-term impact on society and business processes. No one can afford the luxury of ignoring these changes. What is more, the most competitive economic players are seeking to turn them to their advantage and to reap the benefits of sustainability or digitalisation. It is clear that our world has become faster and more complex than ever before. More and more things are changing around us, with ever more intense consequences. We need to recognise in time how we can respond to changing environmental conditions or circumstances. This is the subject of the present paper, which, after a brief literature review, draws on research findings to illustrate the importance and relevance of digitalisation.

AB  - Universities are institutions that educate and generate labor candidates; as a result, the process of selecting new university students should pay attention to several matters and these matters should be considered. Many universities in the process base the selection on the academic skills and consequently problems will appear when an individual should evaluate all the job criteria as he or she enters employment. Through this paper the researchers would like to propose a model, AHP-TOPSIS, for the process of selecting new university students and for predicting their future employment. With the sample of 30 students from Diploma 3 Aeronautics STTA Yogyakarta, an evaluation model was designed using the indicators of academic skills, English proficiency skills, psycho test, soft skills (communication, problem solving and critical thinking, time management, cooperation, and adaptation skills), and attitudes. The load for these indicators were attained using the AHP and then these indicators would be calculated using the TOPSIS in order to find the alternative rank of the students' selection. The rank was determined by gathering the interest score from the calculation using the AHP so that the integrated evaluation results could be provided. The main objective of this paper was assisting the decision-makers in the process of selecting new university students who have both academic and personality skills that would be necessary to support their performance in the future employment.

AB  - In this work, we are integrating thermal aware design approach in energy efficient Vedic multiplier on FPGA. In the beginning of this universe, Veda describes heat receiving from the Sun god as Suryamrit (Surya i.e. Sun +Amrit i.e. Nectar= Suryamrit i.e. Nectar coming from the Sun God). Now, whole world is feeling anxious about temperature. How our thinking pattern is changing with evolution of mankind? This paper deals with that question and the whole work is going in direction to get solution of this problem with mechanism of ambient (room) temperature scaling and energy efficient LVCMOS I/O standard. LVCMOS is an acronym for low voltage complementary metal oxide semiconductor. In this Vedic multiplier, we are using three LVCMOS I/O standard. LVCMOS12 is available only in 65nm and 40nm FPGA. Rest LVCMOS18 and LVCMOS25 is available among 40nm, 65nm and 90nm FPGA. In order to test the thermal sustainability of our Vedic multiplier, we are testing it in three different room temperature 20°C, 30°C, and 40°C. Using LVCMOS25, there is 12.99%, 19.23% and 10.28% reduction in power dissipation on 90nm, 65nm and 40nm respectively. For LVCMOS25, when our Vedic multiplier design is migrated from 40nm design to 90nm design, there is 87.72% reduction in power dissipation of Vedic multiplier when temperature is constant 20°C.

Consequently, Power Spectral Density techniques and specific algorithm were employed to further enhance the EEG signals. The correlation between the left and the right brainwaves were achieved using paired T test from SPSS. The results, which are brainwave balancing index (BBI) and brainwave dominance, were presented via Graphic User Interface (GUI). The outcome shows that BBI system could be established using EEG signals. These findings (brainwave dominance and BBI) could be used as a straightforward indicator of one's ability to think and work leading to vast opportunity for constructive human potential advancement.

AB  - ICT readiness is not an issue any more-or so we think. In the 21st century, when the industry and society are infused with IT one would reason the more the better, because there cannot possibly be anyone to detest, or stand up against automatization and IT. However, it is not so. Not only the elderly people, who were born before the 2nd world war, but even GenZ people can be afraid of the speed and scope of ICT and modern technology taking over territories of their lives [1]. Of course, there is a substantial part of people who are eagerly looking forward the future fully automatized, and there are others, who simply don't care. But there is a significant group of people, who are not prepared for automatization, who simply do not trust robots and autonomous systems in their lives. Present paper endeavours to approach the notion of ICT readiness from the social, psychological point of view, utilising the framework of the principal-agent theory.

AB  - In this paper, a modified method for landslide prediction is presented. This method is based on the back propagation neural network(BPNN), and we use the combination of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the weights and biases of the network. The improved BPNN modeling can work out the complex nonlinear relation by learning model and using the present data. This paper demonstrates that the revised BPNN modeling can be used to predict and calculate landslide deformation, quicken the learning speed of network and improve the predicting precision. Applying this thinking and method into research of some landslide in the Three Gorges reservoir, the validity and practical value of this model can be demonstrated. And it also shows that the dynamic prediction of landslide deformation is very crucial.

AB  - Recently, a novel form of web services had seen the light under the name of Cloud Computing which presents the dematerialisation of software, systems and infrastructures. However, in a world where digital information is everywhere, finding the desired information has become a crucial problem. In other hand, the users of cloud services starting asking about their privacy protection, particularly when they lose control of their data during the treatment and even some of them think about counting the service providers themselves as honest attackers. For that, new approaches had been published in every axis of the privacy preserving domain. One of these axis consists of a special retrieval models which allow both finding and hiding sensitive desired information at the same time. The substance of our work is a new system of private information retrieval protocol (PIR) composed of four steps the authentication to ensure the identification of authorised users. The encryption of stored documents by the server using the boosting algorithm based on the life of bees and multi-filter cryptosystems. The information retrieval step using a combination of distances by social bees where a document must pass through three dams controlled with three types of worker bees, the bee queen represents the query and the hive represents the class of relevant documents. Finally, a visualization step that permits the presentation of the results in graphical format understandable by humans as a 3D cube. Our objectives is to amend the response to users' demands.

AB  - Railways provide the cheapest and most convenient mode of passenger transport both for long distance and suburban traffic. Also, most of transport in India is being carried out by railway network. Still accidents are the major concern in terms of railway track crossing and unidentified crack in rail tracks in Indian railway. About 60% accidents are occurring at railway track crossing and due to crack in railway tracks resulting in loss of precious life and loss of economy. Therefore there is need to think about new technology which is robust, efficient and stable for both automatic gate closure system and crack detection in railway track. This paper proposes an unmanned gate crossing and faulty rail track detection. Unmanned level crossing is a IR sensors base system and crack detection is an dynamic approach which combines the use of GPS (global positioning system) tracking system and GSM (global system for mobile communication) modem to send geographical coordinate of location. Unmanned gate crossing controller system prevents accident which are caused due to railway track crossing and railway crack detection system prevents train derailment by detecting crack in railway track using internet of things technology.

AB  - In eastern Europe, in the last few years the IT services industry has significantly grown due to the externalization of IT operations from western Europe and America: production plants, communications, satellites, etc. In this context the pressure on the eastern IT services labor market has increased. IT services companies employed students with no IT background and trained them in their in house academies in order to respond fast to their contractual obligations. The time frame to form IT operations specialists is very narrow so they need to think of new strategies to speedup their training. In this sense auto-generative learning objects as the second generation of learning objects are a potential solution since it allows autonomous learning anytime during the day, when queuing, in the subway or during school or job breaks. Learners are trained with automatically generated dynamic content, get automatic evaluation of their responses and receive dynamic feedback. Thus, they can exercise autonomously different learning situations benefiting from automatic evaluation.

Additionally talk about the points of interest and impediments of a convention and think about them. Wireless sensor networks are appealing to specialists because of their extensive variety of use potential in ranges, for example, target identification and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and strategic frameworks. On the other hand, lower sensing ranges result in dense networks, which bring the need to accomplish a proficient medium access protocol subject to power imperatives. The IPv6 directing convention for low-power and lossy systems (RPL) has been as of late standardized by the Engineering Task Force (IETF) steering convention for low-control and Lossy networks (ROLL) working social event to bolster IPv6 directing for asset compelled contraptions in the present day, home, additionally, metropolitan situations. Regardless, a couple studies have created the impression that RPL may experience low delivery rates, especially in extensive scale organizations. This paper gives an in-depth examination of the protocol attributes and outline decisions that create such lack of quality issues. In proposed work, we perform data compression and trust calculation which will reduce data sending time and also improves lossless data transmission.

AB  - The traditional way of thinking in controller design prefers the use of the “state space representation” introduced by R. Kalman in the early sixties of the past century. This system description is in close relationship with linear or at least partly linear system in which the linear part can be used in forming a quadratic Lyapunov function in the stability proof. In the standard model of such systems it is assumed that the state of the system is not directly observable, only certain linear functions of the state variable are directly measurable. Since such approaches introduce certain feedback gains for the state variable, observers are needed that calculate the estimation of the state variable on the basis of directly measurable quantities. The Luenberger observers solve this task via introducing a differential equation for the estimated state. In order to avoid the mathematical difficulties of Lyapunov's “direct method” the “Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)” were introduced in a novel adaptive technique that instead of the state space representation directly utilized the available approximate model of the system to estimate its “response function”. In this approach it was assumed that the system's response is directly observable and an iterative sequence was generated by the use of “Banach's Fixed Point Theorem” that converged to an appropriate deformation of the rough initial model to obtain precise trajectory tracking. In the present paper it is shown that the Luenberger observers and the RFPT-based mathod can be combined in a more conventional approach of the adaptive controllers that are designed on the basis of finding appropriate feedback gains. Illustrative simulation examples are presented to substantiate this statement.

The results show that the calculation accuracy by the nonlinear ensemble model of genetic - neural network for wind field is significantly higher than the traditional multiple linear regression model. Thus in practical application the long time sequence data of wind could be calculate according to the short time sequence data of the observation through the ANN nonlinear ensemble model, therefore this model is better practicability and popularize value for it provide the basis to research the exploitation wind resources.

AB  - The proposed project is to design a system to track and locate mobile Alzheimer's disease patients who suffer from lapses of memory and concentration. Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior and is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually make over a number of years. In these circumstances, tracking and locating a patient becomes very essential. In this paper the patient carries a tracking module that when queried from the caregiver, automatically locates itself by a GPS receiver, and then relays this information to the caregiver via GSM. The system is highly useful in tracking the patient's and informing the caregivers regarding their position.

AB  - The Plant Hospitals Maintenance Department maintains the physical environment and provides related services to support medical centers is in reaching their goal of excellence in the delivery of healthcare and public service. Thus, health-care facilities exist to save lives, improve patient health, and reduce pain. Administrators rightly do not consider themselves to be power reliability experts. Yet without emergency power to ensure continuous power to medical equipment, the health-care facility's life-saving mission can be jeopardized, costs can soar, and the profitability of the facility, on which its continued existence depends, can be threatened. With hospitals becoming more electronic, more must be protected by emergency power. Hospital systems increasingly overlap electronically. Well-designed emergency power systems adapt to the changing environment. Emergency power is thus critical and is expensive but if medical center does not have electricity, that's even more expensive. We should think of everything electronic a hospital runs on: security, radiology, cat scans, and operating rooms. And, that's just the big stuff. This paper act as a direct resource for some management plans supporting the environment of Care which should provide a safe, functional, supportive, and effective environment for patients, staff members, and individuals who come to Saudi medical centers facilities. The aims of the survey (this paper) are to: Understand managerial work of the stand by emergency power plant. Determine their most essential functions, roles, skills, challenges and on-job training issues. Identify differences in perceptions and professional practice, based on their qualification and managerial experience. Address maintenance methods of the hospitals emergency power systems, emergencies and electric safety for all members of the hospital community.

The mapping of large spatial data sets is not only of interest for experts anymore but moves into the domain of public applications with regard to the latest advances in web cartography. This creates a need for usable and understandable interactive techniques that allow the visualization and exploration of large spatial data sets. In a series of experiments we look at a variety of technologies aiming at overcoming the obstacle of displaying large spatial datasets in interactive mapping applications. In this short paper we will present our ongoing research on the methods of Marker Clusters, Heat maps and Tiled Heat maps as well as a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluations of the performance of each of these methods. We conclude with what we think should be a new direction for further research in this area.

AB  - When speaking about high speed transfer, generally one thinks of 1-10 Gbps throughput. At the same time in case of a low performance device, 10-20 Mibps is also considered as high speed. The present case discusses the MOD5270 Ethernet module by Netburner Inc. for the 147,5 MHz processor of which it was a challenge to achieve this speed. The plan was to achieve 48 Mibps, however, according to the manufacturer this device is capable of reaching only about half of this speed. This fact was proven over TCP, so only the UDP was able to fulfill the given requirements. In that case the task was to recover the lost packets, therefore our own protocol was developed.

For every transaction, the stored data must be decrypted before applying the updates as well as should be encrypted before permanently storing back at the storage level. By adding this extra functionality to the database, the general thinking denotes that the Database (DB) going to hit some performance overhead at the CPU and storage level. However, The Oracle Corporation has adversely claimed that their latest Oracle DB version 19c TDE feature can provide significant improvement in the optimization of CPU and no overhead at the storage level for data processing. Impressively, it is true. the results of this paper prove too. Most interestingly the results also revealed about highly impacted components in the servers which are not yet disclosed in any of the previous research work.

Combining the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method with gray correlation method and BP neural network method, taking Hei Longjiang Longmay Group as an example, a gas safety evaluation in its five mines was made. The results show that using different integrated comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate the gas safety in the same mine, the results are different. It requires decision-makers to consider many factors and adopt more appropriate and scientific methods when making a comprehensive evaluation, which makes a right decision.

AB  - The Compressed Sensing (CS) framework outperforms the sampling rate limits given by Shannon's theory. This gap is possible since it is assumed that the signal of interest admits a linear decomposition of few vectors in a given sparsifying Basis (Fourier, Wavelet, ...). Unfortunately in realistic operating systems, uncertain knowledge of the CS model is inevitable and must be evaluated. Typically, this uncertainty drastically degrades the estimation performance of sparse-based estimators in the low noise variance regime. In this work, the Off-Grid (OG) and Basis Mismatch (BM) problems are compared in a Bayesian estimation perspective. At first glance, we are tempted to think that these two acronyms stand for the same problem. However, by comparing their Bayesian Cramèr-Rao Bounds (BCRB) for the estimation of a L-sparse amplitude vector based on N measurements, it is shown that the BM problem has a lower BCRB than the OG one in a general context. To go further into the analysis we provide for i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes and in the low noise variance regime an interesting closed-form expression of a normalized 2-norm criterion of the difference of the two BCRB matrices. Based on the analysis of this closed-form expression, we obtain two conclusions. Firstly, the two uncertainty problems cannot be confused for a non-zero mismatch error variance and with finite N and L. Secondly, the two problems turn to be similar for any mismatch error variance in the large system regime, i.e., for N, L → ∞ with constant aspect ratio N/L → ρ.

AB  - China began to research the tertiary oil recovery process from the 1980s. This technology is very mature in the current, but the economic benefits for the EOR project evaluation studies are relatively less and simple, moreover, the evaluation method is single, almost all enterprises have chosen to use net present value method. But net present value method ignores the flexibility which is managed by the decision-makers under uncertainty, not suitable for oil field development investment project evaluation. Real option valuation and strategic decision-making are an important way of thinking, often used in the evaluation of oil exploration, but for oil and gas production, dynamic process of evaluation studies are rarely involved. As the EOR project has the option characteristics, this article will introduce the idea of real options to the EOR project and try to establish the differential equation model of the EOR project evaluation. Differential equations are used for tertiary oil recovery project to analyze the option value.

AB  - Although many clustering algorithms have been proposed so far, seldom was focused on weight of objects. They totally or partially ignore the fact that not all data objects are equally important with respect to the clustering purpose, and that data objects which are close and dense should have more influence to sub-cluster centroid. we think that the similarity or dissimilarity of two objects is not depend on all attributes with special need, some attributes should be use to measure the dissimilarity, others attributes should impact the centroid in other way. A new weighted clustering algorithm call GBWCA is proposed to deal with different objects weight. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use some real and artificial dataset to compare with other algorithm, we present performance comparisons of GBWCA versus k-means and show that GBWCA is consistently superior.

The main part involves utilizing sensors like ECG signal, Temperature, Glucose and heart beat sensors to distinguish a patient's vitals, the second sending information to cloud capacity, and the third conveying the noticed information for ML model like SVM and KNN to anticipate regardless of whether the individual having heart illness or not and then the performance of both the models are compared. The information might be seen from a distance, permitting a specialist or gatekeeper to screen a patient's wellbeing state even while they are not in the emergency clinic. The Web of Things (IoT) has been generally used to interface promptly accessible clinical assets and give patients with insightful, trustworthy, and viable medical care administrations.

AB  - Twitter, a social networking platform allows users to convey their ideas. on a wide range of topics, including politics, sports, the stock market, and entertainment. It has a big influence on how people think. A bot on Twitter sends spam messages. As a result, detecting bots aids in spam detection. In this paper, the detection of twitter bots using Deep Learning methods is addressed. At present, the used models aren't updated with latest datasets and have reduced accuracy and some aren't multilingual. A final classifier, Bot-DenseNet, is built on a dense neural network on combining additional metadata with text encodings. Existing methods consider metadata information or along with some semantic features of text in encoding the user account. It will be trained and then verified using extensive data sets collected from Kaggle and twitter API. Subsequently, comparison between the performance of the Bot-DenseNet and Bag-of-Words model is also analyzed.

AB  - The power system measurement data has high-dimensional features and strong noise, which is difficult to be directly used for intrusion detection. Traditional feature extraction and selection methods take the feature processing as a preprocessing step and perform separately from the model training, which makes the features not well adapted to the model. Therefore, we propose a novel wrapped feature selection framework based on the Las Vegas algorithm, which can improve the detection accuracy by strengthening the coupling between the feature selection and the model training. The Las Vegas algorithm can evaluate a feature subset through a specified model. In this paper, a heuristic thinking is integrated into the Las Vegas algorithm, which greatly improves the search performance of the original method. Finally, the proposed framework is examined on the IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus and 57-bus test systems for two attacks and the experimental results proves the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.

AB  - Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service platform; users can post what they feel and think about to share with others. Although it facilitates users' social behaviour, a high degree of freedom of speech also leads to cyberbullying. The statement released by UNICEF showed that 36.5% of middle and high school students experienced cyberbullying, and 87% observed cyberbullying. Cyberbullying has greatly affected people's daily lives. We conduct this study to detect whether online comments contain cyberbullying behaviours and classify cyberbullying to alleviate this problem. This paper uses an improved information gain algorithm for feature selection, and the bidirectional LSTM neural network is used for classification. On the premise that the information gain threshold is limited to 0.0004, the precision on the test set can reach 95.15%.

AB  - Interaction is a process in which two or more people exchange thoughts and feelings with each other, transmit information and influence both sides. Class interaction refers to the interaction between teachers, students and students in the special environment of classroom. IoT is a network that connects any goods with the Internet through various information sensing devices according to the agreed protocol, and carries out information exchange and communication, so as to realize intelligent identification, positioning, tracking, monitoring and management. Applying the conceptual model and thinking mode of the Internet of Things (IoT) to English Language Teaching (ELT) can also get good results, which leads to the change of ELT mode. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the current IoT technology application process, and expounds the application of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm in university ELT process. The simulation results show that the accuracy of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm is higher than that of traditional algorithm. With the increase of the number of experiments, the accuracy of RETE algorithm is stable at about 95%, and the real-time wavelength tends to be stable. Therefore, applying the IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm to English interactive teaching can make IoT technology play a more active role in ELT in universities and achieve better implementation effect.

AB  - Slow learner is a person who has low level intelligence of thinking skills compared to other people at average age rate. In Malaysia, slow learners have been recognized as students who need special education. The Ministry of Education has created classes for special needs in several schools in order to help them in learning. In class, slow learner students have difficulty in memorizing and understanding a topic especially in mathematics. Using a new technology as educational tools will help them in better understanding of a concept. Implementing educational game applications in learning will help them more focus and enjoy. However, educational games that focus on mathematics for slow learners are rarely found. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop an educational game for primary school slow learners that focus on mathematics. This project implements the ADDIE model for the development of the project. There are five phases including this model which are Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The testing and evaluation had been conducted at school at Temerloh, Pahang involved slow learner’s students and a teacher. The result indicated that the students and teacher give positive feedback and they agree that this application helps the slow learner to get better understanding in mathematics subjects.

AB  - As the community is now a days moving rapidly towards the cloud, its security is something we really need to think and research about. The problem of security is as old as the internet is, and hence a number of solutions for the problem has also been thought of. Many of the various solutions consists using firewalls for the network or in the host, anti-malware programs installed on the system, packet-sniffing techniques for detection of malicious entities as well as fake traffic, pattern and signature matching techniques for various files that the system has to deal with every now and then. One of these is solutions is deploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the network. Here, we have devised a model that will be able to find any unwanted intrusions in the network. For this, we have employed Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm which we will see is an effective algorithm to use. In the first step, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is built using GA with natural selection method. The proposed hybrid algorithm in this scheme is then tested for the detection of malicious network traffic date set.

AB  - Today's era is of the digital images, what we think, imagined is created in the form of digital images. The forgery detection is technique which can detect the cloning from the images. The availability of different images, editing tools have made it easier for a common user to mislead the images and create digital fake images from it. The forgery detection has various techniques like active and passive techniques, moreover the properties like analysis, classification etc, are used to identify the forgery. The work presented in this paper is based on cloning forgery detection. The cloning forgery technique is one of the type of forgery detection techniques in which some area of the image is copied and moved to some another area of the same image which is not easy for the naked eyes to detect easily. The PCA (Principle Component Analysis) technique is used to find the mismatched pixels from the image. In the presented work, the GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) technique is applied with the PCA for the forgery detection. The proposed work is implemented in MATLAB and results are analyzed in terms of PSNR, Recall, Precision and accuracy. In the presented work, the results are better due to less fault rate or able to recover two different attacks (Gaussian noise and motion blur). It is analyzed that the proposed algorithm performs well as compared to the existing algorithm. In existing method the results of their parameters like accuracy were less accurate then proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method achieves more accuracy precession and recall.

AB  - In the New era of technology all system has to be updated, Indian Railway is the 2nd largest Rail Network in India it is the backbone of public and goods transport in India. Bulk of long distance traffic is carried by the Indian Railway. RFID system at many transport system so we think to implement biometrics in our research and then decided to use fingerprint module also for the add-on for user flexibility using GSM module for Communication purpose of sending and receiving message. In our Project Research we are trying to minimize railway Reservation Fraud and give more facility to traveler and improve society. Also simplify the Reservation System in that we will take fingerprint of the person who goes for reservation/ticket booking and help a lot humanitarian by this innovative technology. Standalone module which contains Finger Print Module verify the person's identity. Using GSM before the journey message will be send to the user with information. At time of journey Ticket checker will verify fingerprint with previously stored data using standalone module as a part of verification. By this more number of paper will be saved by that can help Railway in increasing their income by saving cost of paper. No need to carry identity proof. Due to this complicated and bulky reservation and transport system can be corrected.

AB  - Web sites are most effective when they meet both the contents and usability needs of their users. Due to tremendous growth of web application, it increases the complexity of web applications and web navigation. Website design is easy task but, to navigate user efficiently is big challenge, one of the reason is user behavior is keep changing and web developer or designer not think according to user's behavior. Designing well-structured websites to facilitate effective user navigation patterns has long been a challenge in web usage mining with various applications like navigation prediction and improvement of website management. Different methods have been proposed to reorganize Web Pages to improve users navigation using users navigation data but it still causes disorienting users and increases user's cognitive load. There is a need to improve the efficiency and the performance of a website for effective user navigation. Through this Paper we will propose Mathematical programming model to improve user navigation while minimizing alteration to current structure. Optimal solution can be very quickly obtained. We are minimizing unnecessary changes to the present structure of a Web site and hence can be applied for Web site maintenance on a regular basis.

AB  - This paper aims to consider the changes in the international investment environment and bring high uncertainty to multinational enterprises. Therefore, multinational enterprises invest in overseas markets according to the degree of capital expenditure, and adopt progressive investment. The order of capital expenditure (low to high) is divided into four stages, the first stage of export or authorization, and the second stage of opening the franchise chain, the third stage of joint venture, the fourth stage of acquisition or the establishment of foreign branch. Under the uncertainty of investment cash flow and exchange rate changes, use the option to growth or option to abandon of binomial options evaluation method to predict the four-stage cash flow and exchange rate changes. In view of the four stages of multinational enterprises' orderly capital costs (low to high), each stage selects the best decision, uses the option to growth to invest capital or option to abandon to give up the investment. This paper constructs a dynamic and successive investment binomial options decision model, estimates the equity value of overseas investment of multinational enterprises, and conducts investment strategy feasibility assessment. And compare the traditional investment decision NPV method, providing managers with a more flexible decision-making thinking mode for multinational enterprise investment.

In this paper, we propose SPIA influence model, considering actors' both social influence and professional influence. In this way we can choose the most influential actors with no obvious shortcomings. We take Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blogging platform in China, and Douban Movie, the most popular movie community in China, two platforms as background data. We form a graph with their information to combine social and professional influence together, which is the fundamental of SPIA influence model. We try to check the efficiency of SPIA influence model by using of Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient with Forbes celebrity list. After a series of experiments, we think SPIA influence can merge actors' social influence and professional influence well, and help to choose the most influential actors.

In between Transmission and Reception, Information Signal passes through plenty of complex process and stages. We have Implemented, the process made on Chrominance signal (|C|) with the help of simulator, Lab VIEW 9, made by National Instruments in 1986. The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how PAL-D System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is superior then the NTSC system used in American Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.

AB  - Current pandemic situation has a significant impact affecting human life not only socially and economically, but emotionally and psychologically as well. This impact can be easily observed on social media platforms. Along with the knowledge exchange related to Covid-19 pandemic on social media, there is an emotional trauma wave that can be felt by carefully analyzing the activities of this social media. Keeping this view in thought, we analyze around 12000 tweets of Indian people to find out whether there is a trend shift of thinking pattern and mindset of Indian people as the pandemic progresses. The study is bifurcated into stages to clearly see the paradigm shift. We use tweets since twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to its optimum to have a good amount of understanding of the sentiments of the people. Analyzing the twitter dataset, we derive results and find out whether the amount of negative tweets v/s positive (or motivational) tweets have increased or not as the pandemic progresses. The study is supported by graphical visualizations of the polarity of the tweets month wise. Further, Wordmap approach is used to perform qualitative mining analysis in addition to the sentiment score based calculation. This work helps us to understand how the public opinions are changing with the changes in the spread dynamics of the virus. This kind of mood mining helps in identifying the Covid-19 situation from the psychological perspective that whether there is a sense of fear among people or they are quite optimistic of the situation. It can help in a great extend to the strategic and decision making bodies to plan out for future decisions. Further, such kind of studies can be used as reference to provide insights about mental health of people for any future incident or event of such nature.

AB  - There are still many mysteries as to why humans can talk. Especially in birds there is something that can reproduce human's pronunciation. For monkeys as well, it is possible to perform human pronunciation functionally in terms of airway configuration. However, these animals do not have language features. In recent years, research and development of AI which gained a deep impression on deep learning and big data is prevalent. After learning sound, AI can recognize and utter a conversation. Monkeys can see things by eye, recognize them, and eat for food if it is food. AI can cause the robot to take similar actions. Given the mechanism of speech recognition, it is identified as a word unit, a phrase or a sentence by identification of sound, coding of maximum likelihood, and probabilistic syllable estimation using existing databases such as triphones. It can be thought that birds or monkeys can do this sound again through the articulation mechanism. However, it is impossible to freely extract words and phrases from learned sentences, create sentences with new meanings, and pronounce them. Here, I think that the boundary of presence or absence of language is the presence or absence of this function. I'm studying to predict the factors that language has in human beings from the dental field. In the dental field, various information such as the shape of teeth and jaws are accumulated historically and over time. Recent studies have shown that vowels can be pronounced like humans, not humans. However, it is my expectation that consonants, especially fricatives, that adjust the advanced sound with the tongue will probably be difficult. Even children, it is difficult to pronounce fricatives until about 6 years old. I have been conducting research using aerodynamic acoustic techniques to understand why it is difficult to acquire fricative sounds, so I will tell you about things that have been understood so far.

AB  - The deep development of AI urgently needs a unified logic that could describe the whole course of thinking laws as its basic theory. The research goal of flexible logics is to explore the general law of logic. Measure error of flexible propositional truth value affects all the flexible logical operations by affecting the truth value calculation of flexible NOT propositions. In this paper, the general principles of N-Norm in triangle norm theory are introduced. The effect of the generalized self-correlativity to logic NOT operator model in [0,∞) is clarified theoretically by N-norm. Hence we acquire an important element for generating flexible logical operation models - N-generator integrity cluster, which is helpful to find the general rules of the definition of flexible NOT propositional connective in [0,∞) interval. These researches provide the important theoretical base for 1-level operation model in [0,∞) interval in flexible logics.

AB  - T Fake drugs threatens medical supply chain frightfully over 124 countries in the world. Even in Japan, although nobody expected counterfeits violate the maintained distribution of this country, fake harvoni for hepatitis C sold at an authorized pharmacy shocked officials in Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Anti-counterfeit to prevent fake drugs requires rapid-authenticating, costless, and more than anythings, high-security technology. Recent advances in nanotechnology accelerate developments of nanotag identifiers. Thinking of rapidness and high security in authentication, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) produced from well-designed noble metal nanostructure is promised to apply new authentication method. We have developed SERS active nanostructures by self-assembling of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) with Raman active reporting molecules. A few nanogram amounts of the AuNP assembles were directly deposited onto commercial tablet Mucodyne. For on-dose authentication outside of a laboratory, 80 g weight and smart-phone driven palm-top Raman detector was used. Shelf-life in SERS activity of the AuNP self-assemble liquid stocked at room temperature was over six months. The nanotag labeled Mucodyne tablet showed special SERS signal derived from the reporting molecule, and 0.2 s irradiation of 785 nm (5 mW) laser was enough to produce distinguishable SERS spectra from intact tablet. Excellent longevity of SERS signal over three years on the labeled tablets was confirmed. By just 0.2 second laser irradiation with a palmtop Raman spectrometer, rapid on-dose authentication was successfully achieved.

AB  - Television has been a part of our day to day life. So, sometimes we think how this system really works! In between Transmission and Reception, Information Signal passes through plenty of complex process and stages. We have Implemented, the process made on Chrominance signal (|C|) with the help of simulator, Lab VIEW 9, made by National Instruments in 1986. The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how NTSC System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is different from the PAL-D system used in Asian Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.

AB  - Nowadays the uses of electronic circuits, often the opposite trend are seen. To produce a hand are getting cheaper circuits, on the other hand becoming more reliable ones. The first distinction is certainly true in electronic circuits which are used in commercial application, even just thinking of cheap consumer electronics [1] [18] [13] [12] [17]. Another group of electronic circuits made for the high reliability use. This group includes a variety of medical, safety, military technology, aviation and aerospace applications. Reliability of these beyond, are often formulated as special needs, low weight, adaptivity, the reconfigurability, the circuit robustness [6] [4] [7]. In this article we test the different possibilities for such operations the creation of robust circuits, in particular the use of programmable analog circuits.

AB  - Summary form only given. The amount of digital information and the number of digital services are increasing explosively, and being beyond the human ability to use such massive information and services by direct operations on computers/devices. As a user, one may not know exactly what is the most needed, among which is the most suitable, and where is the best place to go in the digitally explosive world. In recent years, autonomic computing, context-aware computing, human-centric computing and so on have been proposed to make computers/devices capable of taking automatic responses according to users' states, preferences, ambient information, etc. Individual-aware computing is a computing paradigm based on the digital clone, called Cyber-Individual or Cyber-I, which is a correspondent of a real individual (Real-I). Cyber-I is far beyond merely a user model or a software agent to assist a user. It is aimed at providing the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of individual's experience, behavior and thinking as well as its birth, growth, and death. Cyber-I enables a Real-I to have a new form of existence in the cyber world and exhibit symbiosis with the Real-I. A Real-I's abilities may be continuously extended with increasing services or applications based on the Cyber-I. Individual-aware computing and Cyber-I are to aggregate multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies as well as a variety of technologies for realizing the harmony of humans, computers, and things.

AB  - For analysis of the reservoir, due to complexity of the reservoir heterogeneity, the relationship between the logging response value and the non-homogenous reservoir is complex and fuzzy. The use of fuzzy clustering method of neural network combines the adaptivity and the fault tolerance of the neural network organic manner with the fuzzy comprehensive discrimination in the human thinking simulation of fuzzy logic, so as to recognize the reservoir heterogeneity through multi-factor fuzzy comprehensive judgment and reasoning. This method has been used to treat the data about the 135 wells in Xujiahe Group in central Sichuan, and has shown good results, with a coincidence rate as high as 87.6%. The result demonstrates that this method enjoys good adaptivity against the problem of automatic recognition of the reservoir heterogeneity, and could improve the precision of automatic recognition of the reservoir heterogeneity.

AB  - Shoulder has a wide range of motion. Contact point between the glenoid and the humeral head, tension of soft tissue, and alignment of muscles connecting the bones drastically change in its range of motion. Mechanism stabilizing shoulder joint is influenced by arm positioning. Assessment of joint stability should always take arm positioning into consideration. In fact, there is a subtle instability which can only be detected when the arm is elevated. The glenoid dysplasia might be a cause for its instability. These findings can be detected only by 3D computer generated images except in some typical cases. Generally, joint stability is judged by location of the humeral head center in the glenoid. More intricate approach is necessary for some disorders. Analysis of contact area and other glenohumeral relation can clarify instability which cannot be detected through investigating location of joint center. The studies using those parameters showed that the joint is inherently unstable with the arm externally rotated at 90 degrees of elevation, and that joint positioning would be more apt to be affected from the cocking to the acceleration phase during throwing activity. We think such instability might lead to throwing disorders.
