AB  - Emotion perception similar to thinking, learning and remembering is consequent of complicated brain processes which are related to specific biological metabolism. Different human's emotional states are recognizable by measuring and interpreting of human physiological signals. Bio-sensors possess a number of advantages against other emotion recognition methods as they are relatively more consistent across cultures and nations. Emotions have a serious effect on driving. Human beings in negative and sometimes positive emotional states can be distracted which will increase the risk of driving. This paper presents an EEG-based emotion recognition system. Mutual information and magnitude squared coherence are applied to investigate the interconnectivity between 8 scalp regions. A study was performed to collect 8 channels of EEG data from 26 healthy right-handed subjects in experiencing 4 emotional states while exposed to audio-visual emotional stimuli. After feature extraction, 5-fold cross-validation was then performed using the KNN and SVM classifier. The results showed existence of different kind of functional brain connectivity in different emotional states.

AB  - As the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research field is relatively young and interdisciplinary, we spend a good deal of time and effort on communicating with each other, sharing ideas and empirical findings across disciplinary boundaries. While this practice is important and needs to continue, there is an increasingly pressing need for us to also communicate outside of this research community. I have met way too many designers, engineers, product managers, and roboticists, who tell me that they were either unaware that there was an HRI research community or that they have found our research community and have been disappointed by our work. That is unfortunate and it is fixable. Like the Human-Computer Interaction research community, we need to tackle this research-practice gap [1]. In this talk, I will make the case for why and how we might get started. There is so much to be gained by taking a Translational Science approach to HRI research. There are opportunities to do work that is grounded in real world problems, real people, and real robots. Furthermore, there are opportunities to make a difference in the design and deployment of robotic products and services right now. As just one example, in spending time studying robot deployments in service industries, at sea, and in the sky, we kept meeting professional Robot Wranglers. In many of our research projects, graduate students take on the Robot Wrangler role, which we claim will eventually disappear when the robots become “fully” autonomous. Looking across many industries, I believe that Robot Wranglers are here to stay. We could and should study them as real stakeholders and people. As HRI researchers, we have an opportunity to use our work to more directly inform the design of technologies. We can also find inspiration from the study of empirical [2]. I think it is time to roll up our sleeves and get better at communicating and working with the people who are building the future of robotics now. Publishing and presenting peer-reviewed papers is not where our work ends. We have much more work to do in translating our work in ways that will help others outside of our research community actually make use of our insights, engaging in collaborations with them, and coming back here to share and learn from stories about those experiences.

AB  - It is important that we analyze walking stability of physically unimpaired persons as one aspect of preventive medicine. There are many cases of unstable walking even if people think they are in good health. It is considered that if they continue to walk unstably, this may cause lower-back pain or knee pain; this burden also exerts bad influences upon other physical parts. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using an acceleration measurement system. Using this system, we measured the acceleration displacement at the COG of a normal walking subject and evaluated walking stability quantitatively. The center of gravity (COG) plays an important role in evaluation of stability for both standing posture and walking. By using the seasonal adjustment model it was possible to predict the periodic fluctuations observed, decomposing the original data into factors representing stability and instability. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using the ratio of the variance of the noise component vs. the variance of periodic component. This study provides useful information for understanding walking systems in preventive medicine and rehabilitative medicine.

AB  - Blockchain as an emergent technology is quickly gaining ground as a decentralised distributed trustless database in the form of a linked-list data structure. This paper discusses the non-deterministic nature of public blockchain consensus protocols and argues that the probabilistic validity of a new block does not provide adequate guarantees of accuracy and integrity which in the case of cryptocurrencies could result in quite substantial asset losses. The contribution this paper adds is to spark a new line of thinking in regards to the validity of data in blockchains.

AB  - In order to study brain function, some researchers have attempted to reverse-engineer neuronal networks and even the brain itself. This approach was based on the assumption that neurons in-vivo acted just like simple transistors in-silico. Unfortunately, both network and whole-brain modeling based on this premise have led to very little insight into actual brain function. The evidence for this claim is two-fold. First, the amount of energy needed to operate computing machinery that isn't anywhere near as complex as the human brain still requires much more energy than the latter. Second, because transistor-based computing reacts to static events whilst neurons can react to processes, properties inherent to computing architectures hardware prevent the true level of complexity and connectivity achieved in the human brain from being realized in-silico. In contrast to transistors, neurons can establish and change their connections and vary their signaling properties according to a variety of rules, allowing them to adapt to circumstances, self-assemble, auto-calibrate and store information by changing their properties according to experience (Laughlin & Sejnowski, 2003). In this speech, we elaborate on this evidence, and argue that there is a need to re-think the way we approach brain computation. In particular, we argue for a detailed understanding of neuronal function and network organization is required prior to neuronal network modeling attempt.

AB  - In the Exa-scale era, one of the most important and tough problems is how to enhance the sustained performance against the limited power budget. Traditional multi-or many-core general CPUs are still popular for easy programming and porting of general applications. However, it is getting to face to the limit by semiconductor technology limit, memory capacity per core, network bandwidth, etc. GPU represents the attached accelerator solution in heterogeneous computing thanks to its high peak performance ratio to power consumption, and moreover, recent progress on AI applications such as TensorFlow ready NVIDIA GPUs. However, GPU's extremely high performance is provided by wide width of data parallel computation both in instruction level and core/thread level which requires thousands of SIMD operations simultaneously executed. Many of success stories on GPU acceleration depend on their simple parallel execution and quite low rate of exception (if statements) handling. Another problem is the interconnection network which relies on CPU-bundle high performance network such as InfiniBand. In our research team has been focusing on the FPGA computation, which is one of the hot topics of new type of accelerators for HPC, however it is quite difficult to achieve a comparable performance with GPU especially for SIMD style applications. So, we think that a new generation of accelerated computing supported by multiple heterogeneous accelerator platform including several types of ones together on computation node. The first target is a combination of GPU and FPGA to provide 360-degree solution with SIMD and pipelined parallelism depending on the characteristics of each computation part of a large application. In this talk, I will introduce the current status of our Multi-Hetero Accelerated System running on University of Tsukuba, its hardware and software development, and real application with preliminary performance evaluation.

AB  - The mechanical behaviors of a composite superconducting strand, which is composed of a variety of materials with different mechanical properties, are difficult to be accurately predicted using traditional mechanical methods due to the complex modeling process and difficulties in dealing with the interactions among different materials as well as material failure. In this paper, a three-dimensional equivalent discrete element model of an NbTi/Cu composite strand is established by twisting process first, and its mechanical response under external load is successfully achieved by introducing different material constitutive relations into contact models discriminatively and taking the filament fracture into consideration. This model can reduce the modeling process largely and acquire more accurate results, which can also provide a new thinking in predicting the mechanical performance of other superconducting strand or composite material.

The framework emphasizes a user-centered design (UCD) approach that takes into account the unique needs and preferences of patients, non-patient users, and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Based on the results of these studies, we analyzed and refined the RA designs and proposed a UCD-based conceptual framework for designing effective and user-friendly healthcare RAs. The paper aims to provide an initial resource for researchers, designers, and developers interested in developing RAs for healthcare contexts by thinking of UCD techniques.

AB  - The concept of a bandgap is so deeply ingrained that it is hard to imagine an integrated circuit built on graphene, whose pristine state is a gapless material with charge carriers obeying the relativistic Dirac spectrum, analogous to light. Entertaining such notion is so appalling that many have proposed to cut graphene into bits and pieces, thinking that size quantization effect would recover a bandgap. Unfortunately, the edges are too disordered and unzipping nanotubes simply unzips more nightmares for device integration engineers. Embracing pristine graphene with its Dirac spectrum therefore appeals as a viable technological option worth careful investigation. Such “all-graphene electronics”, in which graphene is kept pristine and lithographic patterning is performed on the electrostatic gates or substrates instead, is the subject of this talk.

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) is a fascinating paradigm in which all things and objects are connected together, it holds a significant position in fostering intelligent high-level services. However, the future IoT architecture is still under evolution profiting from the overwhelming development of cyberspace and cyber technologies. Based on the traditional physical-based IoT, social-inspired Internet of People (IoP) and brain-abstracted Internet of Thinking (IoTk), an intelligent embryo of cyber-enabled Internet of X (IoX) is being established where all things, entities, people and thinking are interacted seamlessly. In this article, we clearly introduce the cyber-enabled IoX from perspective of both ubiquitous connections and space convergence, and design an architecture with four pillars, namely, things, people, thinking and cyberentities in respective spaces. In addition, we analyze the fundamental issues in IoX development, such as information exploding, link exploding and application exploding from the view of ubiquitous connections, entity exploding and relationship exploding on the basis of space convergence, and service exploding from overall aspects, where potential solutions are discussed at the same time. The intelligent cyber-enabled IoX will be the cornerstone for future techniques and applications, and proves to be the solid foundation for upcoming intelligent and proactive era.

Artificial Intelligence with the help of big data has transformed all industries around the world Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human or animal intelligence in computational systems so that they are programmed to think like Intelligent beings and mimic the actions of intelligent entities. Computational systems which have programmed intelligence can solve different real-world problems far more accurately and efficiently than computational systems that are deterministic and hardcoded. Since many problems in business and business analytics cannot be solved by deterministic systems, AI plays a major role in tackling problems in the business world Machine learning and deep learning which are subsets of the field of AI is widely used to solve and optimize many problems in business such as marketing, credit card fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service, portfolio management, product recommendation according to the needs of customers, insurance underwriting. AI and big data have revolutionized the business world and this paper discusses some AI and big data technologies that are currently being used to accelerate business growth.

AS are advanced intelligent systems and general AI technologies triggered by the transdisciplinary development in intelligence science, system science, brain science, cognitive science, robotics, computational intelligence, and intelligent mathematics. It is recognized that, in a rigorous perspective, the only matured AS is human brains and human collective intelligence. It explains why there was rarely man-made AS in the past half century, because of the theoretical, mathematical, computational, and programming language unreadiness. Therefore, the ultimate goal of AS is to implement a brain-inspired system that may think and behave as a human counterpart in hybrid intelligent systems and general AI implementations. There is no doubt that AS will be increasingly demanded by the intelligence-based industries and societies for cognitive computers, deep machine learning systems, robotics, brain-inspired systems, mission-critical systems, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent appliances.

AB  - In the ever-evolving field of technologies, the emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI), often referred as strong artificial intelligence (AI), stands as a breakthrough in the realm of machine intelligence, promising to witness a new era of capabilities and possibilities. In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.

AB  - This paper presents the conceptualization proposed by Ignacio Matte Blanco of the functioning of conscious and unconscious thinking. In his original view the two ways of thinking are conceived as two distinct logics, “symmetrical” and “asymmetrical” logics. In this study the fundamentals of his concepts are identified and re-elaborated in a more formal way, with the aim of developing an operational and dynamic functional structure that evolves over time and that includes the affective value of objects. On this basis a computational implementation of the conscious-unconscious interaction that employs Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) is put forward. The reason for this choice is that LCS have a structural affinity with the proposed ideas, and in particular they allow to model directly the psychodynamic concept of “internal reality”.

AB  - Emotion recognition involves accurately interpreting human emotions from various sources and modalities, including questionnaires, verbal, and physiological signals. With its broad applications in affective computing, computational creativity, human-robot interactions, and market research, the field has seen a surge in interest in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) techniques developed from 2014 to 2024, encompassing verbal, physiological signals, facial, body gesture, and speech as well as emerging methods like sketches emotion recognition. The review explores various emotion models, distinguishing between emotions, feelings, sentiments, and moods, along with human emotional expression, categorized in both artistic and non-verbal ways. It also discusses the background of automated emotion recognition systems and introduces seven criteria for evaluating modalities alongside a current state analysis of MER, drawn from the human-centric perspective of this field. By selecting the PRISMA guidelines and carefully analyzing 45 selected articles, this review provides comprehensive perspectives into existing studies, datasets, technical approaches, identified gaps, and future directions in MER. It also highlights existing challenges and current applications of the MER.

AB  - We prove that, for all binary-input symmetric memoryless channels, polar codes enable reliable communication at rates within an additive gap  $ \varepsilon > 0$  to the Shannon capacity with a block length, construction complexity, and decoding complexity, all bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . Polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties; previous constructions were not known to achieve capacity with less than  $\exp (1/ \varepsilon )$  decoding complexity except for erasure channels. We establish the capacity-achieving property of polar codes via a direct analysis of the underlying martingale of conditional entropies, without relying on the martingale convergence theorem. This step gives rough polarization (noise levels  $\approx \varepsilon $  for the good channels), which can then be adequately amplified by tracking the decay of the channel Bhattacharyya parameters. Our effective bounds imply that polar codes can have block length (and encoding/decoding complexity) bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . The generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time by algorithmically computing an adequate approximation of the polarization process.

AB  - Non-malleable codes, introduced by Dziembowski et al., encode messages s in a manner, so that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output s or a message that is independent of s. While this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family P of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when I≤I 22αn for some α <; 1, where n is the number of bits in a codeword). In this paper, we study the capacity of non-malleable codes, and establish optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size, answering an open problem from Dziembowski et al. Specifically, We prove that for every family P with IFI I≤I 22αn, there exist non-malleable codes against P with rate arbitrarily close to 1-α [this is achieved with high probability (w.h.p.) by a randomized construction]. We show the existence of families of size exp(nO(1)2αn) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 - α (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). We also show that 1 - α is the best achievable rate for the family of functions, which are only allowed to tamper the first αn bits of the codeword, which is of special interest. As a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword, a model which has received some attention recently) equals 1/2. We also give an efficient Monte Carlo construction of codes of rate close to 1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any fixed c > 0 and family P of size 2nc, in particular tampering functions with, say, cubic size circuits.

AB  - Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.

AB  - This paper proposes a flexible three-dimensional (3D) scanning system based on an active stereo scanner mounted on a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) industrial robot arm. In addition, we reduce the blind area of sensors by adding one more DOF to adjust the convergent angle of the two cameras. This configuration is suitable for scanning items with different sizes, complex shapes, and sophisticated structures due to the flexibility in approaching the object. Then, the research develops a robot-based iterative closest point method for point cloud registration. This 3D reconstruction strategy enhances the accuracy as well as the computational time of the point cloud processing. After that, we conduct several real-world experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed system and algorithm.

AB  - The requirement for reductions in CO2, NOX and noise emissions from aviation have come under great assiduity. The use of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems within aircraft offer potential performance and efficiency improvements, through reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and reduction in noise. This work proposes a novel multidisciplinary simulation tool, capable of determining optimised propulsion system parameters for various measures of merit (MoM), based on preliminary or conceptual aircraft specifications. Overall power, control and drive system which is to be used within the propulsion systems of hybrid and / or all electric aircraft applications can be determined from the simulation tool. Using an initial sizing algorithm to consider aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems, taking power-to-weight ratio (P/W), wing loading (W/S), and hybridisation of power, as inputs to a mission analysis, and performing an optimisation study to determine a MoM, it has been possible to expand on work in this field with the addition of a supplementary branch in the sizing methodology to include a sizing analysis for the components of an aircraft’s electric propulsion system. The designed program enables accurate sizing of powertrain, optimises overall masses, and allows rapid sizing with minimal computational expense.

AB  - The security of computer programs and systems is a very critical issue. With the number of attacks launched on computer networks and software, businesses and IT professionals are taking steps to ensure that their information systems are as secure as possible. However, many programmers do not think about adding security to their programs until their projects are near completion. This is a major mistake because a system is as secure as its weakest link. If security is viewed as an afterthought, it is highly likely that the resulting system will have a large number of vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. One of the reasons programmers overlook adding security to their code is because it is viewed as a complicated or time-consuming process. This paper presents a tool that will help programmers think more about security and add security tactics to their code with ease. We created a model that learns from existing open source projects and documentation using machine learning and text mining techniques. Our tool contains a module that runs in the background to analyze code as the programmer types and offers suggestions of where security could be included. In addition, our tool fetches existing open source implementations of cryptographic algorithms and sample code from repositories to aid programmers in adding security easily to their projects.

AB  - To show the traditional Chinese painting and the spiritual culture of universities, highlight the artistic accumulation and cultural heritage, analyze the value and significance of digitalizing the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting, Qingdao Agricultural University (QAU) is regarded as the research object. The design principles of the digital museum are clarified by understanding the specific user needs, and the 3DS Max is utilized to develop a roaming system for the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU through Unity3d, a Virtual Reality (VR) software platform. Besides, the perspective control, collision detection of virtual characters and scenes, and control of pop-up information display windows are realized to achieve the interactive design of users and the QAU digital museum system. Finally, from the four aspects of resource content, information presentation, resource presentation, and learning effect, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The research results show that more than 80% of people think that the content satisfaction of virtual system resources is high, which is more scientific and accurate; more than 65% think that the information is presented better, and 87% think that the system is open enough; in addition, nearly one-third of the visitors believe that using the system can initiate their interest and motivation in learning. This shows that the learning and cultural communication effects of the virtual system are more obvious. This system realizes the objective of disseminating traditional classic art culture and values by new technical means, which has reference significance for research in other fields.

AB  - Crowd sourcing is evolving as a distributed problem-solving and business production model in recent years. In crowd sourcing paradigm, tasks are distributed to networked people to complete such that a company's production cost can be greatly reduced. In 2003, Luis von Ahn and his colleagues pioneered the concept of "human computation", which utilizes human abilities to perform computation tasks that are difficult for computers to process. Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis. In this paper, we give a survey on the literature on crowd sourcing which are categorized according to their applications, algorithms, performances and datasets. This paper provides a structured view of the research on crowd sourcing to date.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has important applications in our daily lives, including health and fitness tracking, environmental monitoring, and transportation. However, sensor nodes in IoT suffer from the limited lifetime of batteries resulting from their finite energy availability. A promising solution is to harvest energy from environmental sources, such as solar, kinetic, thermal, and radio-frequency (RF) waves, for perpetual and continuous operation of IoT sensor nodes. In addition to energy generation, recently energy harvesters have been used for context detection, eliminating the need for conventional activity sensors (e.g., accelerometers), saving space, cost, and energy consumption. Using energy harvesters for simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting enables energy positive sensing-an important and emerging class of sensors, which harvest more energy than required for context detection and the additional energy can be used to power other components of the system. Although simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting is an important step forward toward autonomous self-powered sensor nodes, the energy and information availability can be still intermittent, unpredictable, and temporally misaligned with various computational tasks on the sensor node. This article provides a comprehensive survey on task scheduling algorithms for the emerging class of energy harvesting-based sensors (i.e., energy positive sensors) to achieve the sustainable operation of IoT. We discuss inherent differences between conventional sensing and energy positive sensing and provide an extensive critical analysis for devising revised task scheduling algorithms incorporating this new class of sensors. Finally, we outline future research directions toward the implementation of autonomous and self-powered IoT.

We demonstrate that our framework is able to generate a large set of varying questions given a single input image.

AB  - Risk priority number (RPN) is a widely used approach, and it is a powerful means to assess the criticality of modes in a failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) worksheet. In the application of the traditional FMECA, the RPN is determined to rank the failure modes; however, the method has been criticized several times for having many drawbacks and weaknesses, such as the presence of gaps in the range of admissible values, the duplicates value provided by different combinations of the base factors, and the high sensitivity to small changes. This paper analyses and compares some alternative RPN formulation proposed in the literature to overcome these limits. This paper takes into account only the alternative RPN, which proposes a powerful solution without increasing the computational complexity and remaining coherent to the classical idea included in the international standard IEC 60812. In order to compare the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative RPNs, an FMECA was developed for a heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) system in railway application. The critical analysis of the comparison can provide recommendations and suggestions regarding the choice of the alternative RPN based on the type of application. Finally, this paper takes into account the scales reduction of possible values related to the parameters (i.e., occurrence, severity, and detection), which influence the assessment of the RPN. This approach allows the designers to mitigate the drawbacks related to the full scale and provide an easier and faster assessment of the scores to evaluate the criticality analysis and prioritization.

Previous attempts on personality recognition have focused on a variety of different corpora (ranging from text to audiovisual data), scenarios (interviews, meetings), channels of communication (audio, video, text), and different subsets of personality traits (out of the five ones from the Big Five Model). Our study uses simple acoustic and visual nonverbal features extracted from multimodal data, which have been recorded in previously uninvestigated scenarios, and consider all five personality traits and not just a subset. First, we look at the human-machine interaction scenario, where we introduce the display of different “collaboration levels.” Second, we look at the contribution of the human-human interaction (HHI) scenario on the emergence of personality traits. Investigating the HHI scenario creates a stronger basis for future human-agents interactions. Our goal is to study, from a computational approach, the emergence degree of the five personality traits in these two scenarios. The results demonstrate the relevance of each of the two scenarios when it comes to the degree of emergence of certain traits and the feasibility to automatically recognize personality under different conditions.

AB  - This paper develops a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in railway. HVAC is a safety critical system which must ensure emergency ventilation in case of fire and in case of loss of primary ventilation functions. A study of the HVAC's critical areas is mandatory to optimize its reliability and availability and consequently to guarantee a low operation and maintenance cost. The first part of the paper describes the FMECA which is performed and reported to highlight the main criticalities of the HVAC system under analysis. Secondly, the paper deals with the problem of the evaluation of a threshold risk value, which can distinguish negligible and critical failure modes. Literature barely considers the problem of an objective risk threshold estimation. Therefore, a new analytical method based on finite difference is introduced to find a univocal risk threshold value. The method is then tested on two Risk Priority Number datasets related to the same HVAC. The threshold obtained in both cases is a good tradeoff between the risk mitigation and the cost investment for the corrective actions required to mitigate the risk level. Finally, the threshold obtained with the proposed method is compared with the methods available in literature. The comparison shows that the proposed finite difference method is a well-structured technique, with a low computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides results in line with the literature, but it completely deletes the problem of subjectivity.

AB  - In this study, working with the task of object retrieval in clutter, we have developed a robot learning framework in which Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is first applied to enable a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the intricate interactions between a robot arm and a complex scene containing many objects, allowing the DNN to partially clone the behavior of MCTS. In turn, the trained DNN is integrated into MCTS to help guide its search effort. We call this approach learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search for Object REtrieval (MORE), which delivers significant computational efficiency gains and added solution optimality. MORE is a self-supervised robotics framework/pipeline capable of working in the real world that successfully embodies the System 2 → System 1 learning philosophy proposed by Kahneman, where learned knowledge, used properly, can help greatly speed up a time-consuming decision process over time.

AB  - Game designers can use computer-aided game design methods to model how players may experience the perceived difficulty of a game. We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress.

AB  - Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9–12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.

AB  - Advancing technology nodes have increased the impact of lithography variation on design yield and performance. Although lithographic distortion is emerging as the dominant mode of failure, particulate defect still remains an important source of defect. In this work, we present a novel critical area analysis technique that deals with non-deterministic line edges that arise due to statistical lithography variations. Previous critical area analysis techniques are based on fixed printed structures with variable defect sizes. The proposed solution integrates lithographic variations within critical area analysis, using available tools while keeping the computational complexity in check. The key optimizations include weighted stratified sampling of important lithographic parameters and Monte Carlo based Probability of Failure (POF) calculation that is scalable to large chips. Simulation results on ISCAS benchmarks show that inclusion of lithography induced physical variations can increase critical area by as much as 2X, while overall yield due to particulate defects in large designs may decrease by more than 5%; validating both the need for an integrated solution and its feasibility on large designs.

AB  - Most models of thought are based on the idea of associative memory: The combination of distinct concepts through their association with each other based on experience. Thus, the pattern of associations in the mind is thought to be a critical factor in determining the ideas - both familiar and unfamiliar - that thought can generate. The Itinerant Dynamics with Emergent Attractors (IDEA) model has been proposed as a computational representation of the process by which ideas might emerge in an associative memory system. However, the effect of how “association” is defined in this context remains an important unexplored issue. In this paper, we consider three different ways of defining associations between concepts based on their joint usage in texts, and show that these lead to very different dynamics in the process of emergent conceptual combinations. We use data from two real-world text corpora to instantiate the model: The collected poems of Dylan Thomas, and the Memoirs of the economist Ludwig von Mises. The two sources differ greatly in the nature of their content as well as the statistics of their word usage, which makes them interesting subjects for comparison.

AB  - While K-12 STEM Education test scores have been steadily improving over the past decade in the United States, achievement gaps still remain among minorities and women in STEM courses and careers. There are numerous factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, low status and other sociocultural factors in classrooms that impede learning. Difficulties in STEM Education engagement and encumbered participation are often due to decontextualized learning - incongruence between meaningful contexts and learning processes. Game based learning methods are common STEM Ed models that provide youth with extrinsically motivating knowledge frameworks for learning, however, research has proven that even these procedural spaces often are disconnected from students' social and cultural realities. Amidst the STEM Ed achievement gaps problematic are similar disparities found in popular video game spaces, where there is a less than 20% chance that these same disparity groups will navigate computational worlds with protagonists that look like them. These gamers/students are lacking the “under-the-hood” (STEM) knowledge of the very games they engage with on a daily basis. This contradiction is central to this paper and the conceptualization of Metatuning - a game design pedagogical framework that aims to empower students to discover their identities as agents of change, and to see that game design can nurture their internal motivations. In this case study, Metatuning was used to foster an intrinsically motivated learning environment, where a young designer was able to iteratively design a social justice themed game that empowered her as a designer and an aspiring doctor.

AB  - Examples are useful for inspiring ideas and facilitating implementation in visualization design. However, there is little understanding of how visualization designers use examples, and how computational tools may support such activities. In this paper, we contribute an exploratory study of current practices in incorporating visualization examples. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 university students and 15 professional designers. Our analysis focus on two core design activities: searching for examples and utilizing examples. We characterize observed strategies and tools for performing these activities, as well as major challenges that hinder designers' current workflows. In addition, we identify themes that cut across these two activities: criteria for determining example usefulness, curation practices, and design fixation. Given our findings, we discuss the implications for visualization design and authoring tools and highlight critical areas for future research.

AB  - Promoting creativity is considered an important goal of education, but creativity is notoriously hard to measure. In this article, we make the journey from defining a formal measure of creativity, that is, efficiently computable to applying the measure in a practical domain. The measure is general and relies on core theoretical concepts in creativity theory, namely fluency, flexibility, and originality, integrating with prior cognitive science literature. We adapted the general measure for projects in the popular visual programming language Scratch. We designed a machine learning model for predicting the creativity of Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment aligned with the assessment of the human experts more than the experts agreed with each other. This is a first step in providing computational models for measuring creativity that can be applied to educational technologies, and to scale up the benefit of creativity education in schools.

Focusing on STEM skills development at secondary education level, a female Computer Science teacher at the 7th public Junior High school of Athens Greece, founded the voluntary Coding Club “GreekCodersK12”. This K-12 education initiative ran for 4 years (2015-2019), formed a learning community based on creativity, innovation and digital skills enhancement and collaborated with researchers, professionals, scientists who contributed voluntarily in the Club’s projects. This paper presents the experiences gained and the lessons learned during this four-year period and throws light on the role of a potential Coding Club founder. The results of this learning path, indicate that a Coding Club is an inclusive after-school programme that can function as an umbrella for innovative activities like programming, educational robotics, STEM, STEAM and ESTEAM (Entrepreneurship – Science – Technology – Engineering – Art – Mathematics).

AB  - The understanding, framing, and support of learning, working, communicating, and collaborating is media-dependent: tools, materials, and social arrangements have always been involved in defining and conceptualizing these activities. Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.

AB  - The expansion of computer science (CS) education in K-12 and higher-education in the United States has prompted deeper engagement with equity that moves beyond inclusion toward a more critical CS education. Rather than frame computing as a value-neutral tool, a justice-centered approach to equitable CS education draws on critical pedagogy to ensure the rightful presence of political struggles by emphasizing the development of not only knowledge and skills but also CS disciplinary identities. While recent efforts have integrated ethics into several areas of the undergraduate CS curriculum, critical approaches for teaching data structures and algorithms in particular are undertheorized. Basic Data Structures remains focused on runtime-centered algorithm analysis. We argue for affordance analysis, a more critical algorithm analysis based on an affordance account of value embedding. Drawing on critical methods from science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and human-computer interaction, affordance analysis examines how the design of computational abstractions such as data structures and algorithms embody affordances, which in turn embody values with political consequences. We illustrate 5 case studies of how affordance analysis refutes social determination of technology, foregrounds the limitations of data abstractions, and implicates the design of algorithms in disproportionately distributing benefits and harms to particular social identities within the matrix of domination.

AB  - The LRAFB C-130 engine repair facility is one of the top T-56 engine refurbishing plants in the United States Air Force. Currently, the shop is prevented from testing potential contingencies within their environment due to the rapid nature of their engine repair process. A simulation approach is needed to test various scenarios and determine the maximum capacity the shop can handle in its current configuration. Particularly, the simulation describes the consequences of increasing engine production on the shops personnel and throughput production figures for several policy variations. A detailed verification and validation of the model are shown, establishing the computational efficacy of the model in preparation for the comparative analysis. The model is a starting block for an Air Force wide analysis of C-130 engine rebuilding production needs with an overarching goal of standardization in repair methods and efficient operations.

AB  - Color psychology is the study of the effect of colors on human behavior. This area of study is interesting and challenging because there is no simple “one-size-fits all” mapping between a color and the message that color can evoke in a particular person. Nevertheless, many of our daily decisions are influenced by the color palettes being presented to us. In this paper, we propose a novel computational algorithm to create color palettes that convey certain messages. It starts by constructing a weighted graph of color categories and messages that are based on semantic similarities between vector representation of the messages and delta-E color similarities between colors. The color selection process for a given message includes applying a Personalized PageRank algorithm on the graph, treating the message nodes as the personalizing factors. As a result, we have a distribution of probabilities over all the color nodes that have higher probabilities for the nodes neighboring to given messages. Finally, palettes are ranked on the basis of visual aesthetics, novelty, and the conflicting/reinforcing messages they evoke. We have applied this work to several interesting use cases where artists and fashion designers used the resulting color palettes to assist their creation process.

AB  - Earth satellite networks are playing an increasingly important role in observation, surveillance and reconnaissance of specific targets or areas with dramatic growing of the demand for such services. The harsh and vulnerable space environment makes satellite nodes susceptible to a variety of attacks and prompts us to protect satellite networks by securing them with efficient defending strategy. In this paper, we propose a satellite scheduling problem in a vulnerable space environment. A set of complex operational constraints is imposed to make the best defending strategy between task requests and satellites under protection. To reduce the complexity, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems of satellite scheduling and satellite protection. A joint optimization algorithm is adopted to find near optimal solution. The results of extensive computational experiments show its effective and superior scheduling performance.

AB  - STEAM-based courses are increasingly becoming popular in introductory programming courses but not many of these efforts focus on non-major undergraduate students and less is known about its effectiveness with career-bound students at the collegiate level. This paper describes our results and the lessons learned in teaching and implementing an EarSketch based introductory programming course for non-majors. EarSketch is a computational music learning platform that has been used successfully at the high-school level to introduce students to programming. We have adapted the EarSketch curriculum to satisfy the requirements of an undergraduate level introductory programming course. We have deployed the curriculum at Georgia Gwinnett College starting in Spring 2016 with the goal of observing improvements in content knowledge and attitudes towards computing. We have observed statistically significant improvements in the sections using EarSketch. Although more data is required to confirm our results, we argue that the EarSketch based curriculum engages students positively in the field of computing.

AB  - In today's global knowledge-based economy, knowledge, its creation, accumulation and distribution, through institutions of human, organizational and social capital, plays an increasingly crucial role as the key factor in innovation and economic development. The production, distribution and processing of knowledge (especially scientific and technological) is increasingly performed within the domain of computational information and communication technologies (ICTs). Even though there is an asymmetric distribution of ICT resources, particularly between developed and developing countries the emergence of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) is a means to bridge the `digital divide'. This paper examines the use of FOSS for mapping and measuring the National System of Innovation (NSI) in Ghana and generating evidence based policy. Findings indicate the value of FOSS in mapping and measuring for evidence based policy and the crucial role of ICT in the NSI.

AB  - Whether the central nervous system of primates uses a body-centered or an eye-centered frame for reaching is still a controversial debate in neurosciences. Does the proprioceptive information allow to represent the visual information with respect to the body or inversely, does it transform the hand position in retinal coordinates? In this paper, we implement and test two control schemes associated to each of these two hypotheses by using a computational approach from robotics. To this end, biological models of motor control are applied to a realistic dynamic model of upper body including a 4 DOF eye-neck kinematic chain and a 6DOF arm. Important characteristics, such as proprioceptive biases and sensory delay, are considered. Simulation results allow to compare the geometry of trajectories and illustrate the better robustness of the eye-centered control scheme with respect to biases and sensory delay. Applications to the control of the humanoid robot HRP2 are finally presented.

AB  - Pure scientists do not only invent new methods to solve given problems. They also invent new problems. The recent POWERPLAY framework formalizes this type of curiosity and creativity in a new, general, yet practical way. To acquire problem solving prowess through playing, POWERPLAY-based artificial explorers by design continually come up with the fastest to find, initially novel, but eventually solvable problems. They also continually simplify or speed up solutions to previous problems. We report on results of first experiments with POWERPLAY. A self-delimiting recurrent neural network (SLIM RNN) is used as a general computational architecture to implement the system's solver. Its weights can encode arbitrary, self-delimiting, halting or non-halting programs affecting both environment (through effectors) and internal states encoding abstractions of event sequences. In open-ended fashion, our POWERPLAY-driven RNNs learn to become increasingly general problem solvers, continually adding new problem solving procedures to the growing repertoire, exhibiting interesting developmental stages.

AB  - The prime focus on the deliberations related to Industry 5.0 lies in creativity, efficiency and resilience for adapting various organic components such as accurate decisions, customized demands in consumer electronics with promising/sustainable solutions. This transformation and paradigm shift inside the Industry 5.0 frame can be comprehensively understood by integrating the factors related to human values with the cutting-edge technologies of consumer electronics for compatibility with the issue of sustainable development. The present work proposes an integrated approach for extensive study with a set of criteria and possible Industry 5.0 enablers in consumer electronics using a novel decision-making approach. The approach comprises of  $T$ -spherical fuzzy information containment/processing through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and then utilizing the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) sequentially to obtain the necessary weights of selected criteria. Further, the obtained weights from AHP would be used in WASPAS for the computational assessment while finding the prioritization/ranking of industry 5.0 enablers. The results with the sensitivity analysis validate the robustness-cum-resilience of the proposed integrated approach with standard managerial implications and the findings take care of cognitive in the human socio-technical environment. The regulated adoption of Industry 5.0 enablers would help consumer electronics manufacturers in finding optimized solutions.

AB  - A computational aesthetics model developed for the game of international chess showed a good and positive correlation with human player aesthetic assessment. The unique approach taken here suggests that, in addition to things like personal taste and environmental factors, humans also likely assess beauty based on `universal metrics' within the domain itself. From the standpoint of artificial intelligence (AI), this means that weights for aesthetic features need not, for example, be determined by analyzing a particular data set of aesthetically-rated objects, or through consultation with human experts. Instead, certain metrics can be used as `building blocks' to formalize aesthetic principles or features in a logical and dynamic way. This is arguably an improvement over existing methods. The aesthetics model developed is explained and relevant experimental results are presented. The importance of universal metrics in the aesthetics of chess and other domains is also explored.

AB  - In this research full paper, we examine students’ improvement in spatial visualization skills when using MYR (short for "My Reality"), a browser-based, cloud-hosted programming environment for beginning through advanced programmers to create immersive, three-dimensional virtual reality scenes.The research literature suggests that there is correlation between students’ spatial abilities and their success in programming. In this study, we conducted a three-week (six hour) virtual after-school program which introduced high school students with different programming backgrounds to coding in MYR. During the program, students learned the basics of MYR, introductory CS topics, and completed individual coding projects, creating an original MYR scene.A study examined changes in students’ spatial reasoning as a result of this intervention. The students’ performance in spatial skills was measured using the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R) [1]. Students completed this instrument using a pre/post survey design. We analyzed the impact of the intervention using a paired samples T-test. We further developed a rubric for analyzing the sophistication of students’ MYR code and applied it to evaluating the programming expertise of our study participants.The program was hosted twice with two different groups of high school students. Most showed interest in MYR programming and expressed their creativity and learned skills in their original project. With the first group of students, we found increases in their spatial visualization performance after the intervention with MYR, though statistical significance was not reached. The second group of students had higher baseline prior experience in computing and spatial visualization skills; these students did not further increase in their spatial visualization skill.The analysis showed that the MYR has a potential to improve spatial skills and engage students’ interest in computing. We recommend that MYR and related computational environments be further studied and made available to students.

AB  - In order to analyze Electrocardiograms (ECGs) in real time, this research is the first to integrate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into a cloud-based healthcare system. By utilizing sophisticated computational algorithms and an interpretivist perspective, the research seeks to transform cardiac diagnosis. Though extremely useful, traditional ECG analysis techniques have processing speed as well as scalability issues. The suggested method instantaneously interprets ECG waveforms by utilizing RNNs' temporal modeling capabilities. This paradigm change makes it possible to identify cardiac problems in a timely manner, potentially improving patient outcomes. Setting up a scalable cloud system for effective data processing is part of the study methodology. The RNN model is trained, verified, and then incorporated into the cloud system using secondary ECG data. The system's efficacy is confirmed by performance evaluation criteria like processing speed, sensitivity, and accuracy. Scalability, safety of data, and interpretability issues in models are highlighted via critical analysis. Techniques for improved model openness, strict data protection policies, and thorough scalability testing are all included in the recommendations.

AB  - Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an influential technique in the field of deep learning that combines the content of one image with the style of another, resulting in visually impressive compositions. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG19, a well-known pretrained model that excels at extracting advanced characteristics from images, NST algorithms may efficiently isolate and merge content and style representations. This project aims to create a user-friendly Neural Style Transfer (NST) application. The frontend of the program will be constructed using React, enabling users to easily upload their content and style images. Next, the user can initiate the process of neural style transfer by clicking on the style transfer button. The computational process of style transfer is managed by a backend system that utilizes Celery, a distributed task queue, and Redis, an in-memory data structure store. This architectural design allows for effective asynchronous execution of style transfer activities, assuring the ability to handle large workloads while maintaining scalability and responsiveness. Our NST application combines advanced deep learning algorithms with modern web development technology to make artistic creativity accessible to everyone. Users may effortlessly produce compelling visual compositions with just a few clicks. Our website provides a smooth and entertaining experience for both beginners and expert users, whether they want to turn regular photos into works of art resembling famous styles or explore innovative combinations. The proposed NST application combines state-of-the-art algorithms with a user-friendly interface, making powerful AI-driven creativity accessible to everyone.

AB  - This article introduces a novel approach to remote laboratory instruction, specifically designed for teaching three-dimensional modeling using Blender software. The lab uses virtual machines to provide students with the necessary computational power to carry out the course activities, along with the correct version of the software. The flipped remote lab approach combines the elements of flipped classroom and peer assessment, making it suitable for face-to-face, totally online, or hybrid classes. Prior to each of the two lectures, students begin to practice by replicating the instructor's demonstrations in a set of concise tutorials. Upon completion of the assigned tasks, students carry out self-assessments of their own modeling, in addition to assessing two models created by their peers. A rubric comprising three questions facilitates the assessment process and allows providing feedback on each response. During the subsequent lecture, students work together with the instructor to address challenges encountered in their modeling, exploring also the advanced aspects of software usage that time constraints preclude in a traditional setting. The analysis of the flipped remote lab results reveals that student responses in peer-assessment activities are relevant to the posed questions. Moreover, the students who realized the models demonstrated a comparable level of rigor in self-assessment as their mates who reviewed their works. While students express a high degree of appreciation for the laboratory activities, a notable concern is the highlighted heavy workload. Increasing the allocated time for task completion can help mitigate the workload impact. The article concludes with insights gained from the implementation of the flipped remote lab approach.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize various facets of human existence, its influence in creative domains, particularly literature, has increasingly come to be pronounced. The following paper will handle the ways that character development is changing in modern fiction. It investigates the ways in which AI technologies are outlining the way the creation, representation, and perception of characters in fiction are being developed. That means AI is advancing in character creation in ways that open up a whole new set of doors for writers: the use of powerful tools to generate, field, analyze, and refine their characters in ways previously unthinkable. Using the algorithms of natural language processing (NLP), these days, AI is used to help write dialogue, create characters with their traits, and sometimes even develop the entire character’s arc. This union of human creativity and computational powers doesn’t just make the process of writing faster but, rather, opens doors for new possibilities in innovative storytelling. AI-driven analytics help authors to pick up the insight into reader preferences and trends that tend to help them develop character traits and the storyline, most appealing to the readers. The application of machine-learning algorithms to vast repositories of literature seems to derive character dynamics and tropes that are so archetyped, but their renderings are much more nuanced and impactful. At the same time, this AI character raises very basic questions about authorship, creativity, and the nature of the story. As more and more writers adopt AI for character generation, they do raise some question about authenticity and originality.

AB  - We report a study investigating the viability of using interactive visualizations to aid architectural design with building codes. While visualizations have been used to support general architectural design exploration, existing computational solutions treat building codes as separate from, rather than part of, the design process, creating challenges for architects. Through a series of participatory design studies with professional architects, we found that interactive visualizations have promising potential to aid design exploration and sensemaking in early stages of architectural design by providing feedback about potential allowances and consequences of design decisions. However, implementing a visualization system necessitates addressing the complexity and ambiguity inherent in building codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose various user-driven knowledge management mechanisms for integrating, negotiating, interpreting, and documenting building code rules.

AB  - Power line extraction is not only crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) obstacle avoidance, but also a fundamental step for fault diagnosis of power lines. Therefore, achieving robust and accurate extraction of power lines in aerial images is essential to enable intelligent UAVs inspection. Unfortunately, power line extraction is an extremely challenging task, and all the current methods attempt to utilize a single model to solve the problem of power line extraction in complex and variable scenes. This results in insufficient generalization ability and suboptimal computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a power line scene classification network based on complexity assessment, named SceneNet, which can provide a solution for tackling power line extraction challenges. First, we propose a human–machine hybrid reasoning model to obtain the ground truth of image complexity reasonably and build the first benchmark dataset that can be used for automatic classification research of power line scenes. Second, we propose an improved StyleGAN3 model and loop transfer learning strategy for data augmentation. Most importantly, the SceneNet comprises a multifeature joint embedding module and a feature encoding–decoding module. On one hand, it achieves the multilevel fusion of artificial features and high-dimensional semantic features. On the other hand, we use a self-attention mechanism to enable full use of the contextual association between each block of the fusion feature map. The SceneNet has successfully achieved the mapping and pattern recognition between the abstract concept and the concrete features. Experimental results demonstrate that the SceneNet is obviously superior to the existing 12 state-of-the-art models, and it provides guidance and delineation of applicable scenes for power line extraction methods.

AB  - There has recently been considerable interest in automatic detection strategies for recognising application layer security threats such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Slow Denial of-Service (Slow DoS) attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Most existing approaches however, fail to take cognisance of the substantial resource constraints imposed upon IoT environments, which limits the applicability and deployment of many Slow DoS detection mechanisms. This paper addresses this significant security threat for resource scarce IoT nodes and networks in proposing an accurate and computationally efficient approach to packet-based intrusion detection of HTTP Slow DoS activity. The paper both critically analyses and measures the impact of applying network attribute filtering and packet sampling to reduce the computational overheads on the resource constrained IoT Slow DoS detection node. The unique solution proposed uses a dataset synthesised from a live IoT environment comprising both legitimate and malicious network events in the form of legitimate HTTP traffic and Slow DoS attacks. Experimental results corroborate that combining filtering at the Border Router of only in-bound packets containing no TCP payload with a systematic packet sampling scheme at a sampling ratio of up to 1:64, the processing overheads on the detection node are significantly reduced. The novel contribution presented is a resource efficient solution, garnered by employing systematic sampling to seamlessly and accurately support selective attribute-based intrusion detection of HTTP Slow DoS attacks in IoT networks.

AB  - This paper outlines an approach to a series of "open" purpose "architecture" generators and related systems. The word "architecture" is here defined in the broadest of linguistic manners. This paper outlines the long-term goals for the facilitation of the functional components of this 'system of systems', although the system will be designed to be extensible as a large-scale open source project. Three major components make up the system: 1) one or more databases, 2) a means to generate intelligent queries, and 3) a virtual media space to display media elements and processes as derived from the queries/interaction. I will begin by discussing precursors and historical problems related to computational creativity and symbiotic creative systems. Given the non-linear nature of the subject matter, the following text will progress in a modular manner, where much of the paper could we read in differing orders. Thus, it will not unfold in the linear manner of other more traditional IEEE papers, and should be explored with this intentionality by the reader. The project takes a multi-perspective approach to the subject matter in which no overarching hierarchy can be given, suggesting the need for such a form. Thus I will draw on the IEEE formatting related to "Component Heads" -- "components of your paper and are not topically subordinate to each other." This structure also mirrors the functionality of the system itself which seeks to explore dynamic heterarchical combinatorics as its overarching methodology as an intelligent system. Thus the reader may need to work harder at making the creative jumps that enable this analogue "system" to function by reading each of these different component heads in relation to each other and articulating their own connections between the components. This is a Koestler-like bisociational approach[1]. Thus the paper itself becomes an analogue combinatoric "architecture" used to discuss this project.

AB  - Quantization is an integral part of image acquisition but also a major performance bottleneck due to the trade-off between dynamic range and resolution. As we discuss in this paper, in contrast, quantization noise can be acquired reliably even beyond the dynamic range by re-purposing recent hardware development. In this paper, we introduce and mathematically analyze an algorithm to recover images from this information, thus giving rise to a novel, single-shot, high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging approach. Our method directly works with a refined model for sensor outputs at the digitization stage and crucially exploits smoothing anti-aliasing artifacts. We derive recovery guarantees and demonstrate the validity of our approach via computer experiments. Our work suggests re-thinking of the imaging pipeline as seeming sensing artifacts can lead to improved reconstruction when combined with proper computational methodology.

AB  - Thinking about the protection of biometric data, future attacks using a quantum computer call for adequate resistance of biometric verification systems. Such systems are often deployed on a long-term basis and deserve strong protection due to the sensitive nature and persistence property of the data they contain. To achieve efficient template protection, we combine post-quantum secure two-party computation with secret sharing and apply the first practically implemented post-quantum secure two-party computation protocol for the purpose of biometric template protection. The proposed system ensures permanent protection of the biometric data as templates are stored and compared in the encrypted domain. For the verification, we present two options which can be achieved as real-time transactions: A well-established classical two-party computation scheme or a recent post-quantum upgrade of that scheme. Both methods maintain full biometric performance. For the database of reference templates, which is a target for attacks in a biometric system, post-quantum security is maintained throughout both verification options. Regarding the computational efficiency of our proposed system, we offer real-time computational transaction times, making our solution relevant for practical applications.

AB  - This paper discusses a novel approach that addresses the problem of supporting the Commander's dynamic information requirements through automation of the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) for time-constrained environments and training purposes, as part of the Tactical Human Integration of Networked Knowledge (THINK) Army Technology Objective - Research (ATO-R) initiative. We demonstrate this capability with automated user support for the execution of battle drills. Our approach is based on adapting the R-CAST cognitively-inspired agent architecture towards a context-aware anticipation of information requirements. R-CAST is a computational model of the Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model, which models human decision making under time stress. R-CAST agents support and collaborate with human decision making teams as both “smart aids” and “effective teammates” by anticipating, investigating, seeking, and interpreting information relevant to decision making. A key feature of R-CAST is that the proactive sharing of information relevant to decision making is automatically generated by the computational RPD model. The fundamental research question being addressed is whether the inclusion of R-CAST in Army staff processes improves said staff understanding and execution of battle tasks. We adapted R-CAST to Battle Drill #26 (i.e., responding to an IED event) as a proof of concept for team decision making under stress and constant switching of modalities. We demonstrate that the use of R-CAST cognitive agents effectively assists the Battle Manager in the S3 cell with auto-filling certain forms required by doctrine in response to the dynamism of the current state of the environment, improving cognitive performance in this task. Our novel approach integrates relevant context in communication, information, and socio-cognitive networks, coupled with cognitive modeling. We report initial findings that we can use the R-CAST cognitive framework to effectively and efficiently develop individual intelligent training tools that understand and support the dynamic information requirements of Commanders.

The model is based on the Viable Systems Approach (VSA) and links this theory with Creativity and Open innovation via the definition of proper consonance and resonance relationships. VSA is an interdisciplinary approach grounded on systems thinking and resource-based theory, and focused on methodologies to govern relations among supra-systems and subsystems. Leveraging on the systems perspective of the creativity proposed by Csikszentmihalyi, we defined a way to analyse and understand how the variety introduced by workers in organization can lead to novel and useful products and services. We present also our preliminary results on how a well-defined set of knowledge based methodologies and techniques, resulting from the ARISTOTELE research project, can be applied to this purpose in the context of a Gene lore model. We believe our proposal, i.e. the application of VSA methods combined with knowledge based techniques, can lead to substantial advantages in several areas of Computational Creativity.

AB  - Phishing, a prevalent cyber danger in contemporary times, involves the fraudulent impersonation of legitimate websites with the intention of deceiving users into divulging confidential information. The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the “Zérosdetect” approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning’s adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing.

AB  - Entrepreneurship education is critical in encouraging students' innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. It provides essential skills and knowledge, enabling them to open their creative potential and apply innovative thinking across diverse professional fields. With the widespread application of large language models in education, intelligent-assisted teaching in entrepreneurship education is stepping into a new learning phase anytime and anywhere. Entrepreneurship education extends across interdisciplinary knowledge fields, incorporating subjects like finance and risk management, which require advanced mathematical computational skills. This complexity presents new challenges for artificial intelligence-assisted question-and-answer models. The study explores how students can maximize the knowledge repository of current large language models to improve learning efficiency. Experimentally validates the performance differences between large language models and graph convolutional reasoning models regarding the complex semantic reasoning and mathematical computational demands in entrepreneurship education questions. Based on case studies, it is found that despite the broad prospects of large language models in entrepreneurship education, they still need to improve in practical applications. Especially in tasks within entrepreneurship education that demand precision, such as mathematical computations and risk assessment, the accuracy and efficiency of existing models still need improvement. Therefore, further exploration into algorithm optimization, model fusion, and other technical enhancements can improve the processing capabilities of intelligent question-and-answer systems for specific domain issues, aiming to meet the practical needs of entrepreneurship education.

AB  - Decision making is one of the common human activities. But in complex, interactive, and dynamic systems, it is extremely important to make decisions scientifically because the influence of the behavior after decision making is generally irreversible. The predictability of behavior influence is an effective way to improve the scientific decision making. As a new branch of computing, computational experiment is an emerging management method for research on complex systems. In this paper, based on particle swarm intelligence, an evolutionary adaptive system model of brand innovation in the toy industry cluster is constructed. By imitating the evolution process of the complex adaptive system, this method is helpful to analyze the impact of the management behavior brought to simulation system, predict the management behavior in real world, and finally choose the best management strategy. This simulation tried to figure out the affection of government regulation strategies and provide corresponding assessments and recommendations, which gives a new solution to assist the government to effectively judge the influence of the macro policy, as well as provides a new way of thinking of the related intelligent decision making.

AB  - Phishing is the enchanting utilization of automated trades to cheat and exploit clients. Phishing attacks exertion to get intriguing, private information, for instance, usernames, passwords, charge card information, and affiliation confirmations, absolutely. By acting like a real individual or foundation through telephone or email, electronic aggressors utilize social expecting to push occurrences toward performing unequivocal activities like tapping on a perilous collusion or affiliation or wilfully uncovering private data. Nowadays, aggressors use different correspondence mediums to talk with the adversities, for instance, email, message (SMS), telephone, and others. No matter what the quick movement of Internet show based illuminating affiliations, SMS genuinely remains an obvious correspondence relationship in our lives as of in the relatively recent past. For example, a few affiliations consider that messages are more convincing than messages. This is thinking about the way that 82% of SMSs are explored inside 5 min., yet clients simply open one of each four messages they get. The significance of generally suggests irritating or unconstrained messages got by phone clients through Short Messaging Service (SMS). The SMS phishing is another strategy where the phisher works the SMS as a medium to visit with individuals being suggested and this system is seen as smishing (SMS+phishing). In any case, SMS is one of the potential instruments to really chat with others through phones without the web. As Transfer Learning from colossal degree set up models ends up being more inevitable in Natural Language Processing (NLP), working these huge models in on-the-edge as well as under obliged computational arrangement or confirmation monetary plans stays testing. Phones are famous with engineers since they're expected fast responses pondering insignificant huge information. For seeing phishing attacks in low computational contraptions we can use a quantized model. This work focuses on seeing SMS phishing attacks continuously with the help of BERT in edges. Not the slightest bit like reliable language depiction models, BERT expected to pre-train basic bidirectional depictions from unlabeled text by customarily shaping on both left and right setting in all layers.

To convey the essence of his distinctive critique, the article focuses on Taube's attack on the general problem solver (GPS), the second major AI program. After examining his analysis of the social construction of this and other “thinking machines,” it concludes that, despite technical changes in AI, much of Taube's criticism remains relevant today. Moreover, his status as an “information processing” insider who criticized AI on behalf of the public good challenges the boundaries and focus of most critiques of AI from the past half-century. In sum, Taube's work offers an alternative model from which contemporary AI workers and critics can learn much.

Everywhere there is talk of the advantages that AI can mean for the future in our daily lives, as well as its possible applications. The future of "standard" medical practice could appear here ahead of schedule, where a patient could go to a computer before seeing a doctor. Through advances in AI, it becomes more possible for the days of misdiagnosis and treatment of the symptoms of the disease, rather than its root cause, to be left behind. Think about how many years of blood pressure measurements you have or how much storage you would need to remove so that you can fit a complete 3D image of an organ on your laptop. The idea of artificial intelligence in medicine may make you think of robots roaming the halls of a hospital in the distant future, but AI is already here.

AB  - Scientific projects involving volunteers for analyzing, collecting data, and using their computational resources, known as Citizen Science (CS), have become popular due to advances in information and communication technology (ICT). Many CS projects have been proposed to involve citizens in different knowledge domain such as astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. This work presents a CS project called ForestEyes, which proposes to track deforestation in rainforests by asking volunteers to analyze and classify remote sensing images. These manually classified data are used as input for training a pattern classifier that will be used to label new remote sensing images. ForestEyes project was created on the Zooniverse.org CS platform, and to attest the quality of the volunteers' answers, were performed early campaigns with remote sensing images from Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). The results were processed and compared to an oracle classification (PRODES - Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project). Two and a half weeks after launch, more than 35,000 answers from 383 volunteers (117 anonymous and 266 registered users) were received, completing all 2050 tasks. The ForestEyes campaigns' results have shown that volunteers achieved excellent effectiveness results in remote sensing image classification task. Furthermore, these results show that CS might be a powerful tool to quickly obtain a large amount of high-quality labeled data.

AB  - This study delves into the domain of dynamical systems, specifically the forecasting of dynamical time series defined through an evolution function. Traditional approaches in this area predict the future behavior of dynamical systems by inferring the evolution function. However, these methods may confront obstacles due to the presence of missing variables, which are usually attributed to challenges in measurement and a partial understanding of the system of interest. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the autoregressive with slack time series (ARS) model, that simultaneously estimates the evolution function and imputes missing variables as a slack time series. Assuming time-invariance and linearity in the (underlying) entire dynamical time series, our experiments demonstrate the ARS model’s capability to forecast future time series. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a 2-dimensional time-invariant and linear system can be reconstructed by utilizing observations from a single, partially observed dimension of the system.

AB  - This paper makes a contribution to the development of computational archival science by thinking about and linking computational and archival thinking. It suggests that archival thinking and the archival problem space encompasses questions about the nature of consciousness, highlighting how these questions seem to be apparent within the fundamental archival principles of respect des fonds, provenance and original order. It seeks to shift attention back to provenance, not just in the sense of where a given object has come from, but also in the sense of the grounds on which it becomes an object and it suggests that the application of computational methods and tools for archival purposes and the integration of computational with archival thinking may offer a way to maintain awareness of this more philosophical dimension in practice.

AB  - PointNet has revolutionized how we think about representing point clouds. For classification and segmentation tasks, the approach and its subsequent variants/extensions are considered state-of-the-art. To date, the successful application of PointNet to point cloud registration has remained elusive. In this paper we argue that PointNet itself can be thought of as a learnable "imaging" function. As a consequence, classical vision algorithms for image alignment can be brought to bear on the problem -- namely the Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm. Our central innovations stem from: (i) how to modify the LK algorithm to accommodate the PointNet imaging function, and (ii) unrolling PointNet and the LK algorithm into a single trainable recurrent deep neural network. We describe the architecture, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art in several common registration scenarios. The architecture offers some remarkable properties including: generalization across shape categories and computational efficiency -- opening up new paths of exploration for the application of deep learning to point cloud registration.

AB  - This paper proposes the compact differential evolution (cDE) algorithm. cDE, like other compact evolutionary algorithms, does not process a population of solutions but its statistic description which evolves similarly to all the evolutionary algorithms. In addition, cDE employs the mutation and crossover typical of differential evolution (DE) thus reproducing its search logic. Unlike other compact evolutionary algorithms, in cDE, the survivor selection scheme of DE can be straightforwardly encoded. One important feature of the proposed cDE algorithm is the capability of efficiently performing an optimization process despite a limited memory requirement. This fact makes the cDE algorithm suitable for hardware contexts characterized by small computational power such as micro-controllers and commercial robots. In addition, due to its nature cDE uses an implicit randomization of the offspring generation which corrects and improves the DE search logic. An extensive numerical setup has been implemented in order to prove the viability of cDE and test its performance with respect to other modern compact evolutionary algorithms and state-of-the-art population-based DE algorithms. Test results show that cDE outperforms on a regular basis its corresponding population-based DE variant. Experiments have been repeated for four different mutation schemes. In addition cDE outperforms other modern compact algorithms and displays a competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art population-based algorithms employing a DE logic. Finally, the cDE is applied to a challenging experimental case study regarding the on-line training of a nonlinear neural-network-based controller for a precise positioning system subject to changes of payload. The main peculiarity of this control application is that the control software is not implemented into a computer connected to the control system but directly on the micro-controller. Both numerical results on the test functions and experimental results on the real-world problem are very promising and allow us to think that cDE and future developments can be an efficient option for optimization in hardware environments characterized by limited memory.

We conclude with a vision of FIFIVERIFY tools, which would automatically find faults, fix them and verify the fixes. We explain why we think such FIFIVERIFY tools constitute an exciting challenge for the SBSE community that already could be within its reach.

AB  - Radio-based indoor localization is currently a very vibrant scientific research field with many potential use cases. It offers high value for customers, for example, in the fields of robotics, logistics, and automation, or in context-aware IT services. Especially for autonomous systems, dynamic human-machine interaction, or augmented reality applications, precise localization coupled with a high update rate is a key. In this paper, we present a completely novel localization concept whereby received radio signal phase values that are fed into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) without any preprocessing are evaluated. Standard preprocessing steps, such as angle-of-arrival estimation, beamforming, and time-of-flight or time-difference-of-arrival estimations are not required with this approach. The innovative localization concept benefits from the high sensitivity of radio signals' phase to distance changes and the fast and straightforward recursive computation offered by the EKF. It completely forgoes the computational burden of other phase-based high-precision localization techniques, such as synthetic aperture methods. To verify the proposed method, we use an exemplary setup employing a 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (CW) single-input multiple-output secondary radar with 250 MHz bandwidth. A high-precision six-axis robotic arm serves as a 3D positioning reference. The test setup emulates a realistic industrial indoor environment with significant multipath reflections. Despite the challenging conditions and the rather low bandwidth, the results show an outstanding localization 3D RMSE of around 1.7 cm. The proposed method can easily be applied to nearly any type of radio signal with CW carrier and is an attractive alternative to common multilateration and multiangulation localization approaches. We think it is a quantum leap in wireless locating, as it has the potential for precise, simple, and low-cost wireless localization even with standard narrowband communication signals.

AB  - Skylight polarized patterns provide fresh thinking for the human to use the information sources in nature for orientation, but this orientation method is susceptible to weather conditions. Especially, in the case of cloudy weather, the cloud directly leads to the decline of orientation precision. In this article, a robust bionic polarized skylight orientation method based on the model consistency of polarization patterns (MCOPPs) is proposed for cloudy weather. First, we made full use of the DOP information to preprocess the polarization information as an aid to the subsequent polarization light orientation. Then, based on the vertical feature of the E-vector of the polarized light and the scattering plane, we developed the MCOPP error criterion and proposed a two-step optimizing framework for the effective selection of the interior points. Finally, the outdoor static rotating experiment and the dynamic vehicle experiment are conducted for evaluating our algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that MCOPP can realize an effective and robust polarized orientation under cloudy conditions, and the accuracy of orientation in the outdoor static experiment is within 0.5° and in the dynamic car experiment is within 0.7°. Compared with the other four classic methods, the RMSE of the orientation error can be decreased by 50.6% in the outdoor static experiment and by 46.0% in the dynamic vehicle experiment. Especially, the proposed MCOPP has lower computational complexity than the existing robust polarized skylight method.

AB  - The increasing demand for higher data rates and for more connected devices has led to Massive MIMO (MMIMO) Technology. The large number of antennas makes the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector infeasible to be implemented due to high complexity, despite its optimal performance. Sphere Decoder (SD) has a bit error rate (BER) performance similar to ML detector, therefore making it more efficient (0.5-1.25 dB gain) than Linear Detectors (LD), proposed in the literature. However, the low complexity of LD and the non-deterministic behavior of SD are the main reasons that prohibit the use of sphere decoding methods in MMIMO systems. The results of this paper disrupt conventional thinking and show that there may be a future for SD in certain MMIMO system. The number of visited nodes during detection and the Initial Radius (IR) method are crucial for the computational complexity of SD. In this paper, an effective IR method, decreasing significantly the complexity and the number of visited nodes is proposed. Furthermore an optimization at tree searching further reduces the number of visited nodes, where in combination with an implementation featured with one-node-per-cycle architecture minimize the latency and make the SD attainable to large-scale systems for $E_{b}/N_{0}\geq 4 \ \mathrm{dB}$. Hardware aspects are investigated for both a Virtex-7 FPGA and a 28 nm ASIC technology.

AB  - Code review is a popular practice where developers critique each others' changes. Since automated builds can identify low-level issues (e.g., syntactic errors, regression bugs), it is not uncommon for software organizations to incorporate automated builds in the code review process. In such code review deployment scenarios, submitted change sets must be approved for integration by both peer code reviewers and automated build bots. Since automated builds may produce an unreliable signal of the status of a change set (e.g., due to “flaky” or non-deterministic execution behaviour), code review tools, such as Gerrit, allow developers to request a “recheck”, which repeats the build process without updating the change set. We conjecture that an unconstrained recheck command will waste time and resources if it is not applied judiciously. To explore how the recheck command is applied in a practical setting, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 66,932 code reviews from the OpenStack community. We quantitatively analyze (i) how often build failures are rechecked; (ii) the extent to which invoking recheck changes build failure outcomes; and (iii) how much waste is generated by invoking recheck. We observe that (i) 55% of code reviews invoke the recheck command after a failing build is reported; (ii) invoking the recheck command only changes the outcome of a failing build in 42% of the cases; and (iii) invoking the recheck command increases review waiting time by an average of 2,200% and equates to 187.4 compute years of waste-enough compute resources to compete with the oldest land living animal on earth. Our observations indicate that the recheck command is frequently used after the builds fail, but does not achieve a high likelihood of build success. Based on a developer survey and our history-based quantitative findings, we encourage reviewer teams to think twice before rechecking and be considerate of waste. While recheck currently generates plenty of wasted computational resources and bloats waiting times, it also presents exciting future opportunities for researchers and tool builders to propose solutions that can reduce waste.

AB  - The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way people think about computational intelligence in real-life applications. It brought to life concepts such as smart cities, which could not have been realized using classic computing technologies. While domains like health, manufacturing, and agriculture have gained greatly from the introduction of internet-connected, low-cost smart monitoring and control devices, the energy sector remains the most significant application of IoT technologies. The most recent works on smart energy systems focus on the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. While renewable energy has been a key topic of research for decades, its adoption at large scale has been hindered by reliability and intermittency issues. Internet of Things can provide solutions to overcome such issues and enable grid integration by providing means for remote and real-time monitoring and performance analysis of solar facilities. This paper presents smart solar energy systems as an IoT application and derives primary system requirements of IoT middleware required for building efficient, scalable, and reliable grid-integrated large-scale and distributed smart solar farms.

AB  - Making neuro-inspired structures more resistant to common difficulties is the focus of this study. AI and deep learning are crucial in many fields; therefore, neural networks must be reliable and durable. This post proposes a robust framework using 10 advanced tactics for a new and complete robustness approach. Our technique uses dropout, gradient masking, transfer learning, adversarial training, randomized smoothing, input preparation, strong activation functions, ensemble learning, Bayesian neural networks, and gradient masking. These strategies are aimed at addressing hostile assaults, noise, and environmental changes. Combining these approaches makes the system more versatile, making it ideal for self-driving vehicles, medical diagnostics, and hacking. We conducted comprehensive research to evaluate the proposed method’s accuracy, durability, resistance, generalization, computational cost, and real-world usage. Line charts illustrate the method’s strengths and weaknesses. These numbers demonstrate how the proposed approach differs from previous ones. They demonstrate its versatility and efficacy. Finally, our results demonstrate a reliable, versatile, and proven method for neural network resilience. Our method handles common modifications using sophisticated methods. This yields a forward-thinking, effective solution to AI environmental changes. The reliability of neuro-inspired systems has improved, which will affect artificial intelligence.

AB  - In 1982, geodemographics was “the new magic.” The system promised to pinpoint voters. One of its key developers, Jonathan Robbin, boasted, “Tell me someone's zip code, and I can predict what they eat, drink, drive—even think.” What was the secret? Robbin and his company, the Claritas Corporation, were among the first to merge newly digitized census data and computational social science into a geodemographic system called PRIZM. It produced new categories of populations known as clusters. These clusters provided a novel and legible form of computer demographics for marketers reliant on direct mail. Drawing on interviews and historical research, this article chronicles the understudied history of the Claritas Corporation. At a time of growing distress about microtargeting and behavioral advertising, the Claritas Corporation is a critical case to understand how computing changed how marketers and politicians distinguished, described, and marketed to Americans.

AB  - IoT devices have changed into one of the mainstays in areas like houses, industry and education, resulting in a level of convenience and efficiency that has never been achieved before. Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren’t IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system’s efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT. Without the involvement of different technologies, it won’t be easy to ensure safety and create some reliable IoT ecosystems.

AB  - Active learning provides useful tools to reduce annotation costs without compromising classifier performance. However it traditionally views the supervisor simply as a labeling machine. Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e.g. "I think this is a forest, what do you think?". If the learner is wrong, the supervisor provides an explanation e.g. "No, this is too open to be a forest". With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label-but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories.

AB  - Wearable activity tracking devices associated with the Quantified Self movement have potential benefit for educational settings because they produce authentic and granular data about activities and experiences already familiar to youth. This article explores how that potential could be realized through explicit acknowledgment of and response to tacit design assumptions about how such technologies will be used in practice and strategic design for use in a classroom. We argue that particular practical adaptations that we have identified serve to ensure that the classroom and educational use cases are appropriately considered. As an example of how those adaptations are realized in actual elementary classrooms, we describe an effort to provide fifth-grade students each with their own Fitbit activity trackers in the context of a multi-week unit exploring core ideas in elementary statistics. Observational descriptions and transcript excerpts of students and teachers discussing their own Fitbit data are presented to illustrate what opportunities exist to leverage youth familiarity with daily activities in a way that targets development of statistical thinking. Quantitative written test results showing learning gains and differences between traditional and wearable device-enhanced instruction are also presented. Improvement on several statistical thinking constructs is identified, including in the areas of data display, conceptions of statistics, modeling variability, and informal inference.

AB  - The development of phonological awareness, i.e. the metacognitive skill that allows thinking and manipulating the language structure, from an early age is mandatory for the acquisition of literacy skills. Multisensory stimulation, curiosity and interest are fundamental for learning. In doing so, Communication Technologies have a key role because a learning-oriented use can encourage current digital natives&#x2019; interest and thinking. This paper presents a game with tangible technology designed for both intervention and diagnostic, formative and summative evaluation. The user experience was carried out during two weeks through a multiple case study with four kindergarten children. A multimedia adventure game was presented in which they had to solve phonological awareness challenges through the manipulation of tangible technology to achieve the final goal. The observation was recorded in the designed evaluation model, allowing the analysis of pre- and post-intervention data after the triangulation of data for subsequent qualitative analysis. The results show an improvement in phonological awareness, as well as the gamified experience marks. These promising outcomes support the use of such methodologies to a learner-centered education model.

AB  - Education is an essential aspect in building the social value and norm to produce individuals who can think in high order thinking through learning and teaching activities. As technology keeps growing, an online learning platform has emerged. This platform is called e-Learning. e-Learning allows teachers to save many questions into the e-Learning question bank. However, these questions need to be reviewed so the questions can be matched with the achievement of competence. One educational identification standard that is often to improve the quality of the questions is Bloom's Taxonomy. Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 and revised in 2001. This study compares the performance of the Support Vector Machine and Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes algorithms to classify quiz questions based on the cognitive level of Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. In this study, the dataset received two treatments in handling the imbalanced class. One dataset is using SMOTE method, and one another is not using any oversampling methods. The result shows that classification with oversampling datasets had better results than those without oversampling. The Support Vector Machine algorithm with SMOTE has the highest accuracy of 98%, rather than the Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes algorithm with SMOTE has an accuracy of 91%.

AB  - In the rapid development of artificial intelligence in the last several years, machine learning is the mainstream method to realize artificial intelligence. What people usually call machine learning can be equivalent to statistical learning, which requires big data and powerful computing power; This is a machine learning trend driven by data, using algorithms to get a model with clear parameters, ignoring causal reasoning and focusing on statistical data; The machine learning method lacking logical causal reasoning will greatly hinder the advancement of artificial intelligence; How knowledge-driven causal reasoning provides new ideas for artificial intelligence is a question worth thinking about for scholars of artificial intelligence. Factor space theory that emphasizes causal reasoning will provide a new perspective and thinking for the development of artificial intelligence.

AB  - Creativity is a central phenomenon in human life. World-famous scientists and artists are praised for their creative genius. Schools and universities seek to educate creativity in students and many employers want to hire creative personnel. However, the measurement of creativity is difficult up to the present day. Standard creativity tests typically require human expertise in the evaluation of test responses. This evaluation is often more time-intensive than taking the test itself. Moreover, creativity tests are still regularly conducted in a pen-and-paper format, rendering the data analysis all the more tedious. In this article, we propose a digital game for assessing creativity. It can be hosted online. The data analysis can be automated and conducted in real-time. The test is implemented as a tower defense game ("Immune Defense"). We submit that a video game constitutes a natural setting, as opposed to a formal testing scenario, and provides an opportunity to test real-life creativity. We use the game event data gathered during each round of the game to determine a player's creativity score. A study with 17 participants was performed to compare game-based creativity scores to scores obtained with a standard creativity test, the Alternative Uses Task. Our preliminary data validate the proposed approach.

AB  - Emotion is intrinsic to humans and consequently, emotion understanding is a key part of human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is becoming increasingly popular as a new research frontier in natural language processing (NLP) due to its ability to mine opinions from the plethora of publicly available conversational data on platforms such as Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and others. Moreover, it has potential applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis), education (understanding student frustration), and more. In Addition, ERC is also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an understanding of the user’s emotions. Catering to these needs calls for effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However, it is a difficult problem to solve because of several research challenges. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and shed light on recent research in this field. We also describe the drawbacks of these approaches and discuss the reasons why they fail to successfully overcome the research challenges in ERC.

AB  - Exponential technological expansion creates opportunities for competitive advantage by applying new data-oriented approaches to digital marketing practices. Machine learning (ML) can predict future developments and support decision-making by extracting insights from large amounts of generated data. This functionality greatly impacts and streamlines the strategic decision-making process of organizations. The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management. A framework consisting of enablers and a process map was developed to help organizations identify the opportunities and successfully execute projects that are oriented toward the deployment and adoption of the analytical ML tools in digital marketing.

AB  - Detection of unintentional islanding, defined as inadvertently separation of distributed generators (DGs) from the utility grid, is a major challenging issue for modern distribution networks. Islanding detection becomes problematic especially when the local generation matches or closely matches the local load. Therefore, there are strict requirements for accurate, fast, and reliable islanding detection of renewables and DG-based systems. Various islanding schemes have been proposed in the literature, which can be categorized as remote, local, and intelligent-classifier-based schemes. Recently, intelligent schemes have gained attention due to their superior properties and advantages relative to traditional approaches. This paper overviews the shift in research from traditional schemes to intelligent islanding schemes. It also highlights the major obstacles, challenges, advantages and disadvantages, and future research directions of intelligent schemes. In this study, the intelligent-classifier-based islanding detection schemes presented over the last decade are analyzed objectively and comprehensively from all aspects of islanding detection. This research further highlights feature selection schemes and the most common parameters used for islanding detection. Finally, based on a detailed and critical analysis, the findings and potential recommendations are presented.

AB  - Stroke is one of the prime reasons for paralysis throughout the world caused due to impaired nervous system and resulting in disability to move the affected body parts. Rehabilitation is the natural remedy for recovering from paralysis and enhancing the quality of life. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) controlled assistive technology is the new paradigm, providing assistance and rehabilitation for the paralysed. But, most of these devices are error prone and also hard to get continuous control because of the dynamic nature of the brain signals. Moreover, existing devices like exoskeletons brings additional burden on the patient and the caregivers and also results in mental fatigue and frustration. To solve these issues Artificial Muscle Intelligence with Deep Learning (AMIDL) system is proposed in this paper. AMIDL integrates user intentions with artificial muscle movements in an efficient way to improve the performance. Human thoughts captured using Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are transformed into body movements, by utilising microcontroller and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device. EEG signals are subjected to pre-processing, feature extraction and classification, before being passed on to the affected body part. The received EEG signal is correlated with the recorded artificial muscle movements. If the captured EEG signal falls below the desired level, the affected body part will be stimulated by the recorded artificial muscle movements. The system also provides a feature for communicating human intentions as alert message to caregivers, in case of emergency situations. This is achieved by offline training of specific gesture and online gesture recognition algorithm. The recognised gesture is transformed into speech, thus enabling the paralysed to express their feelings to the relatives or friends. Experiments were carried out with the aid of healthy and paralysed subjects. The AMIDL system helped to reduce mental fatigue, miss-operation, frustration and provided continuous control. The thrust of lifting the exoskeleton is also reduced by using light weight wireless electrodes. The proposed system will be a great communication aid for paralysed to express their thoughts and feelings with dear and near ones, thereby enhancing the quality of life.

AB  - The interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets, describing the membership and non-membership degrees from interval values, can address uncertain information, while the normal fuzzy number (NFN) can depict normal distribution information in anthropogenic activity and natural environment. By combining the advantages of both operations, in this study, we proposed the interval-valued Pythagorean normal fuzzy (IVPNF) sets by introducing the NFN into IVPF environment. Firstly, we defined the conception, the operational laws, score function, accuracy function of IVPNF sets. Secondly, we presented four information aggregation operators to aggregate IVPNF information, including the IVPNF weighted averaging (IVPNFWA) operator, IVPNF weighted geometric (IVPNFWG) operator, the generalized IVPNFWA operator, and the generalized IVPNFWG operator. In addition, we analyzed some desirable properties of monotonicity, commutativity, and idempotency for the proposed four operators. Finally, a numerical example on multi-attribute decision-making problem is given to verify the practicality of the proposed operators, and the comparative and sensitive analysis are used to show the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed approach.

AB  - Artificial intelligence can learn some concepts by analyzing sensory data similarly to humans. This paper explores how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn abstract concepts by analyzing tongue images based on concepts from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is a discipline that relies heavily on practitioner experience. A computer-aided method will be investigated that analyzes sensory data for TCM practitioners. This paper proposes capitalizing on deep learning techniques. A method called the conceptual alignment deep auto-encoder (CADAE) is proposed to analyze tongue images that represent different body constitution (BC) types, which are the underlying concepts in TCM. In the first step, CADAE encodes the images to a representation space; in the second step, it decodes the patterns. The experiments demonstrate that CADAE can learn effective representations of abstract concepts aligned with BC types by encoding the tongue images. Furthermore, the representation space of the hidden conceptual neurons can be visualized by a decoder network. The experiments also demonstrate that ANNs acquire different data perspectives when different loss functions are used for training. Numerous representation spaces of ANNs remain to be explored. To some extent, our exploration demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to learn some concepts in a manner similarly to human beings. Based on this ability, AI shows promise in helping humans form new effective concepts that can facilitate medical development and alleviate the burdens of medical practitioners.

The data is essential for electricity demand, generation and price forecasting, which plays an important role in making energy efficient decisions, and long and short term predictions regarding energy generation, consumption and storage. However, the forecasting accuracy decreases when data is used in raw form. Hence, data preprocessing is considered essential. This paper provides an overview of the data preprocessing methods and a detailed discussion of the methods used in the existing literature. A comparison of the methods is also given. A survey of closely related survey papers is also presented and the papers are compared based on their contributions. Moreover, based on the discussion of the data preprocessing methods, a narrative is built with a critical analysis. Finally, future research directions are discussed to guide the readers.

AB  - At present, pattern classification is one of the most important aspects of establishing machine intelligence systems for tackling decision-making processes. The fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network combines the operations of an artificial neural network and fuzzy set theory into a common framework. FMM is considered one of the most useful neural networks for pattern classification. This paper aims to 1) analyze the FMM neural network in terms of its impact in addressing pattern classification problems; 2) examine models that are proposed based on the original FMM model (i.e., existing FMM-based variants); 3) identify the challenges associated with FMM and its variants, and; 4) discuss future trends and make recommendations for improvement. The review is conducted based on a methodical protocol. Through a rigorous searching and filtering process, the relevant studies are extracted and comprehensively analyzed to adequately address the defined research questions. The findings indicate that FMM plays a critical role in providing solutions to pattern classification issues. The FMM model and a number of FMM-based variants are identified and systematically analyzed with respect to their aims, improvements introduced and results achieved. In addition, FMM and its variants are critically analyzed with respect to their benefits and limitations. This paper shows that the existing FMM-based variants still encounter issues in terms of the learning process (expansion, overlap test, and contraction), which influence the classification performance. Based on the review findings, research opportunities are suggested to propose a new model to enhance the number of existing FMM models, particularly in terms of their learning process by minimizing hyperbox overlap pertaining to different classes as well as avoiding membership ambiguity of the overlapped region. In short, this review provides a comprehensive and critical reference for researchers and practitioners to leverage FMM and its variants for undertaking pattern classification tasks.

AB  - The designers' tendency to adhere to a specific mental set and heavy emotional investment in their initial ideas often limit their ability to innovate during the design ideation process. The shrinking time-to-market and the growing diversity of users' needs further exacerbate this gap. Recent advances in deep generative models have created new possibilities to overcome the cognitive obstacles of designers through automated generation or editing of design concepts. This article explores the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for automated, attribute-aware generative design of the visual attributes of a product. Specifically, a design attribute GAN (DA-GAN) model is developed for automated generation of fashion product images with the desired visual attributes. Experiments on a large fashion dataset signify the potentials of GAN for attribute-aware generative design, verify the ability of editing attributes with relatively higher accuracy and uncover several key challenges and research questions for future work.
