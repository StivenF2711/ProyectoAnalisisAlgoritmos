AB  - In this paper, a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied for the first time to find a ferromagnetic core structure with optimal coupling coefficient between transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) coils of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. Since formula-based theoretical design is not available due to the non-linear magnetic field distortion stems from the presence of the ferromagnetic core in a WPT system, the proposed design has been achieved through finite element analysis (FEA) simulation-based data learning. The proposed design methods are so general that they can be applied to any conventional WPT coil types. We applied the proposed algorithm to the ferromagnetic core structure design of a simple dipole coil first. By training only 2.3 % data out of total possible cases, it is experimentally verified that the core structure obtained by the proposed method has a coupling coefficient 7 % higher than that of the example design level in the case of 98 cm distance between Tx and Rx coils.

AB  - Many approaches have been proposed to teach the basic concepts of big data and artificial intelligence to K-12 students based on block-based programming languages, such as Scratch. Using these approaches, young students can easily experience big data and artificial intelligence through a drag-and-drop approach. However, it remains difficult for them to perform more complex tasks, such as directly collecting data from the web or exploiting custom-made machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel Scratch extension that allows Scratch to communicate with text-based programming languages such as Python and JavaScript using WebSockets. Unlike other Scratch extensions, our extension greatly enhances the extensibility of Scratch given its use of “text-based visual blocks” so that messages can be freely exchanged through a minimum number of blocks. In order for students to use these blocks easily, the blocks are designed such that they can be used as if talking with a friend named “Tooee.” In order to show how this extension can help students create big data and artificial intelligence programs, we present eight example applications that students can easily implement. These are (1) Weather Forecast, (2) Top 5 Movies in Theaters, (3) COVID-19 Dashboard, (4) Saving Quiz Results to a CSV File, (5) Facial Image Classification, (6) Color Classification, (7) Object Classification, and (8) Handwriting Recognition. Our analyses and experimental results show that Tooee has several advantages over other educational environments.

AB  - Communication has become a lot easier in this era of technology, development of high-speed computer networks, and the inexpensive uses of Internet. Therefore, data transmission has become vulnerable to and unsafe from different external attacks. Every communication body wants to secure their data while communicating over the Internet. The internet has various benefits but the main demerit is the privacy and security and the transmission of data over insecure network or channel may happen. Various techniques used for secure communication in order to address these issues, steganography plays an important role. Steganography is the process of obfuscation that makes something incomprehensible and unclear. Different image steganography research methods are proposed recently but each has their advantages and disadvantages and still have necessity to develop some better image steganography mechanisms to achieve the reliability between the basics criteria of image steganography. Therefore, the proposed work, in this paper, is based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution method. The LSB substitution method can minimize the error rate in embedding process and can achieve greater reliability in criteria, using novel algorithm based on value difference. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique in steganography within the digital images such is RGB, Gray Scale, Texture, Aerial images to achieve higher security, imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness as compared with existing methods. The experimental outcomes of the suggested approach prove further developed strength and justify the feasibility of our research. Through numerical simulations, we observed that the proposed strategy outperformed the next-best current methodology by 5.561 percent in terms of PSNR Correlation score. Additionally, the proposed approach achieved a 6.43 percent better score in PSNR with a variable measure of code inserted in similar images with distinct dimensions. Furthermore, encrypting the same amount of information in images of varying sizes resulted in approximately 6.77 percent improvements. Embedding different sizes of a particular secret message in a different image (such as Gray, Texture, Aerial and RGB images) came out with about 5.466 percent of better score.

AB  - Terengganu brassware is a local craft product with high artistic value and traditional craftsmanship that involves a lot of creativity and elaborate artistry. This cultural heritage is in danger of disappearing because the current younger generation lacks interest, creativity and artistic skills to continue the craftsmanship. Therefore, gathering detailed knowledge of the craft from ageing practitioners can preserve the heritage. This article reports the study on brassware intangible heritage knowledge base development using an ontological approach. The ontology modelling used Ontology Development 101. Content validation result by experts found that the brassware ontology is complete, consistent, concise, precise and clear. Evaluation results show that the experts agreed on content representation (mean ≥3.80), and the ontology meets all the quality criteria (mean ≥4.03). The brassware craft ontology contributes to the intangible heritage preservation effort for one of the almost extinct local culture and practices. This intangible heritage knowledge base can be applied for the development of semantic search, mobile and gaming applications to attract and disseminate heritage information to young people. Additionally, the ontological design can serve as a guide for the design and development of a knowledge base for other types of heritage.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) personal assistant has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. Almost all existing AI personal assistants serve as service terminals to chat with human users for certain tasks. We are instead interested in building AI personal assistants for a different yet important dialog scenario, where they chat with people to fulfill specific tasks on behalf of their human users. As the personal assistants are playing a requester role, instead of a service terminal role, the conversation goal becomes delivering or requesting information according to specific user requests precisely and efficiently. The challenge for the conversation policy is that all user requests must be delivered precisely, while the challenge for the response generation is that it's generally expected for machine generated responses to cover multiple information slots, either requesting or delivering, to make the conversation efficient. In this paper, we present Table-to-Dialogue, a novel approach to address the above challenges when building a requester role AI personal assistant. We employ an encoder-decoder network to learn explicit conversation policy, which generates the corresponding information slots based on the conversation context and the user request table. We further integrate a novel Multi-Slot Constrained Bi-directional Decoder (MS-CBD) into the above encoder-decoder network, to generate machine response according to the multiple slot values and their intermediate representations from the policy decoder. Different from the existing single direction text decoder approaches, MS-CBD leverage the bi-directional context of the response when generating it to enhance the semantic coherence. The experiments shows that our approach significantly outperform the state-of-the-art conversation approaches on automatic and human evaluation metrics.

AB  - Gamified learning aims to motivate students using game elements. Although gamification can enhance students' enjoyment and engagement, it is unclear how different students behave in and interact with gamified contexts. To this end, we analyze how different students interact with a gamified course. We devised such an experimental course on Multimedia Content Production (MCP), and ran it for ten years. At each year, we modified it after students' feedback from the previous year. We determined student groups applying clustering techniques to learner performance data, independently analyzed the resulting clusters in terms of behavior, engagement, performance, and also compared those pairwise. Our analysis identified four different student groups (profiles/clusters) according to their performance and interactions with the course across all years. We found out that the best performing students were those that had significantly more interactions with course materials and consistently ranked highest. In addition, we found that performance indicators for students of all groups became stable within the first month after course start, allowing final grades to be predicted with high accuracy by then. Furthermore, all were deadline driven and became mainly active at the end of the semesters (indicating a lack of self-regulation skills). Moreover, we did not find any specific relation between students' groups and gaming profiles (Brainhex categories). Finally, we propose practical implications and guidelines for designing compelling gamified learning experiences.

AB  - An increase in the number of cloud services makes service selection a challenging issue for cloud users. It is important to determine the best service that can fulfill user requirements. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) model. The proposed method considers service measurement index cloud (SMICloud) structure for qualitative attributes of cloud services as well as user requirements based on fuzzy values to consider vague user requirements. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic are used to rank cloud services. Furthermore, a fuzzy Delphi filtering method is proposed to decrease the execution time of ranking cloud services. In experiments, different aspects such as accuracy, execution time, scalability, and sensitivity analysis are investigated. The results confirm that the proposed method outperforms available methods in terms of execution time and scalability. Furthermore, the experiments show that the proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 96%.

AB  - The growing demand for eliciting useful knowledge from data calls for techniques that can discover insights (in the form of patterns) that users need. Methodologies for describing intrinsic and relevant properties of data through the extraction of useful patterns, however, work on fixed input data, and the data representation, therefore, constrains the discovered insights. In this regard, this paper aims at providing foundations to make the descriptive knowledge that is extracted by pattern mining more user-centric by relying on flexible data structures defined on two different perspectives: concepts and data records. In this sense, items in data can be grouped into abstract terms through subjective hierarchies of concepts, whereas data records can also be organized based on the users' subjective perspective. A series of easy-to-follow toy examples are considered for each of the two perspectives to demonstrate the usefulness and necessity of the proposed foundations in pattern mining. Finally, aiming at experimentally testing whether classical pattern mining algorithms can be adapted to such flexible data structures, the experimental analysis comprises different methodologies, including exhaustive search, random search, and evolutionary approaches. All these approaches are based on well-known and widely recognized techniques to demonstrate the usefulness of the provided foundations for future research works and more efficient and specifically designed algorithms. Obtained insights demonstrate the importance of working with subjectivity: an item is a type of soda but belongs to a pack, including two or more soda types.

AB  - Scoliosis is a complicated spinal deformity, and millions of people are suffering from this disease worldwide. Early detection and accurate scoliosis assessment are vital for effective clinical management and patient outcomes. The Cobb Angle (CA) measurement is the most precise method for calculating scoliotic curvature, which plays an essential role in diagnosing and treating scoliosis. This letter has conducted a systematic review to analyze scoliosis detection by vertebra identification and CA estimation using the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The major scientific databases such as Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and IEEE Xplorer are explored, where 2017–2023 publications are considered. The article selection process is based on keywords like “Vertebra Identification,” “CA Estimation,” “Scoliosis Detection,” “Deep Learning (DL),” etc. After rigorous analysis, 413 articles are extracted, and 44 are identified for final consideration. Further, several investigations based on the previous work are discussed along with its Proposed Solutions (PS).

AB  - A high-stakes decision requires deep thought to understand the complex factors that stop a situation from becoming worse. Such decisions are carried out under high pressure, with a lack of information, and in limited time. This research applies Causal Artificial Intelligence to high-stakes decisions, aiming to encode causal assumptions based on human-like intelligence, and thereby produce interpretable and argumentative knowledge. We develop a Causal Bayesian Networks model based on causal science using  $d$ -separation and do-operations to discover the causal graph aligned with cognitive understanding. Causal odd ratios are used to measure the causal assumptions integrated with the real-world data to prove the proposed causal model compatibility. Causal effect relationships in the model are verified based on causal P-values and causal confident intervals and approved less than 1% by random chance. It shows that the causal model can encode cognitive understanding as precise, robust relationships. The concept of model design allows software agents to imitate human intelligence by inferring potential knowledge and be employed in high-stakes decision applications.

AB  - Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a popular technique of computer vision where the content of an image is blended with the style of another, which results in a fused image with certain properties of both original images. This approach has practical applications in various domains and has garnered significant attention in both industry and academia. An interesting application of this technique is segmented style transfer where a segmentation algorithm is used to locate objects within an image and then the style transfer method is performed locally, producing images with different styles for different objects. This approach opens up possibilities for creating visually striking compositions by seamlessly blending various artistic styles onto specific objects within an image, allowing for a new level of creative expression. This paper proposes a novel method that combines Segment Anything Model (SAM), a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based image segmentation model developed by Facebook, with style transfer. Our approach includes performing localized style transfer in selected segmentation regions of an image using classical style transfer algorithms. To ensure smooth transitions between the stylized and non-stylized border we also develop our loss function with a border smoothing technique. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, including the ability to infuse multiple artistic styles into different objects within an image. The contributions of this work include integrating SAM with style transfer, proposing a novel loss function, evaluating the segmented style transfer in multiple content regions, comparing with state-of-the-art approaches, and experimenting with multiple style images for diverse stylization. Our primary focus centers on creating a model that serves as a digital painter across a wide range of image genres and artistic styles.

AB  - The internet provides a very vast amount of sources of news and the user has to search for desirable news by spending a lot of time because the user always prefers their related interest, desirable and informative news. The clustering of the news article having a great impact on the preferences of the user. The unsupervised learning techniques such that K-means Clustering and Spectral Clustering are proposed to categorize the news articles by extracting discriminant features that help the user to search and get informative news without wasting time. The BBC news articles dataset is used to perform experiments that consist of 2225 news articles. The TF-IDF feature extraction technique is used with K-means clustering and Spectral clustering to get the most similar clusters to categorize the news articles in respective domains. Those domains are sports, tech, entertainment, politics, and business. The clustering algorithms are evaluated using adjusted rand index, V-measure, homogeneity score, completeness score, and Fowlkes mallows score. The experimental results illustrated that K-means clustering performs better than spectral clustering using the TF-IDF feature extraction approach. But to improve the results the canopy centroid selection is used with the grid search optimization technique to optimize the results of the Kmeans and named its as a K-Means using Grid Search based on Canopy (KMGC-Search). The experimental results shows the proposed approach can be used as a viable method for the categorization of news articles.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents a significant and growing public health challenge. This work concisely summarizes AD, encompassing its pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing research. The main goal of managing AD is to reduce symptoms while improving the lives of those impacted. This letter has conducted a systematic review to analyze the prediction of AD using the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The major scientific databases such as Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and IEEE Xplorer are explored, where 2018–2023 publications are considered. The article selection process is based on keywords like “Alzheimer’s disease,” “Brain Images,” “Deep Learning (DL),” etc. After rigorous analysis, 946 articles were extracted, and 42 were identified for final consideration. Further, several investigations based on the previous work are discussed along with its Proposed Solutions (PS). Finally, a case study on AD detection using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and AD Detection Network (ADD-NET) implementation is presented.

AB  - Planarity of crisp graphs is a well-established field, whereas planarity within a fuzzy framework has seen recent development and extensive exploration. In an  $m$ -polar fuzzy graph ( $m$ PFG), each node and edge is associated with  $m$ -components, connected through minimal relationships. However, if one desires to incorporate maximum, average, or other intermediate relationships between nodes and edges, the  $m$ PFG concept becomes inadequate as in the  $m$ -polar fuzzy model, only minimum relation is considered. To address this limitation, a generalized model of  $m$ PFG is introduced in this article, allowing for a broader range of relationships to be considered simultaneously. This paper also discusses the properties of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy environments and generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFGs), highlighting their isomorphism. Several significant findings and insights are presented in this paper. The article delves into the properties and characteristics of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy planar graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFPGs) and explores various intriguing aspects related to them. Additionally, a novel concept of a generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy dual graph ( $\text{G}m$ PFDG) is introduced, derived from  $\text{G}m$ PFPGs. The paper establishes a relationship between the dual of a  $\text{G}m$ PFG and  $\text{G}m$ PFG, examining their properties in the context of dual  $\text{G}m$ PFPGs. Lastly, the article discusses an illustrative example of a social group network problem assessing the group’s activity based on attributes such as cooperation, team spirit, awareness, controlling power, good behaviour, and creativity.

AB  - The utilization of semantic web technologies has led to the development of knowledge graphs represented as triples that allow for the exploration of specific and cross-domains. Despite the advantages of semantic links between entities in facilitating user exploration, they can also lead to an overwhelming number of exploration choices that can cause confusion, frustration, uncertainty, and a sense of being lost in the abundant graph, particularly for users who are not familiar with the domain. Thus, identifying exploration strategies is critical to improving user exploration and increasing exploration utility. This study aims to identify exploration strategies that promote knowledge utility (i.e., increase users’ domain knowledge) and exploration experience (i.e., provide users with a positive and pleasant feeling). To accomplish this goal, an experimental user study was conducted, involving lay users in the musical instrument domain, where they were presented with an exploration task and then allowed to freely explore musical instruments. Parameters related to exploration paths were used to analyze the exploration patterns that users follow during their exploration. The findings reveal exploration strategies that promote knowledge utility and exploration experience. This research contributes to the literature on intelligent methods of guiding user exploration through knowledge graphs to enhance exploration effectiveness, which can have broad applications in knowledge graph utilization.

AB  - Suicidal ideation detection is a vital research area that holds great potential for improving mental health support systems. However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation.

AB  - This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance the precision of wine quality assessment, focusing specifically on Portuguese red wine. Amidst the growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for sensory analysis, our research distinguishes itself by employing a rigorous methodological framework. Our approach, named the ‘Incremental Analysis of Baseline Accuracy,’ identifies the chemical variables most predictive of wine quality. This framework aims to streamline the predictive process by pinpointing key variables that significantly influence quality assessments. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that precisely determines the criticality of chemical inputs, both their exact values and their correct order, to identify which inputs significantly contribute to the quality assessment of a sensory perception, such as taste. The centerpiece of our paper is a vibrant 3D pie chart that illustrates the percentage criticality of different input variables for perceiving the quality of red wine. This chart symbolizes the essence of our paper: a ‘pie’ representing the empirical conclusion, not mere conjecture. Through this paper, we have shown that it is possible to quantify a qualitative, perceptual aspect like taste perception, which is often believed to be assessable only through subjective conjecture. Moreover, our findings, facilitated by the Incremental Analysis of the Baseline Accuracy method, demonstrate that this perception can be systematically quantified, challenging traditional assumptions about sensory analysis.

AB  - The study aims to improve the daily teaching level of the school and make students enjoy better teaching methods. Firstly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) are deeply studied through information technology (IT). Secondly, the calculation methods based on the IoT and DL are analyzed, through which the research model is constructed. Finally, a digital teaching platform is established through the research model to conduct a real-time statistical survey of students and teachers. The results show that students are leading in the daily teaching process. According to the survey results, most students spend 3 to 4 hours in daily extra-curricular learning; 45% of them acquire knowledge mainly through classroom learning, and 23% through online learning. Their main difficulty in learning is learning ability, accounting for 48%. Moreover, it is an energy problem, accounting for 28%. 64% of students are passive learning, far more than 37% of active learning students. This study combines multiple fields across disciplines, such as IT, IoT, and DL. Digital art teaching platforms usually focus on creativity and performance, and combining IoT and DL can provide art students with a more personalized, real-time teaching experience, and promote the cross-application of digital art and cutting-edge technologies.

AB  - This study aims to explore the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in art education, assessing its impact on learners’ experiences and learning outcomes. The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80% satisfaction and 90% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education. This study expands the field of art education by integrating IoT and GANs, enhancing students’ creative experiences, and providing innovative methods for art teaching in the digital age.

AB  - The incidence of depressive disorder in Korea is the highest among OECD countries. The proportion of patients in their 20s is the highest. However, social gaze and false perception are causing problems such as not visiting the hospital or delaying the visit. Accordingly, we suggest a Korean model for predicting depressive disorders using data from online communities widely used by people in their 20s. In many countries, including South Korea, depressive disorders are diagnosed using DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) published by the American Psychiatric Association. We propose a model that predicts the probability of a user’s speech corresponding to nine criteria for diagnosing DSM-5 depressive disorder, following advice obtained through periodic meetings with a psychiatrist. The prediction performance was improved by using the correlation between each criterion in the model implementation stage.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an innovative tool able to enrich cultural and creative spots (gems, hereinafter) extracted from the European Commission Cultural Gems portal, by suggesting relevant keywords (tags) and YouTube videos (represented with proper thumbnails). On the one hand, the system queries the YouTube search portal, selects the videos most related to the given gem, and extracts a set of meaningful thumbnails for each video. On the other hand, each tag is selected by identifying semantically related popular search queries (i.e., trends). In particular, trends are retrieved by querying the Google Trends platform. A further novelty is that our system suggests contents in a dynamic way. Indeed, as for both YouTube and Google Trends platforms the results of a given query include the most popular videos/trends, such that a gem may constantly be updated with trendy content by periodically running the tool. The system has been tested on a set of gems and evaluated with the support of human annotators. The results highlighted the effectiveness of our proposal.

AB  - Smart spaces are physical environments equipped with sensors, actuators, and other computing devices to gather data and provide intelligent services to users. These spaces are made possible by ubiquitous computing, particularly context-aware computing. Although these systems are mainly implemented on mobile and other resource-constrained wearable devices, different techniques have been adopted for their implementation. Rule-based reasoning is a relatively easy-to-implement approach that can solve real-world problems. Rule-based systems rely on a set of assertions that constitute the working memory and a set of rules that govern what should be done with the set of assertions. Despite its relative simplicity, the working memory size is a critical factor in developing these systems, particularly for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose techniques for efficiently calculating the working memory size. Our results show that all three techniques, DWM, APS, and SAPS, performed well in different ways. However, APS and SAPS consumed from 25% to 100% less memory than existing techniques.

AB  - This study is devoted to exploring the strategy of automatic sketch generation and optimization of industrial design based on deep learning. By combining the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an innovative method to realize the automatic generation of high-quality and diverse industrial design sketches. In the experiment, this paper selects SketchyCAD and other public data sets, trains them through deep learning model, and introduces genetic algorithm(GA) and differential evolution algorithm to optimize the parameters. In terms of experimental results, we observed that the quality of generated sketches was significantly improved, and the design sketches generated by the mode (GAN+GA) were more realistic and innovative. The introduction of optimization strategy further improves the generation effect and intelligently adjusts the model parameters to adapt to different design styles. In this paper, the influence of hyperparameter tuning is analyzed in detail, and it is found that the adjustment of learning rate plays a key role in generating quality and diversity. However, the experiment also revealed some challenges and room for improvement. We noticed that the generated results may have the risk of over-fitting in the training process, and with the increase of training times, the diversity gradually decreased. This suggests that more complex model structure and richer data sets are needed to improve the generalization performance. Generally speaking, this study provides new ideas and methods for the integration of deep learning and industrial design. By innovatively combining generation model and optimization algorithm, this research has contributed beneficial research results to the development of industrial design automation. This research is of great significance to promote the intelligence and innovation in the field of industrial design.

AB  - A novel approach was proposed to develop a composition generation system for creating note sequences representing question-and-answer phrases (QAPs) in melodic phrases. Using a small dataset containing fewer than 10 compositions, the system is expected to generate new melodies that extend beyond the limitations of the original dataset. The modeling of note sequence data and selecting appropriate notes in specific sequences within the melody were chosen for gamelan skeletal melody generation using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method. Gamelan, a traditional musical ensemble from Java, was selected as the focus of this research, with experiments centered on the gamelan skeletal melody, which plays a role similar to chord progressions in Western music. The evaluation was conducted by statistically analyzing the sequence of notations generated from the dataset and through expert testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate compositions with well-formed melodic phrases through a small dataset containing varying lengths, data mapping, feature selection based on QAP patterns, and GA. GA can enhance creativity in creating note sequences and new QAP patterns, including novel patterns.

AB  - This study aims to explore the application of deep learning models in multi-track music generation to enhance the efficiency and quality of music production. Considering the limited capability of traditional methods in extracting and representing audio features, a multi-track music generation model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Transformer network is proposed. This model first utilizes the BERT model to encode and represent music data, capturing semantic and emotional information within the music data. Subsequently, the encoded music features are inputted into the Transformer network to learn the temporal relationships and structural patterns among music sequences, thereby generating new multi-track music compositions. The performance of this model is evaluated, revealing that compared to other algorithms, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 95.98% in music generation prediction, with an improvement in precision by 4.77%. Particularly, the model demonstrates significant advantages in predicting pitch of music tracks. Hence, the multi-track music generation model proposed in this study exhibits excellent performance in accuracy and pitch prediction, offering valuable experimental reference for research and practice in the field of multi-track music generation.

AB  - There is evidence that a user’s subjective confidence in an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system is crucial in its use, even more decisive than the objective effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Therefore, different methods have been proposed for analyzing confidence in AI. In our research, we set out to evaluate how the degree of perceived trust in an AI system could affect a user’s final decision to follow AI recommendations. To this end, we established trustworthy criteria that such an evaluation should meet by following a co-creation approach with a multidisciplinary group of 10 experts. After a systematic review of 3,204 articles, we found that none of the tools met the inclusion criteria. Thus, we introduce the so-called “Perceived Operational Trust Degree in AI” (POTDAI) tool that is based on the findings from the expert group and the literature analysis, with a methodology that adds rigor to that employed previously to create similar evaluation tools. We propose a short questionnaire for quick and easy application, inspired by the original version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with six Likert-type items. In this way, we also respond to the need pointed out by authors such as Vorm and Combs to extend the TAM to address questions related to user perception in systems with an AI component. Thus, POTDAI can be used alone or in combination with TAM to obtain additional information on its usefulness and ease of use.

AB  - A total of 34% of AI research and development projects fail or are abandoned, according to a recent survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870 companies. In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top  $n$  potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company’s risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers.

AB  - With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, a variety of high-performance end-to-end driving models (E2EDMs) are being proposed. In order to understand the computational methods of E2EDMs, pixel-level explanations methods are used to obtain the explanations of the E2EDMs. However, little attention has been paid to the excellence of the explanations of E2EDMs. Therefore, in order to build trustworthy E2EDMs, we focus on improving the persuasibility of the explanations of E2EDMs. We propose an object-level explanation method (main approach) for E2EDMs, which masks the objects in the image and then treats the change in the prediction result as the importance of the objects, then we explain the E2EDM by the importance of each object. To further validate the effectiveness of object-level explanations, we propose another approach (validation approach), which trains E2EDMs with object information as input and generates the importance of objects using general explanation methods. Both approaches generate object-level explanations, in order to compare these object-level explanations with traditional pixel-level explanations, we propose experimental methods to measure the persuasibility of explanations of E2EDMs through a subjective and objective method. The subjective method evaluates persuasibility based on the extent to which participants think the importance of features indicated by the explanations is correct. The objective method evaluates the persuasibility based on the human annotation similarity between provided with only the important part of images and provided with the complete images. The experimental results show that the object-level explanations are more persuasive than the traditional pixel-level explanations.

AB  - The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enjoying unprecedented success and is dramatically transforming the landscape of the financial services industry. However, there is a strong need to develop an accountability and explainability framework for AI in financial services, based on a risk-based assessment of appropriate explainability levels and techniques by use case and domain. This paper proposes a risk management framework for the implementation of AI in banking with consideration of explainability and outlines the implementation requirements to enable AI to achieve positive outcomes for financial institutions and the customers, markets and societies they serve. The work presents the evaluation of three algorithmic approaches (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Type 2 Fuzzy Logic with evolutionary optimisation) for nine banking use cases. We review the emerging regulatory and industry guidance on ethical and safe adoption of AI from key markets worldwide and compare leading AI explainability techniques. We will show that the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic models deliver very good performance which is comparable to or lagging marginally behind the Neural Network models in terms of accuracy, but outperform all models for explainability, thus they are recommended as a suitable machine learning approach for use cases in financial services from an explainability perspective. This research is important for several reasons: (i) there is limited knowledge and understanding of the potential for Type-2 Fuzzy Logic as a highly adaptable, high performing, explainable AI technique; (ii) there is limited cross discipline understanding between financial services and AI expertise and this work aims to bridge that gap; (iii) regulatory thinking is evolving with limited guidance worldwide and this work aims to support that thinking; (iv) it is important that banks retain customer trust and maintain market stability as adoption of AI increases.

AB  - Integrated and collaborative manufacturing system develops as massive data are obtained by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, the “trust tax” imposed on manufacturers during their countless collaborations with customers, suppliers, distributors, governments, service providers, and other manufacturers is very high. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can lead to more transparent, secure, and efficient transactions. It represents a new paradigm, as well as new thinking, of how data can be securely stored, integrated, and communicated among different stakeholders, organizations, and systems that unnecessarily trust each other. Blockchain is greatly useful for reducing the “trust tax,” especially beneficial for the small- and medium-sized enterprises that must tolerate much heavier trust tax than the established manufacturers. This paper investigates the blockchain-based security and trust mechanism and elaborates a particular application of blockchain for quality assurance, which is one of the strategic priorities of smart manufacturing. Data generated in a smart manufacturing process can be leveraged to retrieve material provenance, facilitate equipment management, increase transaction efficiency, and create a flexible pricing mechanism. The dairy industry is used to instantiate the value propositions of blockchain for quality assurance.

AB  - The brain-computer interface (BCI) connects the brain and the external world through an information transmission channel by interpreting the physiological information of the brain during thinking activities. The effective classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is the key to improving the performance of the system. To improve the classification accuracy of EEG signals in the BCI system, the transfer learning algorithm and the improved Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm are combined to construct a data classification model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that in actual and imagined movements, the accuracy of the left- and right-hand movements at different speeds is higher than when the speeds are the same. The proposed Adaptive Composite Common Spatial Pattern (ACCSP) and Self Adaptive Common Spatial Pattern (SACSP) algorithms have good classification effects on 5 subjects, with an average classification accuracy rate of 83.58 percent, which is an increase of 6.96 percent compared with traditional algorithms. When the training sample size is 10, the classification accuracy of the ACCSP algorithm is higher than that of the traditional CSP algorithm. The improved CSP algorithm combined with transfer learning embodies a good classification effect in both ACCSP and SACSP. Especially, the performance of SACSP mode is better. Combining the improved CSP algorithm proposed with the CSP-based transfer learning algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of the BCI classifier.

AB  - Sentiment analysis of social media data consists of attitudes, assessments, and emotions which can be considered a way human think. Understanding and classifying the large collection of documents into positive and negative aspects are a very difficult task. Social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram provide a platform in order to gather information about people's sentiments and opinions. Considering the fact that people spend hours daily on social media and share their opinion on various different topics helps us analyze sentiments better. More and more companies are using social media tools to provide various services and interact with customers. Sentiment Analysis (SA) classifies the polarity of given tweets to positive and negative tweets in order to understand the sentiments of the public. This paper aims to perform sentiment analysis of real-time 2019 election twitter data using the feature selection model word2vec and the machine learning algorithm random forest for sentiment classification. Word2vec with Random Forest improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis significantly compared to traditional methods such as BOW and TF-IDF. Word2vec improves the quality of features by considering contextual semantics of words in a text hence improving the accuracy of machine learning and sentiment analysis.

AB  - Despite the tremendous growth of the transportation sector, the availability of systems that ensure safe, efficient, sustainable transportation reduces traffic congestion, maintenance costs, the off-road time of the vehicle, enhances driver’s experiences, and ensures a more reliable journey are very limited. The fast evolution of our economy, lack of driver training, and the grown affordability of our society are reasons for this mismatch in developing economies. We think that the inconsistency will increase and unfavorably affect our traffic structure unless intelligent algorithm-based solutions are developed and deployed. This article presents a system for providing safe, accurate, comfortable, reliable, fuel-efficient, and economical driving behavior using Machine Learning techniques like the hidden Markov model (HMM). Our proposed system recommends subsequent trips using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique for the driver. It provides suggestions concerning speed limits and alerts based on the driver’s behavior score and fuel efficiency. We used a publicly available UAH-DriveSet dataset captured by the driving monitoring app DriveSafe for all of our experiments. The results reveal that the proposed model predicts behavior with 95% accuracy and calculates fuel efficiency to improve driving quality and experience. This system recommends safer, more comfortable, more reliable, more efficient, and economical rides, beneficial for everyone in our society.

AB  - Recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved excellent performance in computer vision, but recent researches show that they're very vulnerable to adversarial examples, which results security risks to practical applications of CNN. Research on the generation algorithm of adversarial examples is conducive to evaluate the robustness of CNNs and promotes the study of defense algorithm. Although existing attack algorithms have achieved good performance in white-box manner, they behave unsatisfactorily in black-box manner. In this paper, we propose the mini-batch gradient based iterative method which could dramatically improve the attack ability in black-box manner. The previous iterative methods such as Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) always make the generated adversarial examples fall into over-fitting, however we use minibatch gradient information to help them jump out of the local minimum. Moreover, the proposed method can also be considered as self-ensemble or implicit ensemble attack thus have a stronger attack power. The parallel randomization layer plays core role for providing the mini-batch gradient and the implement of it is very simple since there are no trainable variables. In order to further improve the attack success rate, we combined the momentum and the proposed method. We conducted several experiments on seven networks and the highest success rate of black-box attack has reached 94.1%, which is close to the whitebox manner. Since the proposed method greatly improve the transferability of adversarial examples, we think it could help evaluate the robustness of various deep networks.

Using classical search engines or recommender systems in digital libraries, some interesting and relevant articles could be missed if they do not contain the same search key-phrases that the researcher is aware of. We propose a novel model that is based on a supervised active learning over a semantic features transformation of all articles of a given digital library. Our model, named Semantic Search-by-Examples (SSbE), shows better evaluation results over a similar purpose existing method, More-Like-This query, based on the feedback annotation of two domain experts in our experimented use-case. We also introduce a new semantic relatedness evaluation measure to avoid the need of human feedback annotation after the active learning process. The results also show higher diversity and overlapping with related scientific topics which we think can better foster transdisciplinary research.

AB  - There are many open challenges and current / future research directions for self-aware systems. We have shown that self-modeling systems address many of them, but we have not yet seen many replicable experiments that allow methods and results to be shared. In this paper, we describe an architecture for self-modeling systems, and how we expect to use it for experiments in self-awareness. These experiments support a system development and verification process that extends from system conception / definition time through run time operation.Self-Modeling, like Self-Awareness, is an approach to reach a goal, not an end in itself. The goal is survivability in difficult environments, and as much operational competence as possible. We think that run-time models are a minimum necessity for significant self-awareness, and our architecture makes significant use of them throughout.The theme for this paper: this is a beginning description of a reference architecture for a software controlled system that allows / encourages infrastructure analysis and performance prediction. It facilitates the evaluation of design choices at system definition time, so we can then specialize it to the expected run-time environment and specified run-time behavior constraints without losing the capability to "re-specialize" the architecture when the environmental conditions change.

AB  - This paper is about some difficult issues in systems of systems engineering, especially when the systems are self-modeling. The questions are about which of the available participant systems have the collection of capabilities desired, how to use them to provide those capabilities, and how to avoid introducing new error modes that emerge from the interaction. In this paper, we describe the process of designing and constructing a system of systems, starting with a provided mapping from the perceived need to a coordinated set of system capabilities that can address that need, some of which are missing capabilities for which new systems are needed. The system engineering aspects of this problem are difficult: the available information about the component system capabilities is always incomplete and often inconsistent, and there can be only approximations of the range of environmental behaviors. For these applications, the design will have to change as the environmental conditions change. These systems are in “continual dynamic development”, which is why we think the systems should manage and perform the integration tasks themselves. This paper shows one way to do that.

AB  - Blockchain technology presents benefits that change the way business partners interact. This new way of establishing democratic trust encourages business owners to think differently. Disaster relief and aid industries are built on the power of collaborating participants. A very high number of participants in different hierarchies, including donors, charities, disaster victims, insurance companies and government agencies interact under extraordinary circumstances of a disaster and hard times. Establishing a new way of trust brings forward a better disaster recovery. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based ecosystem. The blockchain-based disaster recovery not only would enhance the basic processes around disaster relief, but also promote the willingness of help by transparency and potential fraud prevention. This new blockchain system introduces an opportunity to be more resilient, to react rapidly, to communicate transparently, and to include new contributors such as IoT.

AB  - The present paper studies the notions of turn management and topic orientation, and more specifically, a group of pragmatic elements, so-called discourse markers (DMs) which indicate the act of next speaker selection, turn-keeping, topic elaboration and digression. After definitions of discourse marker, turn, floor control types/turn segments, topical units and actions are provided, a list of verbal and nonverbal discourse markers will be given, and they will be grouped into subclasses on the basis of the meaning relations between the linked discourse segments and the type of floor control and thematic control affected. The fundamental question is if discourse markers are key indicators of discourse structure and can be used in the automatic interpretation of utterance meaning and rhetoric relations. The goal of the paper is twofold: firstly, to identify how nonverbal behavior (gestures, posture, gaze) may help disambiguate the actual function(s) of a discourse marker in a given context; secondly, to make explicit how different modalities work together in a synchronized manner in turn regulation and topic control during cooperative interaction. It is examined in twenty spontaneous dialogues of the Hungarian HuComTech multimodal corpus what roles and functions verbal and nonverbal discourse markers play in indicating discourse structure and coherence relations. Concordances and corpus queries presented address both the verbal and nonverbal features of different turn management behavior and topical actions accompanied or supported by discourse markers. Taking a semasiological approach, some of the controversial defining features of discourse markers generally listed in the literature will be tested on a few Hungarian discourse markers: hát (‘well’), tehát (‘so’), mondjuk (‘say’), amúgy (‘otherwise’), egyébként (‘by the way’), szerintem (‘I think’). The features in question regard their position (turn-initiality, topic unit-initiality) as well as the genre-specificity and gender-specificity of their use.

AB  - The requirement of explainability is gaining more and more importance in Artificial Intelligence applications based on Machine Learning techniques, especially in those contexts where critical decisions are entrusted to software systems (think, for example, of financial and medical consultancy). In this paper, we propose an Argumentation-based methodology for explaining the results predicted by Machine Learning models. Argumentation provides frameworks that can be used to represent and analyse logical relations between pieces of information, serving as a basis for constructing human tailored rational explanations to a given problem. In particular, we use extension-based semantics to find the rationale behind a class prediction.

AB  - This paper reviews the interplay between biology and control theory as a typical example of transdisciplinary knowledge integration. Control is a fundamental function of the living organism that works in all aspects of the life. Various control mechanisms are ubiquitously built-in at all levels of body structures of living organisms and work all the time to support the life. They are diversely different from one to another with different material bases and structures, but there are many reasons to think that have some common ground and design principles. It is argued that a unified approach is exploited by focusing on a biological way of dealing with environmental changes to investigate various control mechanisms of living organisms.The notion of compound control is proposed as a common principle of biological control based on the transdisciplinary nature of control theory.

AB  - Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have been proposed as a viable solution to solving the communication problem in multicore systems. In this new setup, mapping multiple applications on available computational resources leads to interaction and contention at various network resources. Consequently, taking into account the traffic characteristics becomes of crucial importance for performance analysis and optimization of the communication infrastructure, as well as proper resource management. Although queuing-based approaches have been traditionally used for performance analysis purposes, they cannot properly account for many of the traffic characteristics (e.g., non-stationarity, self-similarity) that are crucial for multicore platform design. To overcome these limitations, we propose a statistical physics inspired approach to capture the traffic dynamics in multicore systems. As shown later in this paper, this is of fundamental significance for re-thinking the very basis of multicore systems design; it also opens up new research directions into NoC optimization which require accurate models of time-dependent and space-dependent traffic behavior.

AB  - Computer science (CS) is becoming an increasingly diverse domain. This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.

AB  - The development of keyword spotting (KWS) systems that are accurate in noisy conditions remains a challenge. Towards this goal, in this paper we propose a novel training strategy relying on multi-condition training for noise-robust KWS. By this strategy, we think of the state-of-the-art KWS models as the composition of a keyword embedding extractor and a linear classifier that are successively trained. To train the keyword embedding extractor, we also propose a new (CN,2+1)-pair loss function extending the concept behind related loss functions like triplet and N-pair losses to reach larger inter-class and smaller intra-class variation. Experimental results on a noisy version of the Google Speech Commands Dataset show that our proposal achieves around 12% KWS accuracy relative improvement with respect to standard end-to-end multi-condition training when speech is distorted by unseen noises. This performance improvement is achieved without increasing the computational complexity of the KWS model.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning has spread rapidly, and deeper, larger models have been proposed. However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods. The results show that the student model obtained by the proposed method gives higher performance than the conventional knowledge distillation methods.

AB  - Full paper. One of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. To ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers' expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. In-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. Two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. With these aspects in mind the Educational Pyramid Scheme (EPS) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an Erasmus Plus project. It is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. It is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. The transaction content of the Educational Pyramid Scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. According to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. The EPS contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). The motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. The training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. This paper describes the development of the EPS and its first implementation in the framework of the Austrian mandatory curriculum "Basic Digital Education" including computational thinking and programming. It presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the EPS.

AB  - We describe basic research that uses a causal, uncertainty-sensitive computational model rooted in qualitative social science to fuse disparate pieces of threat information. It is a cognitive model going beyond rational-actor methods. Having such a model has proven useful when information is uncertain, fragmentary, indirect, soft, conflicting, and even deceptive. Inferences from fusion must then account for uncertainties about the model, the credibility of information, and the fusion methods - i.e. we must consider both structural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties. We use a novel combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2) alternative models and model structures, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic combination, variants of Bayesian inference, and a new entropy-maximizing approach. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that such an analytically flexible and model-based approach to fusion can simultaneously enrich thinking, enhance threat detection, and reduce harmful false alarms.

AB  - In this article, we propose a computationally and communicationally efficient approach for decision-making in nonequilibrium stochastic games. In particular, due to the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose nonequilibrium strategies, we construct two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning. In the first model, named level- $k$  thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, a level-recursive algorithm and a level-paralleled algorithm are constructed, where the latter one can have an overall reduced computational complexity. To further reduce the complexity in the communication layer, modifications of the proposed nonequilibrium strategies are presented, which do not require the action of a boundedly rational agent to be updated at each step of the stochastic game. Simulations are performed that demonstrate our results.

AB  - The k-core of a graph is the largest induced sub-graph with minimum degree k. The problem of k-core decomposition finds the k-cores of a graph for all valid values of k, and it has many applications such as network analysis, computational biology and graph visualization. Currently, there are two types of parallel algorithms for k-core decomposition: (1) degree-based vertex peeling, and (2) iterative h-index refinement. There is, however, few studies on accelerating k-core decomposition using GPU. In this paper, we propose a highly optimized peeling algorithm on a GPU, and compare it with possible implementations on top of think-like-a-vertex graph-parallel GPU systems as well as existing serial and parallel k-core decomposition algorithms on CPUs. Extensive experiments show that our GPU algorithm is the overall winner in both time and space. Our source code is released at https://github.com/akhlaqueak/KCoreGPU.

AB  - Filled pauses (or fillers) are the most common form of speech disfluencies and they can be recognized as hesitation markers (“um”, “uh” and “er”) made by speakers, usually to gain extra time while thinking their next words. Filled pauses are very frequent in spontaneous speech. Their detection is therefore rather important for two basic reasons: (a) their existence influences the performance of individual components, like Automatic Speech Recognition system (ASR), in human-machine interaction and (b) their frequency can characterize the overall speech quality of a particular speaker, as it can be strongly associated with the speaker's confidence. Despite that, only limited work has been published for the detection of filled pauses in speech, especially through audio. In this work, we propose a framework for filled pause detection using both audio and textual information. For the audio modality, we transfer knowledge from a plethora of supervised tasks, such as emotion or speaking rate, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the text modality, we develop a temporal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method that takes into account textual information derived from an ASR system. In addition, the proposed transfer learning approach for the audio classifier leads to better results when benchmarked on our internal dataset for which the text is not transcribed but estimated by an ASR system. In this case, a simple late fusion approach boosts the performance even further. This proves that the audio approach is suitable for real-world applications where the transcribed text is not available and has to leverage imperfect ASR results, or even the absence of textual information (to reduce computational cost).

AB  - Accurate identification of cell types is a pivotal and intricate task in scRNA-seq data analysis. Recently, significant strides have been made in cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data using pre-trained language models (PLMs). This method has surmounted the constraints of conventional approaches regarding precision, robustness, and generalization. However, the fine-tuning process of large-scale pre-trained models incurs substantial computational expenses. To tackle this issue, a promising avenue of research has emerged, proposing parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for PLMs. These techniques concentrate on fine-tuning only a small portion of the model parameters while attaining comparable performance. In this study, we extensively research parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for scRNA-seq cell type annotation, employing scBERT as the backbone. We scrutinize the performance and compatibility of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methodologies across multiple datasets. Through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in cell type annotation. Hopefully, this study can inspire new thinking in analyzing scRNA-seq data.

AB  - Mind is all mankind's spiritual activities, including emotion, will, perception, consciousness, representation, learning, memory, thinking, intuition, etc. Mind model is for explaining what individuals operate in the cognitive process for something in the real world. It is the internal sign or representation for external realistic world. If the neural network is a hardware of the brain system, then the mind model is the software of the brain system. The key issue in intelligence science is to construct the mind model of the brain system, which will guide the development of brain-like computer in engineering through structure, dynamics, function and behavioral reverse engineering of the brain. This paper will discuss the computational model of memory and consciousness in the mind model named Consciousness And Memory model(CAM).

AB  - Modeling and simulation of physiological processes deal with the challenges of multiscale models in which coupling is very high within and among scales. Information technology approaches together with related analytical and computational tools will help to deal with these challenges. Physiological Model Simulation, Integration and Modeling Framework, Phy-SIM, provides the modeling environment which will help to cultivate various approaches to deal with the inherent problem of multiscale modeling of physiological systems. In this paper, we present the modular design of Phy-SIM. The proposed layered design of Phy-SIM, separates structure from function in physiological processes advocating modular thinking in developing and integrating physiological models. Moreover, the ontology based architecture will improve the modeling process by the mechanisms to attach anatomical and physiological ontological information to the models. The ultimate aim of the proposed approaches is to enhance the physiological model development and integration processes by providing the tools and mechanisms in Phy-SIM.

AB  - The information society places requirements on the profile of graduates, what is unreachable in the inertial education system. We aim for key changes in STEM education at primary and secondary schools through a national wide-impact project IT Academy. Active learning focusing on conceptual understanding and development of selected inquiry skills, together with formative assessment, form our didactic basis for innovation. The development of scientific literacy and computational thinking are also stimulated by changes in the content of science and mathematics curricula. We create a strong link to informatics concepts and practical use of informatics in everyday life, study, work and research. We expect the interest of young people to study computer science and STEM will increase. In this paper, we introduce key concepts of STEM education innovation, with examples of educational activities. The results of the pilot verification are formulated in recommendations to the educational professionals.

AB  - Large-scale graph analysis or also called network analysis of networks is supported by different algorithms, among the most relevant are PageRank (Web page ranking), Betweenness centrality (centrality in a graph) and Community Detection, these by of their complexity and the large amount of data that process diverse applications, increasingly need to use computational resources such as processor, memory and storage, for these reasons, it is necessary to apply high performance computing or HPC (High Performance Computing) but it would not be useful to apply HPC without having designed these algorithms in parallel programming, in this part there have been many studies on its application and methodologies to do it. The purpose of this work is to create a framework that allows computer science students to abstract a computer system based on the parallel programming paradigm, which implies that students to get acquainted with the resolution of algorithmic problems in a more natural way and away from the typical sequential thinking., The development of a graph analysis design pattern oriented to parallel programming in HPC, complemented with the design of didactic learning techniques in the network such as laboratories and/or simulators are key in the development of this framework.

AB  - It is one of humanity’s greatest needs today to be able to transmit electric current using power lines from power plants to cities, Therefore, power generation companies are always thinking about improving power transmission lines. As a result of pollution sitting on electrical insulators and making them conductive, power lines lose most of their power. Therefore, we need more effective and newer methods to wash these pollutions from electrical insulators. In this article, the cleaning of electrical insulators using a fiber laser by a hexarotor has been investigated. The control of these systems is done either by a pilot at the ground station or by an autopilot. The steps involved in construction and the parts described. Solidworks flow simulatin was used to simulate the effect of wind at a height of 50 meters near the power tower using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

AB  - One of the applications of machine learning with the most potential is speeding up expensive computational processes, i.e. learning to think. To do so, one first generates a large-scale dataset by a compute-intensive process and then trains a model to approximate the distribution. High performance computing (HPC) is a perfect fit for these processes, as one may efficiently deploy large amounts of computation to generate a dataset in a reasonable amount of time, to then learn a computationally-efficient solution. Here, we focus on generating a program synthesis dataset. Finding the program that fits a given input-output specification is very expensive, but generating the input-output pairs for a given program is a well-defined process. In this work, we show how we efficiently ran hundreds of thousands of C++ codes line-by-line and used intermediate variable states to generate a large-scale program synthesis dataset.

AB  - Computer Science 1 (CS1) courses introduce undergraduate students to computational thinking and their first programming language. As in most institutions, CS1 is a challenge for students at the University of Brasilia, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors.

AB  - This paper proposed an innovative method for aesthetic education by integrating shape grammar and neuroaesthetics. Aesthetic education can be divided into bottom-up aesthetic cultivation and top-down knowledge education, which correspond to the characteristics of shape grammar and neuroaesthetics, respectively. In this study, we redefined the state space of traditional shape grammar by replacing the computer-dominated label set with the affective-dominated emotion set of neuroaesthetics. This resulted in a neuroaesthetic shape grammar that is led by the designer and complementary to human intuition and algorithmic logic. We validated this method through practical design cases in the field of aesthetic education.

AB  - From an engineering point-of-view, cognitive control is inspired by the prefrontal cortex of the human brain; cognitive control may therefore be viewed as the overarching function of a cognitive dynamic system. In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional  \(Q\) -learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.

AB  - Today's systems require a higher consideration for the non functional requirement as security and dependability. Developers have to handle these requirements during software development lifecycle. To provide developers with security guidelines, security patterns were proposed. These patterns are a collection of expert's security knowledge and a good solution to convey security concepts. In order to encourage developers to take advantage from security solutions proposed by security patterns, we think that it is necessary to provide an appropriate mechanism to implement those patterns using UML profiles. In this paper, we propose structured UML profiles construction process based on security patterns. An illustration of the proposed profile construction process is provided using the active replication pattern. A case study of GPS system is also provided to demonstrate the application of generated UML profile using the proposed process.

AB  - Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is one of the trusted methods in the field of medicine. CAD system assists the doctors for the diagnosis of diseases in higher degree of perfection within a short period of time. Now CAD is the most preferable method for the initial diagnosis of cancer using X-ray, CT, mammogram or MRI images. CAD works as an intermediate in between the radiologist and the input images. The output from CAD doesn't think about as a final result however used as a reference for more tests in the relevant field. In fact CAD helps the doctors for detection of cancer more precisely and early. The combination of artificial intelligence, digital image processing technique and radiological image processing etc makes the CAD system more reliable and efficient. Sensitivity, specificity, absolute detection rate etc are the important parameters of the CAD system. Now CAD system is mostly used for breast cancer detection, lung cancer detection, colon cancer, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defect, lung cancer, bone cancer, brain tumor etc. Any part of body can affect cancer and very high possibility to spread other parts. These days CAD system developed to a great extends, however it's not reached to 100% accuracy. In this article that discusses the necessary options, motivation, findings from the early developments and future expansions of CAD systems.

AB  - Robotic grippers and its control is always a challenging and an interesting topic for the researcher. In the present scenario the most advanced gripping devices which are commercially available are of macro size. But the real challenge comes when we think for micro gripping or micro assembly. This paper represents a novel technique of gripping with Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) actuated finger and advance communication process with the help of joystick and data glove. This technique gives an advantage to control a micro gripping device from a remote location. End effectors are made of IPMC. IPMC is one of the Electro Active Polymer (EAPs) which holds an excellent bending property at low actuation voltage resulting in high force output, thus it is capable of doing work as good as human finger tip when the same is employed as an actuator for micromanipulation. This device can manipulate micro object less than 1 mm in diameter as well as macro sized object within 10 mm diameter. This finger design is compliant in nature. In this article the underlying principle based on which the gripper operates and its fabrication process are explained in detail. It involves miniature part handling, integration and assembly operation.

AB  - It is widely known that the email system forms a social network. Analysis of email networks reveals properties similar to classic social networks such as friendship or academic collaboration networks. Like other social networks, the properties observed in email networks are the result of patterns of human social behavior rather than the underlying technology. Hence, email social network properties correlate to the social environment in which they are generated. The overall social behavior observed in an organization may be attributed directly to organizational stability and robustness. As a result, organizational health and robustness may be discerned by examining the social network properties of the network formed by the email interaction of its employees because they certainly reflect changes in organizational mood. The fears, worries, gossips, the good and the bad, are reflected in the email activity of individuals in the organization; the challenge though is to extract his information from the network itself. In this paper we provide a first step in the process of demonstrating that email social network analysis can tell us more about the organization than we may think; we show using a case study based on the Enron corporation that problems in the organization were apparent as an emergent characteristic of social network formed by email exchange in the organization.

AB  - With the ever proliferating size and scale of the WWW [1], efficient ways of exploring content are of increasing importance. How can we efficiently retrieve information from it through crawling? And in this "era of tera" and multi-core processors, we ought to think of multi-threaded processes as a serving solution. So, even better how can we improve the crawling performance by using parallel crawlers that work independently? The paper devotes to the fundamental advantages and challenges arising from the design of parallel crawlers [4]. The paper mainly focuses on the aspect of URL distribution among the various parallel crawling processes. How to distribute URLs from the URL frontier to the various concurrently executing crawling process threads is an orthogonal problem. The paper provides a solution to the problem by designing a framework that partitions the URL frontier into a several URL queues by ordering the URLs within each of the distributed set of URLs.

AB  - Alzheimer's is progressive and irreversible type of dementia, which causes degeneration and death of cells and their connections in the brain. AD worsens over time and greatly impacts patients’ life and affects their important mental functions, including thinking, the ability to carry on a conversation, and judgment and response to environment. Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network. The proposed analysis pipeline has been tested and evaluated on benchmark ADNI dataset collected from 379 subjects patients. Quantitative validation of the obtained results documented our framework's capability, outperforming state-of-the-art learning approaches for both multi-and binary-class AD detection.

AB  - Noise is a challenge for process mining algorithms, but there is no standard definition of noise nor accepted way to quantify it. This means it is not possible to mine with confidence from event logs which may not record the underlying process correctly. We discuss one way of thinking about noise in process mining. We consider mining from a `noisy log' as learning a probability distribution over traces, representing the true process, from a log which is a sample from multiple distributions: the `true' process model and one or more `noise' models. We apply this using a probabilistic analysis of the Heuristics Miner algorithm, and demonstrate on a simple example. We show that for a given model it is possible to predict how much data is needed to mine the underlying model without the noise, and identify differences in the the robustness of Heuristics Miner to different types of noise.

AB  - Social media are increasingly popular, worldwide, and when social media technologies extend from the Western markets in which they were developed into the Eastern markets where they are now used, marketing strategies that support technology uses in new cultural contexts must be developed. To inform this process achieve this, social media researchers must learn new ways of thinking about technology in its cultural context. In a comparative study of the Southeast Asian social media markets of Vietnam and Singapore, we induce a grounded theory perspective of social media cultures, comparing across instances of both an emerging market and an advanced market in the hemispheric region. We find the Vietnamese culture of social media use orients around economic productivity, Social Commerce, leveraging social connections to generate consumer-to-consumer commerce largely outside of government notice and taxation. The Singaporean culture of social media revolves around the important and highly implicit notion of Influence Commerce. Singaporeans are experts in their application of social media presence to monetize the process of exerting social influence on networks of information and opinion. The Singaporean media use culture takes place with full knowledge and support of the relevant government Bureaus since most internally produced social media influence is political in nature and friendly to the ruling powers.

In this paper we describe a novel mechanism that successfully endows NPCs in real-time games with strategic planning capabilities. Our approach creates adaptive behaviours that take into account long-term and short term consequences. Our approach is unique in that: (i) it is sufficiently fast to be used for hundreds of agents in real time; (ii) it is flexible in that it requires no previous knowledge of the playing field; and (iii) it allows customization of the agents in order to generate differentiated behaviours that derive from virtual personalities.

AB  - Digital human in cyberspace can help provide humanized services in specific applications, such as question & answer systems, recommender systems, chatter robots, and intelligent assistants. While most researches focus on behavior analytics, few of them integrate the personality that is also a closely related factor. As a classic indicator for personality representation, Myers–Briggs type indicator (MBTI) categorizes an individual into mutually exclusive types from four dichotomous axes (extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, judging versus perceiving). Traditional recognition method using MBTI simply measures the user’s preference frequency in each axis through questionnaires, treating the dominant value as the identified result. Such a paradigm, however, represents all the people with only 16 types and cannot distinguish heterogeneous users clearly. This article proposes a novel personality recognition method using fuzzy logic. Different from previous classifications, our new method categorizes the individual in a continuous space and represents one’s personality in a more fine-grained level. We have designed comparative psychological tests for 77 people. The validation experiments on such tests indicate that the fuzzy-logic-based method is not only consistent with the classic MBTI tests (in the sense of defuzzification) but also provides the uncertainty for each personality type. Therefore, it can be viewed as a generalization of the classic MBTI tests and promotes the representation of individual’s heterogeneity for fine-grained analytics of digital human.

AB  - Recently, the epidemic of COVID-19 infection broke out in Wuhan, China. To explore the pathological mechanism of pneumonia infected by coronavirus, we built a bioinformatics pipeline based on time-series gene co-expression network analysis to analyze the gene expression profile of lung cells in mice infected by SARS-Cov (GSE19137). In this study, Pearson correlation analysis was performed to construct a gene co-expression network. Time-ordered gene network modules were digged out by BFS algorithm. PageRank algorithm was used to explore HUB genes related to pneumonia infected by coronavirus. Based on the information we got, we think that cell lines infected by coronavirus might go through 5 stages, and 10 HUB genes(AKT1, CD68, CTSS, FCGR3A, HSPA8, PTPRC, UBC, VCP, PRPF31, ITPKB) might play a key role in coronavirus infection. This might provide some hints for coronavirus related research.

AB  - Every moment, millions of people worldwide are communicating and sharing content online. We express ourselves online to enrich existing relationships and establish new relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop offline. Such actions are reflected in a corresponding set of digital social artifacts, such as blog posts, emails and status updates. We are accustomed to thinking of collections of digital artifacts online as repositories of information. What if we are now searching collections of digital social artifacts that reflect people's online relationships with one another and aspects of their lives? Are standard search methods sufficient? How do we want to query such data? We contend that general queries may have both informational and social components to them. We define social queries as queries about social attributes and behaviors that identify individuals, relationships or groups exhibiting such characteristics. To develop a deeper understanding of social query, we focus on the specific task of social relationship identification. In the context of two scenarios, we examine the challenges posed by the task, review an initial realization of social relationship identification and present a way forward to address the general task.

AB  - Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a hybrid AI technology that enables distributed human groups to "think together" in real-time systems modeled on natural swarms. Prior research has shown that by forming "human swarms," networked groups can substantially amplify their combined intelligence and produce significantly more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. The present study explores whether the rich behavioral data collected during "swarming" can be used to further increase the accuracy of swarm-based forecasts. To do this, a dense neural network was used to process the data collected during a set of swarm-based forecasts and generate a Conviction Index (CI) for each forecast that estimates its expected accuracy. This method was then tested in an authentic forecasting task – wagering on sporting events against the Vegas odds. Specifically, groups of sports fans, working as real-time swarms, were tasked with predicting the outcome of 238 NBA games over 25 consecutive weeks. As a baseline, the swarms achieved an impressive 25% net return on investment (ROI) against the Vegas Odds. This was compared to an enhanced method that used Conviction Index to (a) estimate the strength of each forecast and then (b) wager only on forecasts of sufficient strength. The CI-selected wagers yielded a 57% net ROI against Vegas Odds. This is a significant gain, equivalent to more than doubling the ROI of the naïve swarm betting strategy.

AB  - In artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition and reasoning are the most basic key elements for intelligent agent to obtain the ability of the simulation thinking which capacitate intelligent agent to carry out a series of actions. At present, Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been a primary technique for modelling knowledge acquisition and reasoning. This is mainly due to the dynamic epistemic logic has a stronger expression ability to deal with many problems about agent's cognitive reasoning in computer science. In this paper, we distinguish the major sorts of knowledge that the cognitive agent will hold in their interaction in the beginning, and then establish a Knowledge Acquisition System (KAS) which is added a new operator of `knowledge acquisition' to extend the basic epistemic language for bi-agent interaction. Other than that, we prove the soundness and completeness of this system, and analyze some properties about it. By this system, it is clear to explain how the agent acquires knowledge that will be transformed into common knowledge by observing the other agent's speech act. The acquired knowledge is further transformed into new private knowledge that provides the strategy options in agent's mind in interaction.

The following scenario is considered. Suppose that user Alice thinks that Bob might be a good new friend. So, Alice and the Online Social Network (representing Bob) engage in a two-party matching protocol. In this protocol no work from Bob is required, Bob can be offline. The matching protocol is designed to give Alice an indication if Bob is similar to her based on their profiles. We show that the process does so without revealing the private information of Alice and Bob to one another and to the Online Social Network.

AB  - Individual personality is a vital criterion in a human life as well as in a development of an organization. Every individual holds a different personality type with various characteristics in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Due to that matter, analyzing human personality should be done carefully which can be challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this study presents a personality prediction model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The prediction was realized on the Big Five personality model. The dataset consists of 709 rows and retrieved from open-source website called Kaggle. For training, validation and testing phases, the dataset was divided into 70:15:15 respectively. Findings of the study demonstrated the capability of ANN in producing better accuracy compared to three identified algorithms which includes Naïve Bayes, ZeroR and Random Forest.

AB  - The technological and online experiences of billions worldwide are dominated by a handful of companies known as “Big Tech.” Despite this being a cause for concern in governmental, economic, and ethical spheres, the literature lacks a study exploring the impact of public scandals on, and the global sentiment toward, Big Tech. Here, we quantify the power of Big Tech by analyzing their acquisitions, market capitalization, and number of monthly active users. Moreover, we utilize the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of public scandals on the stock price of two Big Tech companies, and find that they had no lasting effect. We also analyze the number of tweets mentioning these scandals, and find that they quickly fade from the spotlight. To explore public sentiment, we survey 5300 participants across 25 countries, and find that those from countries with lower digital literacy and more authoritarian regimes are more trusting of Big Tech. Furthermore, we find that one in three feels they lack control over the data collected about them, and one in four feels that Big Tech knows what they are thinking, knows more about them than their best friend, and may even be secretly listening to their conversations. Additionally, one in four feels addicted to Big Tech products, have no choice but to use them, and wishes there were more companies to choose from. These findings highlight the adverse effect of the oligopolistic nature of Big Tech on consumer choice and help inform policy-makers aiming to curb their dominance.

AB  - This paper presents a part of research into e-waste and e-cycling in Lebanon; it describes the status quo of today's governmental and NGO's actions, tools, and intentions about e-waste. The research questions answered throughout this paper are two: the first one wonders if the Lebanese society and government are aware of the e-waste hazards and whether there is any action taken, on the governmental level, to avert an environmental catastrophe. Whereas the second one is concerned with finding out, what Lebanese think about e-waste and whether they are willing to fight against it? Answers to the first question resulted from interviews. The authors have visited Company A and NGO B, the first is concerned with collecting waste in greater Beirut while the second aims at spreading awareness to e-waste's dangers on governmental and social levels alike. Question two was discussed throughout surveys filled by random individuals from Lebanese society. The answers to both research questions came in a way that proves both hypotheses assumed at the beginning of the research, namely that e-waste poses a great threat to the Lebanese environment and that laws must be implemented to regulate collection and disposal of electronic appliances; also, e-cycling initiatives must be encouraged to reduce the quantities of generated e-waste. Hypothesis two if environment friendliness and affinity to right e-waste disposal depend on the educational level of any given citizen has been proven to be true while analyzing the answers in the survey.

AB  - Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is the method through which test is done to measure the psychological condition of a person in viewing the world and making the decision. It is generally divided into 4 preference sets namely,' Extraversion - Introversion,' `Sensing - Intuition',' Thinking - Feeling',' Judgment - Perception'. This test is applied in many areas like, for recruitment of people into jobs, to choose career depending on one's personality, to estimate a person himself/herself, selecting optional subjects in universities. Here, the aim of the research work was to propose an optimized prediction analysis for allotting members to a project by the Project Manager by testing the members' ability through MBTI testing method and further analyzing and justifying that the person selected was most suitable for the project or required some advice for their improvement in the work. By using MBTI assessment the dataset for the proposed work has been created. For developing the experimental work, collection of answers for the predesigned questionnaire available in MBTI site from our college students were taken. Based on these data a novel method was developed to select a group of members who are fit to be in that project according to the requirements of the project manager. This is done through Homophily affect and thus study the behavior of each member within the group to test the rate of appropriate members selected by the project manager. Simulation was done by using R-studio and MATLAB thereby identifying the weak and strong bond among the members of the project.

AB  - In the very near future, the vast majority of mobile phones will be NFC-enabled. The NFC technology, other than adding extra features to mobile devices, adds a new way for attackers to break into these. To be sure that attackers will go after this technology, it is enough to think that the killer feature foreseen for this technology it will be the possibility for the user to pay on the fly with his phone, by simply putting the smartphone in close proximity to the payment device. The aim of this paper is to draw the attention to one aspect related to the security of NFC devices, the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF). In this paper will be introduced techniques for testing NDEF, as well as to propose a new solution for fuzz testing NDEF on smart phones.

AB  - The 2000s held many challenges for humanity. The 2008 mortgage crisis significantly redrawn our financial thinking and changed our attitudes towards financial products. The effects that thousands of people have suffered as a result of poorly made financial decisions have contributed to all these processes. The same characteristics could be said for businesses. Following the mortgage crisis, we became acquainted with a number of other financial crises during the 2000s, but a new level after all this was still the coronavirus epidemic escalated in 2020 and the ensuing crisis. The growing digitalisation challenge, the advancement of artificial intelligence, and the automation of processes are causing headaches for many small and medium-sized enterprises. Businesses around the world face these challenges, sometimes stronger and weaker. The aim of our study is to present the local, macroeconomic challenges and the assessment of those whose competitiveness is affected and influenced by the results of a questionnaire research conducted in Hungary. The research is part of an international survey, in our present study we want to present the effects in Hungary.

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has recently shown good performance in solving large-scale sensing tasks. As an essential topic in MCS, recommending tasks to participants has received extensive attention from researchers. Most studies assume that participants are absolutely rational, which is unrealistic because it is difficult for participants to know all the information about the transaction. Furthermore, most of them do not consider how to learn the preferences of new participants. In addition, their works are difficult to extend to different MCS scenarios. Considering the above problems, we propose an extensible bounded rationality-based task recommendation scheme (EBRTR), which contains a task recommendation framework and a bounded rationality decision-making model. First, a task recommendation framework that can be easily extended to various MCS scenarios is designed. Second, in our bounded rationality decision-making model, for participants with historical task information, according to the implicit information in their historical tasks, the human thinking mode with bounded rationality is simulated, and the improved classification and regression tree (ICART) algorithm is designed to construct the decision tree. For participants who newly join the platform, social information is introduced to construct an initial decision tree. Finally, extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB  - Recently strong AI emerged from artificial intelligence due to need for a thinking machine. In this domain, it is necessary to deal with dynamic incomplete data and understanding of how machines make their decision is also important, especially in information system domain. One type of learning called Covering Algorithms (CA) can be used instead of the difficult statistical machine learning methods to produce simple rule with powerful prediction ability. However, although using CA as the base of strong AI is a novel idea, doing so with the current methods available is not possible. Thus, this paper presents a novel CA (RULES-IT) and tests its performance over incomplete data. This algorithm is the first incremental algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules from different domains and introduce intelligent aspects using simple representation. The performance of RULES-IT will be tested over incomplete and complete data along with other algorithms in the literature. It will be validated using 5-fold cross validation in addition to Friedman with Nemenyi post hoc tests to measure the significance and rank the algorithms.

AB  - Main functions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the human BDNF gene (Val66Met) impairs activity-dependent secretion of the BDNF, and carrying Met allele is associated with poorer learning. We explored the role of BDNF polymorphism in short-term plasticity induced by complex cognitive stimulation with creativity thinking tasks in Caucasian adults from younger (22.7±3.7 years old, N = 63) and older (63.5±5.2 years old, N = 49) age groups. Resting-state EEG with eyes open was recorded prior to and immediately after forty-minute verbal and figural creative task performance. The EEG spectral density in individual alpha frequency band was calculated using FFT in pre-task and post-task intervals. All subjects were genotyped for BDNF status. ANOVA revealed more left-sided (left>right) changes from pre-task to post-task intervals in Val/Val homozygotes in comparison with Met carriers. BDNF-associated alpha power asymmetry indicator in frontal region, which is well-known manifestation of motivational withdrawal/approach, was strongly correlated with interest in tasks (not with originality, amount of ideas, or task difficulty). Mediation analysis confirmed that attenuated frontal asymmetry (left-right) of pre/post task changes in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val was associated with lower interest in tasks - component of internal motivation for creative problem solving. These findings suggest that complex cognitive stimulation with creativity tasks induced tendency towards withdrawal motivation in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val at the level of brain activity.

AB  - Disease diagnosis in smart settings has been transformed by the fast development of technology, especially the Internet of Things (IoT) and Swarm Intelligence. Various health-related data may be continually monitored and collected in smart environments due to the abundance of sensors. However, this data's vast quantity and complexity complicates accurate illness diagnosis and early management. Inspired by the coordinated actions of flocks of birds and swarms of insects, Swarm Intelligence provides a novel paradigm for analyzing and understanding this mountain of data. Hence, this paper proposes a Swarm Intelligence-enabled Disease Diagnosis (SI-DD) in smart environments using IoT-based sensors. Smart systems use algorithms motivated by swarm behaviour to assess data from several sensors in concert, allowing for faster, more accurate illness diagnosis. As a shape of collective swarm intelligence, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) enables make healthcare treatments more effective. As a result, sufferers get care tailor-made to their unique desires, thinking about their scientific history and the kingdom of the healthcare machine. This article examines the most distinguished makes use of the Internet of Things and Swarm Intelligence in healthcare. It highlights how those techniques have already shown their promise for higher contamination detection. With this in thoughts, it's clear that the usage of clever sensors prepared with Swarm Intelligence for infection detection in clever settings is a viable path toward enhancing healthcare results and the first-rate of existence for sufferers. This novel approach has the capability to revolutionize contamination surveillance, prognosis, and control, leading to greater cost-effective scientific services and higher results for sufferers.

AB  - Organized misinformation campaigns on Twitter continue to proliferate, even as the platform acknowledges such activities through its transparency center. These deceptive initiatives significantly impact vital societal issues, including climate change, thus spurring research aimed at pinpointing and intercepting these malicious actors. Present-day algorithms for detecting bots harness an array of data drawn from user profiles, tweets, and network configurations, delivering commendable outcomes. Yet, these strategies mainly concentrate on postincident identification of malevolent users, hinging on static training datasets that categorize individuals based on historical activities. Diverging from this approach, we advocate for a forward-thinking methodology, which utilizes user data to foresee and mitigate potential threats before their realization, thereby cultivating more secure, equitable, and unbiased online communities. To this end, our proposed technique forecasts malevolent activities by tracing the projected trajectories of user embeddings before any malevolent action materializes. For validation, we employed a dynamic directed multigraph paradigm to chronicle the evolving engagements between Twitter users. When juxtaposed against the identical dataset, our technique eclipses contemporary methodologies by an impressive 40.66% in F score (F1 score) in the anticipatory identification of harmful users. Furthermore, we undertook a model evaluation exercise to gauge the efficiency of distinct system elements.

AB  - A lot of data are collected through various kind of sensors and devices and can be used to make business strategy. These are sometimes used in business and marketing. In existing convention management research and its business research, most of contributions provide the result of analyses of surveys using answer of questionnaire or interviews from convention attendees, event planners and several other stakeholders. If we can know attendees' behavior, perception, and thinking by collecting data from sensors, digital voice recorders and cameras, the management and business design can be designed based on the analysis in order to improve the quality of service and attendee's satisfaction. In this paper, we explain what convention attendees expect to attend the conventions. We show our preliminary experiments to collect attendees' behavior data in a convention. Then, we propose an improved design on experiment environment to acquire attendees' data in convention. We propose a refined model of convention management research and business process in the end of this paper. In our proposed research and business process on convention management, a lot of types acquired data from sensors set in convention facility and can promise to design an improved service to enhance attendees' satisfaction in convention.

AB  - Many successful methods for image classification transform low-level descriptors into mid-level features, and obtain a compact and discriminative representation. However, these approaches rarely think about the spatial context information between mid-level features. In this paper, we present a new mixed-order structural (MOS) representation which may generalize the widely used method spatial pyramid representation (SPR) with correlation modeling method. We first partition the image following SP and extract the mid-level feature for each spatial region. Then our MOS consists of 0th and 1st - order correlation model based on mid-level features. The 0th- order correlation can answer what the mid-level feature represents, and the 1-th order corresponds to spatial contextual information in ambient neighbors. In addition, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of mid-level features which makes our MOS can be a relatively low dimensionality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MOS representation achieves a better performance compared with spatial pyramid matching (SPM) and other state-of-the-art algorithms.

With a brief description of the book, we prepare the formulation of the new tasks of the comparison. In doing so, the revolutionary change that took place in the infosphere of humanity with the co-evolution of computing, networking and representing information, and which is still in intensive development, must be taken into account. The book contrasts the stored program architecture based on Neumann’s principle with the neural network architecture of the brain. The numerical comparison is based on differences in the performance, number, and density of the active elements. The comparison cannot be continued in this way, because we are not dealing with individual computers, but with a system of cooperating machines organized in the Internet. The worlds of the two kinds of machines jointly use the latest collection of artificially created information carriers, the Data Sphere, and together they form the active information processing component of the Humanity’s infosphere. The carriers of information provide the common, materially existing object of computation and thinking, which I call formation in the paper. The information event, introduced in the paper, associate formation with information. Formation means information when the observation or creation of the formation in an information event is connected to the meaning for its owner. While the information processing of computers is only the transformation of formations, the assignment of meaning is carried on in an information event both before and after the transformation. In the most important information event, the owner is the human mind. The separating barrier between the two worlds is the information event. Within the computer systems, there are no more information events, only formations are transformed, in which the activation of program formations enables the automatic execution of the computation.

AB  - When analyzing the Radio Frequency Identification applications, one might think of two essential hierarchies: the structures aiming to offer security to an RFID system and the structures aiming to offer functionality means, with no security issues. One should know precisely the significance of these notions. Radio Frequency Identification represents an advanced wireless technology, which integrates an essential solution within the fields of intelligent chips and automation technologies. In this paper, four protocols based on updating the tags' identifiers by means of RFID readers will be compared, in order to carry out an analysis over the jeopardizing points that threaten the security and privacy of RFID systems. Cryptography signifies a way of creating RFID systems more secure. A chaotic matter is brought into discussion, by the following situations: to find out if it is a protocol of identification or authentication that is necessary, depending on various RFID applications or systems. Such analysis over RFID security has carried out wide thoughts.

AB  - The paper aims to present the real current situation of the state of education being provided by various schools in rural areas of the central Indian district of Yavatmal in the state of Maharashtra situated in India. Also, the paper is an attempt to analyze the data using simple analytical tools from an artificial intelligence perspective to predict various parameters indicating the future shape and direction of education is going to in these rural parts of mainland India. The study is based on real survey data collected by visiting numerous schools after receiving written permission from the Block Development Officer of Tehsil Yavatmal. The initial emphasis was on girl education but has been generalized to boys as well because of the coeducation system. The process involved talks on the state of the art of education and collection of data from respective heads of the school followed by interviews with schoolteachers, nonteaching staff, and students. The study is represented in the form of graphs, inferences, and observations on the complicated way ahead, for education to reach these deprived large chunks of people, who think that their future is their children and education is the only key responsible for new light to come to their lives. The paper includes the developmental stages Indian education passed through from pre-independence to recent times.
