AB  - Theoretical and practical issues in geomorphology have not been adequately addressed due to a lack of formalization and digital representation of spatial and temporal concepts, given the limitations associated with modern-day geographic information systems (GIS). Rapid advancements in geospatial technologies have resulted in new sensors and large volumes of geospatial data that have yet to be fully exploited given a variety of computational issues. Computational limitations involving storage, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling pose significant problems for Earth scientists. Consequently, advanced cyberinfrastructure is required to address geospatial data-science issues involving communication, representation, computation, information production, decision-making, and geovisualization. We identify and discuss important aspects of exploiting advances in cyberinfrastructure that involve computational scalability, artificial intelligence, and uncertainty characterization and analysis for addressing issues in the Earth sciences. Such developments can be termed cyber geographic information science and systems (cyberGIS). We discuss this important topic by addressing the significant overlap of concepts in GIS and geomorphology that can be formalized, digitally represented, implemented, and evaluated with cyberGIS. We then introduce the fundamentals of cyberinfrastructure and cyberGIS, including a discussion of the utilization of artificial intelligence and deep learning. We finally provide one case study demonstrating operational cyberGIS capabilities.

AB  - This paper aims at indicating the convergence points between what is habitually understood as a pair of opposing terms: mind (as in thinking) and body (as in sensation). Structural models in psychotherapy conceptualize human mind in terms of levels of information processing (both internal and external information). We suggest that a mental split between mind and body leads to a feeling of estrangement from self, as well as an estrangement from external world. Drawing on relational approaches on psychotherapy, we suggest that focusing on perceiving own sensations does not necessarily imply a state of personal isolation from outside world; rather, this simultaneously means the perceiving and acceptance of “otherness”.

AB  - The recognition task of visual stimuli based on EEG (Electroencephalogram) has become a major and important topic in the field of Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) research. Although the underlying spatial features of EEG can effectively represent visual stimulus information, it still remains a highly challenging task to explore the local–global information of the underlying EEG to achieve better decoding performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose a deep learning architecture called Linear-Attention-combined Convolutional Neural Network (LACNN) for visual stimuli EEG-based classification task. The proposed architecture combines the modules of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Linear Attention, effectively extracting local and global features of EEG for decoding while maintaining low computational complexity and model parameters. We conducted extensive experiments on a public EEG dataset from the Stanford Digital Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that LACNN achieves an average decoding accuracy of 54.13% and 29.83% in 6-category and 72-exemplar classification tasks respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods, which indicates that our method can effectively decode visual stimuli from EEG. Further analysis of LACNN shows that the Linear Attention module improves the separability between different category features and localizes key brain region information that aligns with the paradigm principles.

AB  - Current intervention research in special education focuses on children's responsiveness to teacher modeled strategies and not conceptual development within children's thinking. As a result, there is a need for research that provides a characterization of key understandings (KUs) of fractional quantity evidenced by children with learning disabilities (LD) and how growth of conceptual knowledge may occur within these children's mathematical activity. This case study extends current literature by presenting KUs of fractional quantity, evidenced through problem solving strategies, observable operations, and naming/quantification of one fifth grader with LD before, during, and after seven instructional sessions situated in equal sharing. The researchers utilized a characterization of evolving fraction conceptions developed from research of children without disabilities that was ultimately productive in facilitating conceptual advances of the child with LD. We hypothesize that the trajectory of the child's conceptions is a case of something more general. Pending future research, the trajectory may be a useful tool to practitioners wishing to plan thoughtful, conceptually-based fraction instruction that is responsive to all children's evolving conceptions of fractions as quantities built through their own mathematical activity.

AB  - Hyperparameter optimization of spiking neural networks (SNNs) is a difficult task which has not yet been deeply investigated in the literature. In this work, we designed a scalable constrained Bayesian based optimization algorithm that prevents sampling in non-spiking areas of an efficient high dimensional search space. These search spaces contain infeasible solutions that output no or only a few spikes during the training or testing phases, we call such a mode a “silent network”. Finding them is difficult, as many hyperparameters are highly correlated to the architecture and to the dataset. We leverage silent networks by designing a spike-based early stopping criterion to accelerate the optimization process of SNNs trained by spike timing dependent plasticity and surrogate gradient. We parallelized the optimization algorithm asynchronously, and ran large-scale experiments on heterogeneous multi-GPU Petascale architecture. Results show that by considering silent networks, we can design more flexible high-dimensional search spaces while maintaining a good efficacy. The optimization algorithm was able to focus on networks with high performances by preventing costly and worthless computation of silent networks.

AB  - Knowledge diffusion is a significant driving force behind discipline development and technological innovation. Keyword is a unique knowledge diffusion trajectory, in which the sleeping beauty phenomenon sometimes appears. In this paper, we first put forward the concept of Keyword Sleeping Beauties (KSBs) on the basis of the scientific literature phenomenon of sleeping beauties. Then, we construct a parameter-free identification method to distinguish KSBs based on beauty coefficient criteria. Furthermore, we analyze the intrinsic and extrinsic influencing factors to explore the awakening mechanism of KSBs. The experiment results show that sleeping beauty phenomena also exist in the keyword diffusion trajectory and 284 KSBs are identified. The depth of sleep has a positive correlation with awakening intensity, while the length of sleep has a negative correlation with awakening intensity. In the two years of pre-awakening, KSBs tend to appear in the journals with a higher impact factor. In addition, the adoption frequency and the number of KSBs both increase obviously in the one year of pre-awakening. The findings of this paper enrich the patterns of knowledge diffusion and extend academic thinking on the sleeping beauty in science.

AB  - Offshore wind power planning in China thus far has generally inherited the principles and thinking of onshore wind power planning. Mid- to offshore wind power access could incur a cost far higher than that of onshore wind generation, accounting for 15%–30% of the total investment. Sea state resources, corridor resources, landing conditions, and submarine cable wiring all face materially contrasting constraints to onshore wind power, necessitating dedicated planning efforts for offshore wind power. In this chapter, a planning framework for the sequential and cascaded development of mid- to offshore wind power bases is proposed, and a tiered master planning approach featuring on-site, cluster, and AC/DC transmission is established, filling the gap in transmission planning of large-scale mid- to offshore wind farm clusters. Firstly, location optimization of offshore hub substations based on a steepest descent method is established and explaining its specific implementation methods. Secondly, an improved minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to find a topology connection method for the collector system with the optimal length of submarine cable, which makes the cost optimal. Finally, the optimization model of transmission equipment selection considering the risk of high wind speed truncation is established, and the topology optimization modeling method of offshore wind power cluster transmission systems based on the improved ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed.

AB  - After the integrative storage of associated signals, a signal induces the recollection of its associated signal, or the other way around. This associative memory is essential to associative thinking, logical reasoning, imagination and computation. In terms of cellular mechanisms underlying associative memory, new mutual synapse innervations are formed among those coactivated neurons, so that they are recruited to be associative memory cells or associative memory neurons. These associative memory cells receive new synapse innervations alongside innate synapse inputs and encode signals carried by these inputs. We proposed to examine microRNAs as initiative factors for recruiting new synapse innervations and associative memory cells. In a mouse model of associative memory characterized as the reciprocal retrieval of associated whisker and odor signals, barrel and piriform cortical neurons gain their ability to encode whisker and odorant signals based on the newly formed synapse innervations between these coactivated cortices besides innate synapse inputs. miRNA-324 and miRNA-133a are required for recruiting these new synapse innervations and associative memory cells as well as sufficient for facilitating their recruitments, but not for innate synapse inputs. Therefore, the coactivation of sensory cortices through microRNA as initiative factor to recruit new mutual synapse innervations and associative memory cells for associative memory.

KW  - DNA mixtures

AB  - The maximum allele count (MAC) across loci and the total allele count (TAC) are often used to gauge the number of contributors to a DNA mixture. Computational strategies that predict the total number of alleles in a mixture arising from a certain number of contributors of a given population have been developed. Previous work considered the restricted case where all of the contributors to a mixture are unrelated. We relax this assumption and allow mixture contributors to be related according to a pedigree. We introduce an efficient computational strategy. This strategy based on first determining a probability distribution on the number of independent alleles per locus, and then conditioning on this distribution to compute a distribution of the number of distinct alleles per locus. The distribution of the number of independent alleles per locus is obtained by leveraging the Identical by Descent (IBD) pattern distribution which can be computed from the pedigree. We explain how allelic dropout and a subpopulation correction can be accounted for in the calculations.

AB  - Most of the existing anomaly detection methods are based on a single and fine granularity input pattern, which is susceptible to noisy data and inefficient for detecting anomalies. Granular-ball computing, as a novel multi-granularity representation and computation method, can effectively compensate for these shortcomings. We utilize the fuzzy rough sets to mine the potential uncertainty information in the data efficiently. The combination of granular-ball computing and fuzzy rough sets takes into account the benefits of both methods, providing great application and research value. However, this novel combination still needs to be explored, especially for unsupervised anomaly detection. In this study, we first propose the granular-ball fuzzy rough set model, and the relevant definitions in the model are given. Subsequently, we pioneeringly present an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on granular-ball fuzzy rough sets called granular-ball fuzzy rough sets-based anomaly detection (GBFRD). Our method introduces the granular-ball fuzzy rough granules-based outlier factor to characterize the outlier degree of an object effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that GBFRD exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Mxeron/GBFRD.

AB  - The strong interconnection between human activities, energy use and pollution reduction strategies in contemporary society has determined the necessity of collecting scientific knowledge from different fields to provide useful methods and models to foster the transition towards more sustainable energy systems. This is a challenging task in particular for contemporary communities where an increasing demand for services is combined with rapidly changing lifestyles and habits. The Smart Grid concept is the result of a confluence of issues and a convergence of objectives, which include national energy security, climate change, pollution reduction, grid reliability, etc. While thinking about a paradigm shift in energy systems, drivers, characteristics, market segments, applications and other interconnected aspects must be taken into account simultaneously. In this context, the use of multi-commodity network flow models for dynamic energy management aims at finding a compromise between model usefulness, accuracy, flexibility, solvability and scalability in Smart Grid applications.

AB  - The ability to effectively apply resilience-oriented thinking into practice starts with understanding, measuring, and evaluating the benefits and costs of resilience. With this knowledge it also becomes possible to comparatively assess potential planning, design, and maintenance options to plan and allocate financial and personnel resources most effectively to address needs. Other key components of practical and meaningful measurements and assessments of resilience are establishing metrics that quantify its performance and knowing what and how much data to collect. Then, understanding what these data mean so that goals, objectives, and expectations of resilience can be set, both within transportation organizations and for the consumers of the services they provide. Unfortunately, there is no universal agreement on what resilience even is, let alone how to systematically measure and assess it. However, recent reviews of practice and research show that ideas and methods to evaluate and assess resilience are evolving at a rapid pace, both within and outside of transportation. This chapter presents a summary of these ideas and compares and contrasts the effort they require to implement and the benefits they are expected to bring.

AB  - NeurOS is an open platform for accelerating research, development and hosting execution of intelligent applications. A NeurOS application is a directed “neural graph” of modular components connected by signal paths, similar to biological brain connectivity and functional block diagrams of neural pathways. Built-in reusable modules (NeuroBlocks) provide a wide range of general- and special-purpose capabilities: inputs/senses, outputs/effectors, processing, memory, pattern learning and recognition, visualization/instrumentation, custom module development, integrating external intelligence capabilities, and sub-graph reuse. NeurOS sub-graph assemblies address neural/cognitive functions including perception, pattern learning and recognition, working memory, imagination, prediction, context priming, attention, abstraction, classification, associational thinking and behavior. NeurOS applications are inherently portable, scalable, networkable, extensible and embeddable. NeurOS development tools provide simple intuitive graphical drag and drop application assembly from components without programming, along with testing, debugging, monitoring and visualization. Prototype NeurOS applications have begun to explore a wide range of intelligent functions in diverse areas, including aspects of pattern recognition, vision, music, reading, puzzle solving, reasoning, behavior. Building working intelligent systems using NeurOS and NeuroBlocks lets researchers and developers focus on their core functions and rapidly iterate and instrument working models, fostering both analytical and biological insight as well as usable systems.

AB  - The ubiquitous sameness of urban greenways prompts questions on generative design grammar and syntax, whether creative, critical rethinking at that level might be lacking. However the design syntax of urban greenways is not explicitly discussed thus leaving a critical gap in knowledge. This paper begins tackling the larger question by acting on the fundamental subset of it, by operationalizing the design syntax of urban greenways. This is done through mathematics-based graph studies to analyze patterns and shapes, photography based thermal, material and morphology studies, and section analyses to make imagery-derived deductions on the design syntax. Recommendation on approaches to diversify and enrich the design syntax includes a more direct reference from ecosystem science theories such for siting and planning the urban greenways at macro- to meso-scale, a mixed-method approach, combining mathematics, photography and drawings based frames for analyses at meso-, to micro-scale, and a turtle view scale for designing at meso- to micro-scale, with an emphasis on latter.

AB  - Growing neurophysiological evidence points to a role of alpha oscillations in divergent thinking (DT). In particular, studies have shown a consistent EEG alpha synchronization during performance on the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), a well-established DT task. However, there is a need for investigating the brain dynamics underlying the production of a sequence of multiple, alternative ideas at the AUT and their relationship with idea originality. In twenty young adults, we investigated changes in alpha power during performance on a structured version of the AUT, requiring to ideate four alternative uses for conventional objects in distinct and sequentially balanced time periods. Data analysis followed a three-step approach, including behaviour aspects, physiology aspects, and their mutual relationship. At the behavioural level, we observed a typical serial order effect during DT production, with an increase of originality associated with an increase in ideational time and a decrease in response percentage over the four responses. This pattern was paralleled by a shift from alpha desynchronization to alpha synchronization across production of the four alternative ideas. Remarkably, alpha power changes were able to explain response originality, with a differential role of alpha power over different sensor sites. In particular, alpha synchronization over frontal, central, and temporal sites was able to predict the generation of original ideas in the first phases of the DT process, whereas alpha synchronization over centro-parietal sites persistently predicted response originality during the entire DT production. Moreover, a bilateral hemispheric effect in frontal sites and a left-lateralized effect in central, temporal, and parietal sensor sites emerged as predictors of the increase in response originality. These findings highlight the temporal dynamics of DT production across the generation of alternative ideas and support a partially distinct functional role of specific cortical areas during DT.

AB  - The method of harmonic balance (HB) is a spectrally accurate method used to obtain periodic steady state solutions to dynamical systems subjected to periodic perturbations. We adapt HB to solve for the stress response of the Giesekus model under large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) deformation. HB transforms the system of differential equations to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations in the Fourier coefficients. Convergence studies find that the difference between the HB and true solutions decays exponentially with the number of harmonics (H) included in the ansatz as e−mH. The decay coefficient m decreases with increasing strain amplitude, and exhibits a “U” shaped dependence on applied frequency. The computational cost of HB increases slightly faster than linearly with H. The net result of rapid convergence and modest increase in computational cost with increasing H implies that HB outperforms the conventional method of using numerical integration to solve differential constitutive equations under oscillatory shear. Numerical experiments find that HB is simultaneously about three orders of magnitude cheaper, and several orders of magnitude more accurate than numerical integration. Thus, it offers a compelling value proposition for parameter estimation or model selection.

AB  - This paper presents a 10-year review study that focuses on the investigation of the use of Digital Card Games (DCGs) as learning tools in education. Specific search terms keyed into 10 large scientific electronic databases identified 50 papers referring to the use of non-commercial DCGs in education during the last decade (2003–2013). The findings revealed that the DCGs reported in the reviewed papers: (a) were used for the learning of diverse subject disciplines across all educational levels and leaning towards the school curriculum, in two ways: game-construction and game-play, (b) were mainly proposed by their designers as meaningful, familiar and appealing learning contexts, in order to motivate and engage players/students and also to promote social, rich and constructivist educational experiences while at the same time integrating modern technologies and innovative gamed-based approaches, (c) were implemented using a plethora of digital tools, (d) mainly adopted social and constructivist views of learning during their design and use, although the views were explicitly reported in only a few of these, (e) were evaluated – in more than half of the studies – with positive results in terms of: student learning, attitudes towards DCGs and enrichment of social interaction and collaboration, (f) appeared to support students to acquire essential thinking skills through DCG-play. However, despite the rich DCG-game experiences reported in the reviewed papers, some essential but under-researched topics were also specified.

AB  - This paper presents a method called Interval Incremental Learning (IIL) to capture spatial and temporal patterns in uncertain data streams. The patterns are represented by information granules and a granular rule base with the purpose of developing explainable human-centered computational models of virtual and physical systems. Fundamentally, interval data are either included into wider and more meaningful information granules recursively, or used for structural adaptation of the rule base. An Uncertainty-Weighted Recursive-Least-Squares (UW-RLS) method is proposed to update affine local functions associated with the rules. Online recursive procedures that build interval-based models from scratch and guarantee balanced information granularity are described. The procedures assure stable and understandable rule-based modeling. In general, the model can play the role of a predictor, a controller, or a classifier, with online sample-per-sample structural adaptation and parameter estimation done concurrently. The IIL method is aligned with issues and needs of the Internet of Things, Big Data processing, and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. An application example concerning real-time land-vehicle localization and tracking in an uncertain environment illustrates the usefulness of the method. We also provide the Driving Through Manhattan interval dataset to foster future investigation.

AB  - Educational institutions can incorporate the idea of sustainability at the grass root level for any society. This study is part of an effort to get insight into the campus sustainability in one of the Higher Education Institution (HEI) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan. Aim is to investigation university students' and faculty members insight regarding sustainability. Thus, questionnaire-based survey followed by statistical inference was conducted for the potential outcomes. The questionnaire is comprised of 24 questions, 05 of which are on demographics and the remaining 19 are about sustainability. The sustainability related questions focused mostly on the respondents' knowledge, understanding, and interest in sustainability. A handful of the other questions in the questionnaire were tailored to the university input to achieve sustainability. The dataset is manipulated with basic statistical and computational approaches, and the results are analyzed using mean values. The mean values are further classified into flag values of 0 and 1. Flag value 1 indicates a good marker of the received response, while flag value 0 indicates the least amount of information included in responses. The results show that respondents' knowledge, awareness, interest, and engagement in sustainability are significantly sufficient, as we obtained a flag value of 1 for all questions about sustainability. The study's findings, on the other hand, indicated that the institution is lagging in terms of supporting, disseminating, and implementing campus-wide sustainability-related activities. This study is one of the first initiatives to provide a baseline dataset and substantial information to go a step further in achieving the bottom-line target of being and acting sustainable in the HEI.

Tasks and structure of such an intelligent information support system (IISS), IISS design stages, methodology of IISS design, toolkits for IISS design are considered. A flexible simulation complex (FSC) as such an intelligent toolkit has been presented. The complex is used as a “kernel” of IISS for human-operators of a nuclear power plant. A new approach to abnormal situations with regard for the heuristic regularities of human-operator thinking process is proposed. The regularities are revealed on basis of recording the motions of the human- operator eyes over the information field of the control board and processing the experimental data obtained. For data processing, a probability theoretical approach is used based on involving the notion of consistency of measures of dependence of random variables.

AB  - The field of durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has undergone an incredible evolution over the past few decades, resulting in significant improvements in longevity and quality of life for patients with advanced heart failure. Despite these successes, substantial opportunities for further improvements remain, including in pump design and ancillary technology, perioperative and postoperative management, and the overall patient experience. Ideally, durable MCS devices would be fully implantable, automatically controlled, and minimize the need for anticoagulation. Reliable and long-term total artificial hearts for biventricular support would be available; and surgical, perioperative, and postoperative management would be informed by the individual patient phenotype along with computational simulations. In this review, we summarize emerging technological innovations in these areas, focusing primarily on innovations in late preclinical or early clinical phases of study. We highlight important considerations that the MCS community of clinicians, engineers, industry partners, and venture capital investors should consider to sustain the evolution of the field.

AB  - Mathematics shares with language an essential reliance on the human capacity for recursion, permitting the generation of an infinite range of embedded expressions from a finite set of symbols. We studied the role of syntax in arithmetic thinking, a neglected component of numerical cognition, by examining eye movement sequences during the calculation of arithmetic expressions. Specifically, we investigated whether, similar to language, an expression has to be scanned sequentially while the nested syntactic structure is being computed or, alternatively, whether this structure can be extracted quickly and in parallel. Our data provide evidence for the latter: fixations sequences were stereotypically organized in clusters that reflected a fast identification of syntactic embeddings. A syntactically relevant pattern of eye movement was observed even when syntax was defined by implicit procedural rules (precedence of multiplication over addition) rather than explicit parentheses. While the total number of fixations was determined by syntax, the duration of each fixation varied with the complexity of the arithmetic operation at each step. These findings provide strong evidence for a syntactic organization for arithmetic thinking, paving the way for further comparative analysis of differences and coincidences in the instantiation of recursion in language and mathematics.

Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.

AB  - Resilience has been intensely investigated as the viable quality of individuals, groups, organizations, and systems to respond productively to notable change without engaging in an extended period of regressive behaviour. Recently, there has been growing attention to the relationship between resilience and cities. To contribute to this stimulating debate, this paper first provides the theoretical framework and links the concept of resilience to urban studies. Subsequently, it enlightens, through a systems perspective and the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) methodology, the possibility to enrich the information variety endowment of urban policymakers, generated by new information units, to foster resilience capabilities in the urban context. Specifically, a large-scale text analysis study was conducted on the city of Rome to understand the sentiments expressed within the text generated online by citizens and visitors. The positive or negative sentiments linked to the hidden problems of the urban context were organized within collective perception-based maps for each of the analysed points of interest (POIs). Since cities represent complex decision-making contexts, this study aimed to outline a methodology and a tool that would help foster resilient thinking in urban policies by enriching the diversity of the information variety endowment of urban decision-makers.

AB  - Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is usually deployed in energy and delay constrained networks, such as internet of things networks and transportation systems to address the issues of energy consumption, computation capacity and network delay. In this work, we focus on a special case, which is Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Edge Computing (UEC) network. Addressing the security issues in UAV-Edge Computing network is mandatory due to the criticality of UEC services, such as network traffic monitoring, or search and rescue operations. However, cyber defense and protection of UEC network have not yet received sufficient research attention. Thereby, we propose and develop a cyber-defense solution based on a non-cooperative game to protect the UEC from network and offloading attacks, while taking into account nodes’ energy constraints and computation overhead. Simulation results show that, the deployment of our cyber defense system in UEC network requires low energy consumption and low computation overhead to obtain a high protection rate.

AB  - The mechanical structure topology design based on substructure always adopts the traditional substructure design method, which often comes from the experience and is limited by the inherent or stereotyped design thinking. A substructure design method based on biological unit cell (UC) is proposed, which draws inspiration from the biological efficient load-bearing topology structure. Especially, the thought of the formalized problem-solving of extension matter-element is introduced. Through the matter-element definition of UC substructure, the process model for the structure bionic topology design method based on biological UC is formed, which avoids the random or wild mental stimulation of the structure topology design method based on traditional substructure. In particular, in this proposed method, aiming at the problem about how to achieve the integration of high-efficiency load-bearing advantage of different organisms, furthermore, a biological UC hybridization method based on the principle of inventive problem solving theory (TRIZ) is proposed. The typical case is used to illustrate the process of this method in detail. The results from simulations and experiments both show that: the load-bearing capacity of structure design based on biology UC is improved than the initial design; on this basis, the load-bearing capacity of structure design is improved further through UC hybridization. All these show the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method.

Exploratory experiment, in contrast, arguably demands a broader conception of computing. Empirical Modelling (EM) is proposed as a more appropriate conceptual framework in which to provide computational support for exploratory experiment. In the process, it promises to provide integrated computational support for both exploratory and post-theory experiment. We first sketch the motivation for EM and illustrate its potential for supporting experimentation, then briefly highlight the semantic challenge it poses and the philosophical implications.

AB  - The way one asks a question is shaped by a-priori assumptions and constrains the range of possible answers. We identify and test the assumptions underlying contemporary debates, models, and methodology in the study of the neural correlates of consciousness, which was framed by Crick and Koch’s seminal paper (1990). These premises create a sequential and passive conception of conscious perception: it is considered the product of resolved information processing by unconscious mechanisms, produced by a singular event in time and place representing the moment of entry. The conscious percept produced is then automatically retained to be utilized by post-conscious mechanisms. Major debates in the field, such as concern the moment of entry, the all-or-none vs graded nature, and report vs no-report paradigms, are driven by the consensus on these assumptions. We show how removing these assumptions can resolve some of the debates and challenges and prompt additional questions. The potential non-sequential nature of perception suggests new ways of thinking about consciousness as a dynamic and dispersed process, and in turn about the relationship between conscious and unconscious perception. Moreover, it allows us to present a parsimonious account for conscious perception while addressing more aspects of the phenomenon.

AB  - The underconnectivity theory of autism attributes the disorder to lower anatomical and functional systems connectivity between frontal and more posterior cortical processing. Here we review evidence for the theory and present a computational model of an executive functioning task (Tower of London) implementing the assumptions of underconnectivity. We make two modifications to a previous computational account of performance and brain activity in typical individuals in the Tower of London task (Newman et al., 2003): (1) the communication bandwidth between frontal and parietal areas was decreased and (2) the posterior centers were endowed with more executive capability (i.e., more autonomy, an adaptation is proposed to arise in response to the lowered frontal-posterior bandwidth). The autism model succeeds in matching the lower frontal-posterior functional connectivity (lower synchronization of activation) seen in fMRI data, as well as providing insight into behavioral response time results. The theory provides a unified account of how a neural dysfunction can produce a neural systems disorder and a psychological disorder with the widespread and diverse symptoms of autism.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is systems aim to facilitate human monitoring and the direction of efficient production of goods in industrial settings by linking a wide variety of intelligent devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers. This is achieved by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) to diagnose a problem with a specific IIoT part is to employ a basic diagnostic technique that's based on models and data. Physical models, signal patterns, and machine-learning strategies must be adequately built to account for system challenges. Another factor that could lead to an exponential rise in complexity is the ever-increasing interconnections between different electronic hardware. The knowledge-based defect diagnosis methods boost interoperability in the operation. Users don't need to be experts in the field to benefit from the system's high-level thinking and response to their queries. So, in advanced IIoT systems, a knowledge-based fault diagnostic approach is favored over traditional model-based and data-driven diagnosis methods. The goal of this study is to evaluate recent improvements in the design of knowledge-based defect detection in the context of IIoT systems, deductive and inductive reasoning, and many other forms of logical reasoning. IIoT-based systems have revolutionized industrial settings by connecting intelligent devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers to enable efficient production and human monitoring. In this survey paper, we explore machine learning-based sensor fusion techniques within the realm of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), addressing critical challenges in fault detection and diagnosis.

AB  - To enhance the hydraulic energy utilization and torque output stability, a novel mechatronics-electro-hydraulic power coupling electric vehicle (MEH-PCEV) is proposed, integrating a hydraulic pump/motor and a motor into a single device for mutual energy conversion. For MEH-PCEVs equipped with multiple energy sources, a cluster analysis method is used to classify the actual road test dataset and provide guiding ideas for designing rule-based energy management strategies (RB-EMS). Simultaneously, for the output torque anomaly phenomenon in RB-EMS, an inverse thinking fuzzy logic optimization energy management strategy (FLO-EMS) conside ring multi-parameter objectives as input is used to adjust the electromagnetic torque in real-time and reasonably allocate the energy flow. The simulation results demonstrate that the electric and total torque output are more stable. The electric peak torque is relieved, with a corresponding increase in the percentage of electrical energy recovery. With the equal power demand, the overall efficiency of the motor working point is substantially improved, and the energy consumption rate is decreased by 24.42%. Under the active regulation of FLO-EMS, hydraulic energy is more reasonably utilized to meet the vehicle demand power while avoiding energy dissipation and waste. Moreover, this work is expected to reference the development and engineering applications of electro-hydraulic coupling systems.

AB  - Expert informants can be used as the principal information source in the modeling of socio-techno-economic systems or problems to support planning, foresight and decision-making. Such modeling is theory-driven, grounded in expert judgment and understanding, and can be contrasted with data-driven modeling approaches. Several families of approaches exist to enable expert elicited systems modeling with varying input information requirements and analytical ambitions. This paper proposes a novel modeling language and computational process, which combines aspects from various other approaches in an attempt to create a flexible and practical systems modeling approach based on expert elicitation. It is intended to have high fitness in modeling of systems that lack statistical data and exhibit low quantifiability of important system characteristics. AXIOM is positioned against Bayesian networks, cross-impact analysis, structural analysis, and morphological analysis. The modeling language and computational process are illustrated with a small example model. A software implementation is also presented.

KW  - Local quality estimates
AB  - Text-based computational approaches for assessing the quality of psychotherapy are being developed to support quality assurance and clinical training. However, due to the long durations of typical conversation based therapy sessions, and due to limited annotated modeling resources, computational methods largely rely on frequency-based lexical features or dialogue acts to assess the overall session level characteristics. In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality of transcribed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interactions. Given the richly dynamic nature of the spoken dialog within a talk therapy session, to evaluate the overall session level quality, we propose to consider modeling it as a function of local variations across the interaction. To implement that empirically, we divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments and initialize the segment-level qualities with the session-level scores. First, we produce segment embeddings by fine-tuning a BERT-based model, and predict segment-level (local) quality scores. These embeddings are used as the lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network to predict the session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, we model the global quality as a linear function of the local quality scores, which allows us to update the segment-level quality estimates based on the session-level quality prediction. These newly estimated segment-level scores benefit the BERT fine-tuning process, which in turn results in better segment embeddings. We evaluate the proposed framework on automatically derived transcriptions from real-world CBT clinical recordings to predict session-level behavior codes. The results indicate that our approach leads to improved evaluation accuracy for most codes when used for both regression and classification tasks.

The challenges include finding ways to prevent emerging economies from repeating the air pollution mistakes and harm that developed nations have experienced in arriving at solutions to air pollution problems. Other challenges include: global problems, such as long-range transport of pollutants, climate change; real-world-exposures (including indoor air pollution); improvements in technologies to remove difficult-to-treat pollutants; and addressing the growing number of mobile sources. This will require more systems thinking and sustainable, transdisciplinary solutions. The legacy of the current cadre of air pollution experts must be one of translational science and the enhancement of early air pollution education for the next generation.

AB  - Summary
Conventional thinking in modern drug discovery postulates that the design of highly selective molecules which act on a single disease-associated target will yield safer and more effective drugs. However, high clinical attrition rates and the lack of progress in developing new effective treatments for many important diseases of unmet therapeutic need challenge this hypothesis. This assumption also impinges upon the efficiency of target agnostic phenotypic drug discovery strategies, where early target deconvolution is seen as a critical step to progress phenotypic hits. In this review we provide an overview of how emerging phenotypic and pathway-profiling technologies integrate to deconvolute the mechanism-of-action of phenotypic hits. We propose that such in-depth mechanistic profiling may support more efficient phenotypic drug discovery strategies that are designed to more appropriately address complex heterogeneous diseases of unmet need.

KW  - Egocentric vision
KW  - Streaming perception
AB  - Egocentric action anticipation aims to predict the future actions the camera wearer will perform from the observation of the past. While predictions about the future should be available before the predicted events take place, most approaches do not pay attention to the computational time required to make such predictions. As a result, current evaluation schemes assume that predictions are available right after the input video is observed, i.e., presuming a negligible runtime, which may lead to overly optimistic evaluations. We propose a streaming egocentric action evaluation scheme which assumes that predictions are performed online and made available only after the model has processed the current input segment, which depends on its runtime. To evaluate all models considering the same prediction horizon, we hence propose that slower models should base their predictions on temporal segments sampled ahead of time. Based on the observation that model runtime can affect performance in the considered streaming evaluation scenario, we further propose a lightweight action anticipation model based on feed-forward 3D CNNs which is optimized using knowledge distillation techniques with a novel past-to-future distillation loss. Experiments on the three popular datasets EPIC-KITCHENS-55, EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ show that (i) the proposed evaluation scheme induces a different ranking on state-of-the-art methods as compared to classic evaluations, (ii) lightweight approaches tend to outmatch more computationally expensive ones, and (iii) the proposed model based on feed-forward 3D CNNs and knowledge distillation outperforms current art in the streaming egocentric action anticipation scenario.

AB  - This article investigates the nested relationship between graphic cues, voice, and positioning in digital discourse. The focus is on the ‘indignation mark’, or <!!1!>, an allographic sign used in German-language discussion boards on Reddit. The study's theoretical backdrop brings research on graphic practices in digitally-mediated communication into dialogue with sociolinguistic approaches to the enactment of group relations in discourse, in particular double-voicing, stylization, and positioning, thereby aiming to foster theory-building on both sides. Data is extracted from a large German-language forum (‘subreddit’) on Reddit and subjected to computational, sequential, and microlinguistic analysis. The findings show how participants in public online discussions use punctuation signs and other graphic cues to animate voices, i.e. ways of speaking that index recognizable social positions and ideologies; how these stylized voices provide a resource for positioning; and how participants display recognition of and alignment to this feature's indexical meaning. The findings also suggest that the ‘indignation mark’ is part of a wider ecology of graphic cues, which evolve constantly to enable multi-voicedness in public digital discourse. Overall, this paper aims to advance our understanding about how graphic elements of digital discourse are indexically and ideologically connected with positioning activities in online communities of practice.

AB  - A method for predicting the effect of solvent on the morphology of organic crystals is presented, providing an efficient screening tool for identifying ideal crystallization solvents. The solvent effect is estimated by the computation of chemical potentials and activity coefficients of crystal surfaces using a first principles-based statistical thermodynamics approach. Density functional theory and COSMO-RS are utilized to determine the activity coefficients of the crystal growth faces of a selection of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in solvents across a broad range of polarities. The ability of COSMO-RS to predict and quantify the effects of solvent on crystal growth and morphology is assessed using hierarchical clustering to classify the solvents according to their overall interaction strength with the crystal faces. The COSMO-RS approach allows for a physical interpretation of the predictions in terms of surface polarity and is confirmed by comparison to published experimental data. Herein a methodology is reported for automated computation of the activity coefficients of all solvent-surface pairs directly from the drug crystal structure. The procedure goes beyond the traditional trial-and-error solvent selection process and has the potential to be used as a rapid computational screening tool in pharmaceutical drug development.

AB  - The current study aims to investigate the attitudes of parents (N=1087) regarding the influence of computer games on their children's development in the following aspects: time they spend at the computer to play, types of favourite games, ways of child supervision, benefits and disadvantages of computer games. The results of the research show: 30.47% of children may access the computer anytime they want; the computer is mostly used for games (36.28%); 42.87% of parents supervise their children's activities at the computer only when they have spare time; 50% of parents allow their children to spend 1-2hours at computer games every day, while 28.54% allow 3-4hours (and more) of computer games every day. The biggest benefits of computer games, according to parents, are thinking development (9.60%), observation capacity (8.27%), and creativity (8.01%). The biggest disadvantages of computer games are the lack of physical movement (13.37%), sight disorders (13.15%) and agitation (8.58%). Parents recognize that games can have powerful effects on children, and should therefore set limits on the amount and content of games their children play. In this way, we can realize the potential benefits while minimizing the potential harms.

Despite the emergence of STEAM as a popular pedagogical approach for enhancing students’ creativity, problem-solving skills, and interest in STEM fields, the definitions and purposes of STEAM education remain ubiquitous. Therefore, the review examined descriptions of the overall purpose of STEAM education, definitions of the STEAM acronym and the ‘A’ in STEAM, creativity as a learning outcome, elements of arts education, and arts education learning outcomes. The review found a myriad of definitions of the STEAM concept in general, a variety of interpretations for the “A” in STEAM, and an overall lack of reported learning outcomes in the areas of creativity, problem-solving, and arts education. The articles also differentiate in methods for merging STEAM disciplines, described in one of five ways: transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and arts-integration. Recommendations are provided to advance both research and practice in STEAM education.

However, bilingual advantages have yet to be identified particularly on insight problems that are used as a model of creative problem solving following initial impasse. As such, the goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of language experience on problem solving performance on a matched set of insight and non-insight problems. Results demonstrate an interaction between type of problem (insight versus non-insight) and language status.

AB  - In this study, a deep learning algorithm was applied to two-dimensional magnetotelluric (MT) data inversion. Compared with the traditional linear iterative inversion methods, the MT inversion method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) does not rely on the selection of the initial model parameters and does not fall into the local optima. Although the CNN inversion models can provide a clear electrical interface division, their inversion results may remain prone to abrupt electrical interfaces as opposed to the actual underground electrical situation. To solve this issue, a neural network with a residual network architecture (ResNet-50) was constructed in this study. With the apparent resistivity and phase pseudo-section data as the inputs and with the resistivity parameters of the geoelectric model as the training labels, the modified ResNet-50 model was trained end-to-end for producing samples according to the corresponding production strategy of the study area. Through experiments, the training of the ResNet-50 with the dice loss function effectively solved the issue of over-segmentation of the electrical interface by the cross-entropy function, avoided its abrupt inversion, and overcame the computational inefficiency of the traditional iterative methods. The proposed algorithm was validated against MT data measured from a geothermal field prospect in Huanggang, Hubei Province, which showed that the deep learning method has opened up broad prospects in the field of MT data inversion.

AB  - When thinking about the future or the upcoming actions of another person, we mentally project ourselves into that alternative situation. Accumulating data suggest that envisioning the future (prospection), remembering the past, conceiving the viewpoint of others (theory of mind) and possibly some forms of navigation reflect the workings of the same core brain network. These abilities emerge at a similar age and share a common functional anatomy that includes frontal and medial temporal systems that are traditionally associated with planning, episodic memory and default (passive) cognitive states. We speculate that these abilities, most often studied as distinct, rely on a common set of processes by which past experiences are used adaptively to imagine perspectives and events beyond those that emerge from the immediate environment.

AB  - Efficient drug delivery systems (DDSs) play a pivotal role in ensuring pharmaceuticals’ targeted and effective administration. However, the intricate interplay between drug formulations and delivery systems poses challenges in their design and optimization. Simulations have emerged as indispensable tools for comprehending these interactions and enhancing DDSs performance to address this complexity. This comprehensive review explores the latest advancements in simulation techniques for DDSs and provides a detailed analysis. The review encompasses various simulation methodologies, including molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), density functional theory (DFT), machine learning (ML), and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). These techniques are critically examined in the context of drug delivery research. The article presents illustrative case studies involving liposomal, polymer-based, nano-particulate, and implantable DDSs, demonstrating the influential role of simulations in optimizing these systems. Furthermore, the review addresses the advantages and limitations of simulations in drug delivery research. It also identifies future directions for research and development, such as integrating multiple simulation techniques, refining and validating models for greater accuracy, overcoming computational limitations, and exploring applications of simulations in personalized medicine and innovative DDSs. Simulations employing various techniques like MD, MC, FEA, CFD, DFT, ML, and DPD offer crucial insights into drug behaviour, aiding in DDS design and optimization. Despite their advantages, including rapid and cost-effective screening, simulations require validation and addressing computational limitations. Future research should focus on integrating techniques, refining models, and exploring personalized medicine applications to enhance drug delivery outcomes. This paper underscores the indispensable contribution of simulations to drug research and development, emphasizing their role in providing valuable insights into drug behaviour, facilitating the development and optimization of DDSs, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. As we continue to explore and enhance simulation techniques, their impact on advancing drug discovery and improving DDSs is expected to be profound.

AB  - Shifting from a world of already-made-things to a world of things-continually-in-the-making changes everything. Psychology, like all other sciences, tries to proceed by analysis, by breaking down a living, unique, always developing organic whole into a set of general, already-existing, nameable elements. But as Bakhtin makes clear, in discussing how Dostoevsky portrays the inner dynamics of people worrying over how to act for the best in living their lives, such an itemization of merely observed behavioural characteristics leads to a degrading reification of a person's unfinalizability, of their still-developing nature. Below, I first examine the Cartesianism that still seems present in much of our thinking in social inquiry today. I then turn attention to the primacy of our living movements out in the world and their responsiveness to events occurring around us. While finally turning to the fact that, as living beings, what ‘goes on inside us’, is not so important as ‘what we go on inside of’. Although Dostoevsky portrays this indivisible, flowing reality, in terms of a set of discontinuous fragments —because that is the nature of our experience in everyday life — as hermeneutical-dialogical-relational beings, we have a basic capability of organizing them into unitary wholes which sit in the background to everything we think and do.

AB  - Students' ability to solve mathematical problems is a standard mathematical skill; however, its cognitive correlates are unclear. Thus, this study aimed to examine whether spatial processing (mental rotation, paper folding, and the Corsi blocks test) and logical reasoning (abstract and concrete syllogisms) were correlated with mathematical problem-solving (word problems and geometric proofing) for college students. The regression results showed that after controlling for gender, age, general IQ, language processing, cognitive processing (visual perception, attention, and memory skills), and number sense and arithmetic computation skills, spatial processing skills still predicted mathematical problem-solving and geometry skills in Chinese college students. Contrastingly, logical reasoning measures related to syllogisms did not predict after controlling for these variables. Further, notably, it did not correlate significantly with geometry performance when no control variables were included. Our results suggest that spatial processing is a significant component of math skills involving word and geometry problems (even after controlling for multiple key cognitive factors).

AB  - A human-centered design approach for creating science/engineering-driven solutions or innovations, referred to as “connect-the-dots,” is presented. Dots symbolize the best questions and the connections reveal the best order in which these questions should be answered. In this approach, the number of customer or user behavioral changes are critically analyzed, revealing the overall context in which the solution or innovation will operate; especially to undergraduate students creating solutions to problems from settings that are less familiar, from cultural, economic, and geopolitical viewpoints. Solutions or innovations that result in minimal user behavior changes are preferred. Additional benefits include better incorporation of systems theory thinking, ease with which team multidisciplinarity and diversity can be identified, and seamlessly integrating design and research.

AB  - Knots are very common in polymers, including DNA and protein molecules. Yet, no genuine knot has been identified in natural RNA molecules to date. Upon re-examining experimentally determined RNA 3D structures, we discovered a trefoil knot 31, the most basic non-trivial knot, in the RydC RNA. This knotted RNA is a member of a small family of short bacterial RNAs, whose secondary structure is characterized by an H-type pseudoknot. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a folding pathway of the RydC RNA that starts with a native twisted loop. Based on sequence analyses and computational RNA 3D structure predictions, we postulate that this trefoil knot is a conserved feature of all RydC-related RNAs. The first discovery of a knot in a natural RNA molecule introduces a novel perspective on RNA 3D structure formation and on fundamental research on the relationship between function and spatial structure of biopolymers.

AB  - Floods are a major threat to human existence and historically have both caused the collapse of civilizations and forced the emergence of new cultures. The physical processes of flooding are complex. Increased population, climate variability, change in catchment and channel management, modified landuse and land cover, and natural change of floodplains and river channels all lead to changes in flood dynamics, and as a direct or indirect consequence, social welfare of humans. Section 5.16.1 explores the risks and benefits brought about by floods and reviews the responses of floods and floodplains to climate and landuse change. Section 5.08.2 reviews the existing modeling tools, and the top–down and bottom–up modeling frameworks that are used to assess impacts on future floods. Section 5.08.3 discusses changing flood risk and socioeconomic vulnerability based on current trends in emerging or developing countries and presents an alternative paradigm as a pathway to resilience. Section 5.08.4 concludes the chapter by stating a portfolio of integrated concepts, measures, and avant-garde thinking that would be required to sustainably manage future flood risk.

AB  - Instituting circular economy (CE) for sustainability is the aim of taking stock of various analytical/assessment tools. A review of these tools reveals a continuing endeavor to incorporate in the procedures the systems and life cycle thinking and the triple bottom-line framework of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental). Over time, the CE tools have been modified with the incorporation of some unique attributes in the cases being studied. Life cycle assessment (LCA) remains the popular and the only standardized procedure to analyze CE issues in industries, specifically in the environmental aspect. However, consistency, measurement, and aggregation issues are the major setbacks of having an integrated LCA for economic, social, and environmental impacts. The alternative tools used across the world to study the economic, social, and environmental aspects of CE have increased in both number and sophistication. Optimization and systems models have been increasingly used on a case-based format. Although the downside is the less standardized approach with less chances of comparability in terms of results, these models have been designed appropriately to tackle challenges associated with intricate, multifaceted, and encompassing sustainability and CE issues to improve policy development. In the textile industry, LCA as a popular tool is only used for environmental sustainability assessment but not much in social and economic aspects. The Philippine textile industry still has to catch up in the application of those tools for sustainability assessment. A framework has been suggested for the country's roadmap/guide to attain circularity in textile industry operations.

AB  - Neural computations underlying cognition and behavior rely on the coordination of neural activity across multiple brain areas. Understanding how brain areas interact to process information or generate behavior is thus a central question in neuroscience. Here we provide an overview of statistical approaches for characterizing statistical dependencies in multi-region spike train recordings. We focus on two classes of models in particular: regression-based models and shared latent variable models. Regression-based models describe interactions in terms of a directed transformation of information from one region to another. Shared latent variable models, on the other hand, seek to describe interactions in terms of sources that capture common fluctuations in spiking activity across regions. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each of these approaches and future directions for the field. We intend this review to be an introduction to the statistical methods in multi-region models for computational neuroscientists and experimentalists alike.

AB  - Early life experiences are thought to have long-lasting effects on cognitive, emotional, and social function during adulthood. Changes in neuroendocrine function, particularly the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, contribute to these systems-level behavioral effects. In searching for causal mechanisms underlying these early experience effects, pioneering research has demonstrated an important role for maternal care in offspring development, and this has led to two persistent ideas that permeate current research and thinking: first, environmental impact on the developing infant is mediated through maternal care behavior; second, the more care that a mother provides, the better off her offspring. While a good beginning, the reality is likely more complex. In this review, we critically examine these ideas and propose a computationally-motivated theoretical framework, and within this framework, we consider evidence supporting a hypothesis of maternal modulation. These findings may inform policy decisions in the context of child health and development.

AB  - This paper investigates the development of an intelligent system method to address completely locked-in-syndrome (CLIS) that is caused by some illnesses such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as the most predominant type of Motor Neuron Disease (MND). In the last stages of ALS and despite the limitations in body movements, patients however will have a fully functional brain and cognitive capabilities and able to feel pain but fail to communicate. This paper aims to address the CLIS problem by utilizing EEG signals that human brain generates when thinking about a specific feeling or imagination as a way to communicate. The aim is to develop a low-cost and affordable system for patients to use to communicate with carers and family members. In this paper, the novel implementation of the ASPS (Automated Sensor and Signal Processing Selection) approach for feature extraction of EEG is presented to select the most suitable Sensory Characteristic Features (SCFs) to detect human thoughts and imaginations. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to verify the results. The findings show that EEG signals are able to capture imagination information that can be used as a means of communication; and the ASPS approach allows the selection of the most important features for reliable communication. This paper explains the implementation and validation of ASPS approach in brain signal classification for bespoke arrangement. Hence, future work will present the results of relatively high number of volunteers, sensors and signal processing methods.

AB  - Fuzzy approach is frequently used for selection of manufacturing technology. However, the application of the fuzzy tool for choosing the appropriate remanufacturing technology is seldom applied. This study applies the fuzzy logic approach for the selection of technology in order to minimize vagueness in decision making, thereby making results more similar to experts’ thinking. Through elicitation of experts’ inputs, six cleaning technologies were evaluated and ranked appropriately, using criteria of technology cost, operating cost, and disposal effect. Moreover, the technology selection was computed through experts’ opinion using the fuzzy logic inference system. The results show that when technical function of the technology is at the low level of 20%, the technology quality is as low as 15%, and the technology flexibility is rated as low at 25%; then the technical adequacy of the assessed technology will be as low as 10%. The fuzzy approach shows that technology performance is largely impacted by criteria far beyond the technology itself, including purchasing cost, disposal cost, operating cost, and other support functions to compliment experience of experts. Despite the fact that decision makers are appropriately selecting technology, the application of the fuzzy logic tool helps to accommodate vagueness, ambiguity, and subjective views of experts. Notwithstanding the robustness of the approach, application of software to help selection of technology is more reliable and accurate, reduce time of decision, and can be accessed worldwide.

AB  - Numbers of Earth Observation (EO) satellites have increased exponentially over the past decade reaching the current population of 1193 (January 2023). Consequently, EO data volumes have mushroomed and data storage and processing have migrated to the cloud. Whilst attention has been given to the launch and in-orbit environmental impacts of satellites, EO data environmental footprints have been overlooked. These issues require urgent attention given data centre water and energy consumption, high carbon emissions for computer component manufacture, and difficulty of recycling computer components. Doing so is essential if the environmental good of EO is to withstand scrutiny. We provide the first assessment of the EO data life-cycle and estimate that the current size of the global EO data collection is ~807 PB, increasing by ~100 PB/year. Storage of this data volume generates annual CO2 equivalent emissions of 4101 t. Major state-funded EO providers use 57 of their own data centres globally, and a further 178 private cloud services, with considerable duplication of datasets across repositories. We explore scenarios for the environmental cost of performing EO functions on the cloud compared to desktop machines. A simple band arithmetic function applied to a Landsat 9 scene using Google Earth Engine (GEE) generated CO2 equivalent (e) emissions of 0.042–0.69 g CO2e (locally) and 0.13–0.45 g CO2e (European data centre; values multiply by nine for Australian data centre). Computation-based emissions scale rapidly for more intense processes and when testing code. When using cloud services such as GEE, users have no choice about the data centre used and we push for EO providers to be more transparent about the location-specific impacts of EO work, and to provide tools for measuring the environmental cost of cloud computation. The EO community as a whole needs to critically consider the broad suite of EO data life-cycle impacts.

AB  - Current thinking about human memory is dominated by distinctions between episodic and semantic memory and between short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). However, many memory phenomena seem to cut across these distinctions. This article attempts to set the groundwork for the issues that need to be resolved in generating an integrated model of long-term memory that incorporates semantic, episodic, and short-term memory. We contrast Nairne’s (2002, Annual Review of Psychology) consensus account of short-term memory with a relatively generic theory of an integrated episodic-semantic memory. The later consists primarily of a list of principles which we and others argue are necessary to include in any theory of long-term memory. We then add some more specific assumptions to outline a modern theory of forgetting. We then turn to the issue of much of the phenomena thought to necessitate a dedicated short-term memory can be explained by an integrated theory of episodic and semantic memory. Our conclusion is that an integrated theory of long-term memory must be augmented to explain a small number of outstanding memory phenomena. Finally, we ask whether the augmentation needs to involve a dedicated mnemonic system, or sensory or language-based systems, which also have mnemonic capabilities.

AB  - Using appropriate tools strategically to aid in problem solving is a crucial skill identified in K-12 mathematics curriculum standards. As more assessments transition from paper-and-pencil to digital formats, a variety of interactive tools have been made available to test takers in digital testing platforms. Using onscreen calculators as an example, this study illustrates how process data obtained from student interactions with a digitally-based large-scale assessment can be leveraged to explore how and how well test takers use interactive tools and unveil their mathematical problem-solving processes and strategies. Specifically, sequence mining techniques using the longest common subsequence were applied on process data collected from a nationally representative sample who took the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics assessment to examine patterns of eighth-grade students’ calculator-use behaviors and the content of calculator input across a series of items. Sequences of keystrokes executed on the onscreen calculator by test takers were compared to reference sequences identified by content experts as proficient and efficient use to infer how well and how consistently the calculator was used. Results indicated that calculator-use behaviors and content differed by item characteristics. Students were more likely to use calculators on calculation-demanding items that involve intensive and complex computations than on items that involve simple or no computation. Using the calculator on more calculation-demanding items and using it in a manner that is more efficient and more similar to reference sequences on these items were related to higher mathematical proficiency. Findings have implications for assessment design and can be used in educational practices to provide educators with actionable process-related information on tool use and problem solving.

AB  - Mathematical problem-solving is necessary to encounter professional, 21st-century, and everyday challenges. The relevant context of mathematical problem-solving is related to science, which is presented using natural language. Mathematical problem-solving requires both mathematical skills and nonmathematical skills, e.g., science knowledge and text comprehension skills. Thus, several internal and external factors affect success in mathematical problem-solving. In this study, we investigated the cognitive (i.e., mathematics domain-specific prior knowledge (DSPK), science background knowledge, and text comprehension skills) and socioeconomic status (SES) (i.e., parents' educational level and family income) factors that affect students' mathematical problem-solving skills. The data considered in this study included tests, documents, and a questionnaire from grade seven to nine students (n = 1067). In addition, a theoretical model was constructed using structural equation modeling. We found that this model was close to satisfying the critical values of fit indices. The model was then modified by deleting the nonsignificant paths, and the modified model exhibited a better fit. We found that most of the exploratory variables directly affected mathematical problem-solving skills, with the exception of the parents' educational levels. The strongest factor was mathematics DSPK. Both the father’s and mother’s educational levels indirectly influenced mathematical problem-solving skills through family income. In addition, text comprehension skills indirectly impacted mathematical problem-solving skills with science background knowledge acting as a mediator.

In Studies 2 and 3, participants evaluated policy decisions to knowingly do harm to a resource to mitigate greater harm or to merely allow the greater harm to happen. When evaluated in isolation, approval for decisions to harm was affected by endorsement of moral rules and by thinking style. When both choices were evaluated simultaneously, total harm – but not the do/allow distinction – influenced rated approval. These studies suggest that moral rules play an important, but context-sensitive role in moral cognition, and offer an account of when emotional reactions to perceived moral violations receive less weight than consideration of costs and benefits in moral judgment and decision making.

AB  - Significant circular hotspot detection (SCHD) aims at identifying those circular regions in a spatial space where the occurrence of a particular activity is uncommonly higher than the surrounding areas. Plentiful societal applications make SCHD a problem of utmost interest. In many domains, detection of the most significant circular hotspot (MSCHD) is of further usefulness. Well-timed detection of the most significant hotspot helps crucially for short term response planning (STRP) in situations like a disease outbreak, police vigilance, etc. State of the art methods like SaTScan, identify circular hotspots by listing all possible circles in the search area, followed by a statistical significance test, making it a very high computational cost problem. Considering their high costs, these methods are inefficient in applications related to STRP. To reduce the computational time of SaTScan, two randomized versions of the SaTScan algorithm are presented in this paper. Further, the MSCHD problem is modeled as an optimization problem and three improved variants of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) namely I-PSO, HCL-PSO and Ensemble PSO are applied to detect the most significant hotspots. The comparative and sensitivity analysis are performed using synthetic datasets. The comparative analysis of SaTScan and the presented PSO based schemes is made in terms of the quality of identified hotspots and the computational time. Results reveal that the PSO based schemes (I-PSO, HCL-PSO, and Ensemble PSO) are promising and far efficient than randomized and traditional SaTScan algorithms. Further, for the datasets containing only a single hotspot, the performance of all PSO based schemes is at par with each other. However, for datasets with more than one hotspot in the study area, HCL-PSO has lower average rank than I-PSO and Ensemble PSO schemes and hence seems more promising for MSCHD. The superiority of HCL-PSO based hotspot detection is also validated using Friedman Test. Finally, the presented schemes are applied to the case study of Chicago city for identification of different types of crime hotspots.

AB  - Many researchers in different disciplines have independently concluded that brains are, possibly among other things, vector processing devices. In this paper we offer support for this hypothesis coming from a new perspective. Namely, we test it against some known anomalies in the processing by schizophrenic patients of certain logical tasks: they perform better at them than normal controls, despite the observation that they do not generally employ “normal” or “commonsense” logic. On the assumption that they are compelled to use the intrinsic logic of the brain instead of commonsense logic, and that this logic is linear or quantum-like, we are able to resolve these and other anomalies. Our conclusions support the idea that human brains (at least) perform intrinsic logical operations according to the dictates of a linear (or Grassmannian, or quantum-like) logic rather than “classical” or Aristotelian logic (which seems not to be intrinsic to brains, these having evolved under the pressure of different constraints). If this is the case, then commonsense logic must be acquired through experience and the construction of contexts, an ability schizophrenic patients seem to lack, and who are consequently compelled to rely on the intrinsic logic, which is quantum-like and more efficient at certain tasks. Moreover, the proclivity toward errors of von Domarus type (namely the inference that shared attributes imply identity), which seems to be endemic to human thinking and has been discussed in connection with schizophrenia, is also explained on this basis.

AB  - Remote sensing image fusion aims at fusing high spatial resolution single-band panchromatic (PAN) image with spectrally informative multispectral (MS) image to generate panchromatic sharpened image with high resolution and color information, it is also called pansharpening. Most of the proposed single convolutional neural network (CNN) or transformer-based pansharpening methods own several problems, such as inability to acquire long-range features or difficult to train, resulting the loss of spatial details and colors. In addition, the computational complexity of transformer cannot be ignored. In this work, we propose a dual-branch hybrid CNN-Transformer network (DBCT-Net) that utilizes the local specificity of CNN and models the global dependencies by transformer. First, a multi-branch dense connected block (MDCB-4) network is designed to obtain spectral and textural information in MS and PAN images, respectively. Next, an encoder–decoder transformer based on the self-attention and co-attention modules is able to inject the missing local and global information, which can further enhance the results. It is worth noting that an inverted multi-head transposed attention (IMTA) is applied here to build attention maps from feature dimensions, which greatly reduces the computation time. Finally, an image reconstruction module is employed to effectively fuse the acquired texture and spectral features. Furthermore, to generate visually better pansharpened images, we propose a combined loss function that includes a focal frequency loss. Extensive experiments on WorldView II (WV2), GF-2,and QuickBird (QB) datasets show that DBCT-Net can perform better in spatial preservation and spectral feature recovery.

AB  - We begin by illustrating that long before the cognitive revolution, social psychology focused on topics pertaining to what is now known as social cognition: people’s subjective interpretations of social situations and the concepts and cognitive processes underlying these interpretations. We then examine two questions: whether social cognition entails characteristic concepts and cognitive processes, and how social processes might themselves shape and constrain cognition. We suggest that social cognition relies heavily on generic cognition but also on unique concepts (e.g., agent, intentionality) and unique processes (e.g., projection, imitation, joint attention). We further suggest that social processes play a prominent role in the development and unfolding of several generic cognitive processes, including learning, attention, and memory. Finally, we comment on the prospects of a recently developing approach to the study of social cognition (social neuroscience) and two potential future directions (computational social cognition and social–cognitive robotics).

AB  - Reflection is a key activity in self-regulated learning (SRL) and a critical part of health professions education that supports the development of effective lifelong-learning health professionals. Despite widespread use and plentiful theoretical models, empirical understanding of and support for reflection in health professions education remains limited due to simple manual assessment and rare feedback to students. Recent moves to digital reflection practices offer opportunities to computationally study and support reflection as a part of SRL. The critical task in such an endeavor, and the goal of this paper, is to align high-level reflection qualities that are valued conceptually with low-level features in the data that are possible to extract computationally. This paper approaches this goal by (a) developing a unified framework for conceptualizing reflection analytics in health professions education and (b) empirically examining potential data features through which these elements can be assessed. Synthesizing the prior literature yields a conceptual framework for health professions reflection comprised of six elements: Description, Analysis, Feelings, Perspective, Evaluation, and Outcome. These elements then serve as the conceptual grounding for the computational analysis in which 27 dental students’ reflections (in six reflective statement types) over the course of 4 years were examined using selected LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) indices. Variation in elements of reflection across students, years, and reflection-types supports use of the multi-dimensional analysis framework to (a) increase precision of research claims; (b) evaluate whether reflection activities are engaged in as intended; and (c) diagnose aspects of reflection in which specific students need support. Implications for the development of health professions reflection analytics that can contribute to SRL and promising areas for future research are discussed.

AB  - In the quest to achieve sustainable development goals, developments in sustainability-oriented chemical process design are key to innovation in the chemical industry, especially important for processes aiming for sustainable fuels. One of the greatest challenges is the difficulty of modeling the highly complex interactions among the design variables, such as catalyst technology attributes, and greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the computational aids crucial to deal with the complexity of chemical processes require data that is either unavailable or uncertain at an early stage of design. The multistage integrated system for sustainable design proposed in this paper boosts these computational aids by applying data science techniques to allow uncertainty to be handled more efficiently, thereby facilitating the modeling of the interactions between the properties of new materials or processes and sustainability indicators. In this system, current data connectivity methods are used to find paths of correlation among catalysts properties and greenhouse gas emissions. The key feature of the proposed system relies on the integration through multiple stages of Fuzzy Inference systems and a data-driven technique for Emissions Analytics, FIEMA.11FIEMA: Fuzzy Inference and Emission Analytics. The algorithm in FIEMA provides a semi-supervised learning approach to emission analytics: it determines data clusters by a C-means algorithm and subsequently builds fuzzy sets for multiple stages of input–output inference. The proposed FIEMA system was demonstrated in an effort to determine the optimal configurations of the properties of catalysts to minimize the probability of associated greenhouse gas emissions for a methanol production process. The results showed the potential of this approach to reduce the search space of catalyst material designs by suggesting promising configurations for oxygen storage capacity, mechanical strength, lifetime, size, and poisoning level. The research impacts of this study contribute to the development of clean fuels by a computationally-efficient system for early design, and by the determination of catalysts development paths that assure an actual reduction of the life-cycle emissions.

AB  - The detection of objects with multi-orientations and multi-scales in aerial images is receiving increasing attention because of numerous useful applications in computer vision, image understanding, satellite remote sensing and surveillance. However, such detection can be exceedingly challenging because of a birds eye view, multi-scale rotating objects with large aspect ratios, dense distributions and extremely imbalanced categories. Despite the considerable progress that has been made, detection performance falls considerably below that required for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an accurate and fast end-to-end detector to address the aforementioned challenges. Our contributions are threefold. First, inspired by the looking and thinking twice mechanism, recursive neural networks and the DetectoRS detector, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based architecture by introducing the recursive feature pyramid into a single-stage object detection framework. The improved backbone network can generate increasingly powerful multi-scale representations for classification and regression. Second, we propose a refined single-stage detector with feature recursion and refinement for rotating objects. Third, we use instance balance to improve focal loss, thereby optimizing the loss in the correct direction. Extensive experiments on two challenging aerial image object detection public datasets, DOTA and HRSC2016, show that the proposed R4Det detector achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy while running very fast. Moreover, further experiments show that our detector is more robust to adversarial image patch attacks than the previous state-of-art detector.

AB  - We present here a view of the firing patterns of hippocampal cells that is contrary, both functionally and anatomically, to conventional wisdom. We argue that the hippocampus responds to efference copies of goals encoded elsewhere; and that it uses these to detect and resolve conflict or interference between goals in general. While goals can involve space, hippocampal cells do not encode spatial (or other special types of) memory, as such. We also argue that the transverse circuits of the hippocampus operate in an essentially homogeneous way along its length. The apparently different functions of different parts (e.g. memory retrieval versus anxiety) result from the different (situational/motivational) inputs on which those parts perform the same fundamental computational operations. On this view, the key role of the hippocampus is the iterative adjustment, via Papez-like circuits, of synaptic weights in cell assemblies elsewhere.

AB  - The developmental process is remarkably dynamic. The process is both a biological one and an environmental one with both factors frequently contributing to the output of increasingly sophisticated and abstract reasoning behavior. Children begin with a process of cortical thickening as large numbers of synaptic connections are formed. From age three onward, the cortex undergoes a tuning process as some synaptic connections strengthen and others weaken. The net result of this process is a decrease in cortical volume from age 5 through 20. Children's thinking is guided by a variety of factors. The context of a problem becomes a significant factor in determining how children will reason and developmental reasoning studies require sensitivity toward making the experimental stimuli understandable and interesting to the child. Children exhibit some competencies in causal reasoning and learning from a very young age. Children show increasing reasoning abilities as they develop. Skills such as relational and analogical reasoning grow during the elementary school years and are supported by increases in cognitive control and decreases in impulsivity. The child becomes less concrete in how he or she views and interacts with the world. This increasing abstraction ability encompasses semantic knowledge, deduction, and moral thinking.

AB  - We describe a “centipede’s dilemma” that faces the sciences of human interaction. Research on human interaction has been involved in extensive theoretical debate, although the vast majority of research tends to focus on a small set of human behaviors, cognitive processes, and interactive contexts. The problem is that naturalistic human interaction must integrate all of these factors simultaneously, and grander theoretical mitigation cannot come only from focused experimental or computational agendas. We look to dynamical systems theory as a framework for thinking about how these multiple behaviors, processes, and contexts can be integrated into a broader account of human interaction. By introducing and utilizing basic concepts of self-organization and synergy, we review empirical work that shows how human interaction is flexible and adaptive and structures itself incrementally during unfolding interactive tasks, such as conversation, or more focused goal-based contexts. We end on acknowledging that dynamical systems accounts are very short on concrete models, and we briefly describe ways that theoretical frameworks could be integrated, rather than endlessly disputed, to achieve some success on the centipede’s dilemma of human interaction.

AB  - Homo sapiens is currently believed to have evolved in the African savannah several hundreds of thousands of years ago. Since then, human societies have become, through technological innovation and application, powerful influencers of the planet’s ecological, hydrological and meteorological systems – for good and ill. They have experimented with many different systems of governance, in order to manage their societies and the environments they inhabit – using computer simulations as a tool to help make decisions concerning highly complex systems, is only the most recent of these. In questioning whether, when and how computer simulations should play a role in determining decision-making in these systems of governance, it is also worth reflecting on whether, when and how humans, or groups of humans, have the capability to make such decisions without the aid of such technology. This paper looks at and compares the characteristics of natural language-based and simulation-based decision-making. We argue that computational tools for decision-making can and should be complementary to natural language discourse approaches, but that this requires that both systems are used with their limitations in mind. All tools and approaches – physical, social and mental – have dangers when used inappropriately, but it seems unlikely humankind can survive without them. The challenge is how to do so.

AB  - The most important design parameters of each phase-locked loop (PLL) are the local and global stability properties, and the pull-in range. To extend the pull-in range, engineers often use type 2 PLLs. However, the engineering design relies on approximations which prevent a full exploitation of the benefits of type 2 PLLs. Using an exact mathematical model and relying on a rigorous mathematical thinking this problem is revisited here and the stability and pull-in properties of the third-order type 2 analog PLLs are determined. Both the local and global stability conditions are derived. As a new idea, the harmonic balance method is used to derive the global stability conditions. That approach offers an extra advantage, the birth of unwanted oscillations can be also predicted. As a verification it is shown that the sufficient conditions of global stability derived by the harmonic balance method proposed here and the well-known direct Lyapunov approach coincide with each other, moreover, the harmonic balance predicts the birth of oscillations in the gap between the local and global stability conditions. Finally, an example when the conditions for local and global stability coincide, is considered.

AB  - This chapter aims to highlight the core principles of pharmaceutical toxicology. It is an interrelated discipline that needs to be applied at all stages of the drug development process to appropriately characterise the safety profile of a drug compound and acknowledge the uncertainties associated with models available. With a strategic mindset, the preclinical safety activities aim to build a comprehensive profile of the drug so that potential hazards can be identified and the risks for healthy trial subjects or patients quantified, and, if necessary, suitable means for eliminating or reducing unacceptable risks can be put in place. We focus on the 2 distinct phases of pharmaceutical toxicology:  Discovery toxicology and regulatory toxicology, to explain how the thinking is built upon at each stage and how the mindset shifts from enabling the selection of an optimally derisked clinical candidate through to thorough risk characterisation and management of those risks for clinical development. Considering attrition due to safety reasons, whether clinical or preclinical, is one of the main reasons for drug project failure, safety assessments should be viewed with equal importance as drug efficacy assessments.

AB  - Identifying Disaster resilience indices (DRI) for cities and communities remains a common approach for assessing their structural ability and inherent capacity to cope with, recover from, and adapt to disasters. Particularly popular are composite DRI methodologies that are quantitative, top-down, and geographically mappable. DRI have become more comprehensive as the complexity of urban systems is increasingly acknowledged. However, DRI remain criticized as static, reductive, and inadequate when viewed under a complexity paradigm, which views urban systems as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), where observed properties (like resilience) emerge from many interactions among heterogenous agents in a network. Literature reviews have covered the state and trends for DRI development. Our objective is to synthesize literature at the nexus of these reviews, CAS, and Socio-ecological Systems (SES) to determine the extent to which commonly adopted indicators relate to widely accepted tenets of CAS. Findings show that DRI indicators usually relate more closely to temporal snapshots of vulnerability, and alternative framings of current indicators along with interdisciplinary approaches could better capture CAS aspects of urban resilience. Research and development should strive to develop DRI based on underlying principles of CAS and SES, and consider adapting top-down quantitative approaches with thick data, network models, and mixed-method triangulations. Explicitly associating complexity theory with DRI can (i) help researchers in socio-technical and socio-ecological domains develop improved resilience indicators and assessment methods that are clearly differentiated from vulnerability metrics, and (ii) guide policy and decision-makers, amid future uncertainty, to better identify, implement and track capacity-enhancing measures.

AB  - Predicting effective thermal conductivity by solving a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) defined on a high-resolution Representative Volume Element (RVE) is a computationally intensive task. In this paper, we tackle the task by proposing an efficient and implementation-friendly computational method that can fully leverage the computing power offered by hardware accelerators, namely, graphical processing units (GPUs). We first employ the Two-Point Flux-Approximation scheme to discretize the PDE and then utilize the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve the resulting algebraic linear system. The construction of the preconditioner originates from FFT-based homogenization methods, and an engineered linear programming technique is utilized to determine the homogeneous reference parameters. The fundamental observation presented in this paper is that the preconditioner system can be effectively solved using multiple Fast Cosine Transformations (FCT) and parallel tridiagonal matrix solvers. Regarding the fact that default multiple FCTs are unavailable on the CUDA platform, we detail how to derive FCTs from FFTs with nearly optimal memory usage. Numerical experiments including the stability comparison with standard preconditioners are conducted for 3D RVEs. Our performance reports indicate that the proposed method can achieve a 5-fold acceleration on the GPU platform over the pure CPU platform and solve the problems with 5123 degrees of freedom and reasonable contrast ratios in less than 30 s.

KW  - Classification
AB  - In recent years, numerous studies have examined the chemical compounds of petrol and petrol data for forensic research. Standard quantitative methods often assume that the variables or compounds do not have compositional constraints or are not part of a constrained whole, operating within an Euclidean vector space. However, chemical compounds are typically part of a whole, and the appropriate vector space for their analysis is the simplex. Biased and arbitrary results result when statistical analysis are applied on such data without proper pre-processing of such data. Compositional analysis of data has not yet been considered in forensic science. Therefore, we compare classical statistical analysis as applied in forensic research and the new proposed paradigm of compositional data analysis (CoDa). It is demonstrated how such analysis improves the analysis in petrol and forensic science. Our study shows how principal component analysis (PCA) and classification results are affected by the preprocessing steps performed on the raw data. Our results indicate that results from a log ratio analysis provides a better separation between subgroups of the data and leads to an easier interpretation of the results. In addition, with a compositional analysis a higher classification accuracy is obtained. Even a non-linear classification method - in our case a random forest - was shown to perform poorly when applied without using compositional methods. Moreover, normalization of samples due to laboratory/unit-of-measurement effects is no longer necessary, since the composition of an observation is in compositional thinking equivalent to a multiple of it, because the used (log) ratios on raw and log ratio transformed data are equal. Petrol data from different petrol stations in Brazil are used for the demonstration. This data is highly susceptible to counterfeit petrol. Forensic analysis of its chemical elements requires non-biased statistical analysis designed for compositional data to detect fraud. Based on these results, we recommend the use of compositional data methods for gasoline and petrol chemical element analysis and gasoline product characterization, authentication and fraud detection in forensic sciences.

AB  - Individuals exhibit theory of mind, attributing beliefs, intent, and mental states to others as explanations of observed actions. Dennett's intentional stance offers an analogous abstraction for computational agents seeking to understand, explain, or predict others' behaviors. These recognized theories provide a formal basis to ongoing investigations of recursive modeling. We review and situate various frameworks for recursive modeling that have been studied in game- and decision- theories, and have yielded methods useful to AI researchers. Sustained attention given to these frameworks has produced new analyses and methods with an aim toward making recursive modeling practicable. Indeed, we also review some emerging uses and the insights these yielded, which are indicative of pragmatic progress in this area. The significance of these frameworks is that higher-order reasoning is critical to correctly recognizing others' intent or outthinking opponents. Such reasoning has been utilized in academic, business, military, security, and other contexts both to train and inform decision-making agents in organizational and strategic contexts, and also to more realistically predict and best respond to other agents' intent.

This work report the application of the instantaneous space phasors and the instantaneous complex power in observing performances of the distribution networks with dispersed generators in steady state. New IEEE apparent power definition, the so-called Buchholz–Goodhue effective apparent power, as well as new proposed power quality (oscillation) index in the three-phase distribution systems with unbalanced loads and dispersed generators, are applied. Results obtained from several case studies using IEEE 34 nodes test network are presented and discussed.

AB  - Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are constantly prone to failures during their lifespan, causing breakdowns, high energy bills, and indoor discomfort. In addition to correctly identifying these defects, fault detection, and diagnostic studies should be able to anticipate and predict the anomalies before they occur for efficient maintenance. Therefore, this study introduces an efficient self-learning predictive maintenance system, CACMMS (Cloud Air Conditioning Monitoring & Management System), designed to anticipate refrigerant leaks in VRF systems. Unlike previous efforts, this system leverages advanced fault detection and diagnosis strategies in a real existing building to enhance prediction accuracy. The study employed three noise filtering models (Kalman filter, moving average, S-G smoothing) in the preprocessing phase. Ten features were selected for assessment, and four machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine) were compared. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, computation time as well and confusion matrix were used as performance indicators and metrics to evaluate and choose the best performant model. Results indicated that decision tree and random forest models achieved over 95 % accuracy with execution times between 0.70 s and 3.32 s, outperforming K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine models. These findings highlight the system’s potential to reduce downtime and energy costs through effective predictive maintenance.

AB  - People’s causal judgments are susceptible to the action effect, whereby they judge actions to be more causal than inactions. We offer a new explanation for this effect, the counterfactual explanation: people judge actions to be more causal than inactions because they are more inclined to consider the counterfactual alternatives to actions than to consider counterfactual alternatives to inactions. Experiment 1a conceptually replicates the original action effect for causal judgments. Experiment 1b confirms a novel prediction of the new explanation, the reverse action effect, in which people judge inactions to be more causal than actions in overdetermination cases. Experiment 2 directly compares the two effects in joint-causation and overdetermination scenarios and conceptually replicates them with new scenarios. Taken together, these studies provide support for the new counterfactual explanation for the action effect in causal judgment.

We present a model for the problem in fuzzy random environment in which the objective value is computed by conditional value at risk criterion. Then, we show that the problem is NP-hard under this criterion. Therefore, a new hybrid modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the approximate optimal solution of the proposed model. Finally, computational experiments are given to illustrate high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has impacted in analytical chemistry changing the way of thinking processes and methods. It is important for analytical chemists to consider how sample preparation can integrate the basic concepts of Green Chemistry. In this sense, the replacement of traditional organic solvents is of utmost importance. Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) have come to light as a green alternative. In the last few years, a growing number of contributions have applied these natural solvents proving their efficiency in terms of extraction ability, analyte stabilization capacity and detection compatibility. However, the arising question that has to be answered is: the use of NADES is enough to green an extraction process? This review presents an overview of knowledge regarding sustainability of NADES-based extraction procedures, focused on reported literature within the timeframe spanning from 2011 up to date. The contributions were analyzed from a green perspective in terms of energy, time, sample and solvent consumption. Moreover, we include a critical analysis to clarify whether the use of NADES as extraction media is enough for greening an analytical methodology; strategies to make them even greener are also presented. Finally, recent trends and future perspectives on how NADES-based extraction approaches in combination with computational methodologies can contribute are discussed.

AB  - Mechanically-interlocked molecules (MIMs) are at the basis of artificial molecular machines and are attracting increasing interest for various applications, from catalysis to drug delivery and nanoelectronics. MIMs are composed of mechanically-interconnected molecular sub-parts that can move with respect to each other, imparting these systems innately dynamical behaviors and interesting stimuli-responsive properties. The rational design of MIMs with desired functionalities requires studying their dynamics at sub-molecular resolution and on relevant timescales, which is challenging experimentally and computationally. Here, we combine molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations to reconstruct the thermodynamics and kinetics of different types of MIMs at atomistic resolution under different conditions. As representative case studies, we use rotaxanes and molecular shuttles substantially differing in structure, architecture, and dynamical behavior. Our computational approach provides results in agreement with the available experimental evidence and a direct demonstration of the critical effect of the solvent on the dynamics of the MIMs. At the same time, our simulations unveil key factors controlling the dynamics of these systems, providing submolecular-level insights into the mechanisms and kinetics of shuttling. Reconstruction of the free-energy profiles from the simulations reveals details of the conformations of macrocycles on the binding site that are difficult to access via routine experiments and precious for understanding the MIMs' behavior, while their decomposition in enthalpic and entropic contributions unveils the mechanisms and key transitions ruling the intermolecular movements between metastable states within them. The computational framework presented herein is flexible and can be used, in principle, to study a variety of mechanically-interlocked systems.

AB  - Machine understanding and thinking require prior knowledge consisting of explicit and implicit knowledge. The current knowledge base contains various explicit knowledge but not implicit knowledge. As part of implicit knowledge, the typical characteristics of the things referred to by the concept are available by concept cognition for knowledge graphs. Therefore, this paper attempts to realize concept cognition for knowledge graphs from the perspective of mining multigranularity decision rules. Specifically, (1) we propose a novel multigranularity three-way decision model that merges the ideas of multigranularity (i.e., from coarse granularity to fine granularity) and three-way decision (i.e., acceptance, rejection, and deferred decision). (2) Based on the multigranularity three-way decision model, an algorithm for mining multigranularity decision rules is proposed. (3) The monotonicity of positive or negative granule space ensured that the positive (or negative) granule space from coarser granularity does not need to participate in the three-classification process at a finer granularity, which accelerates the process of mining multigranularity decision rules. Moreover, the experimental results show that the multigranularity decision rule is better than the two-way decision rule, frequent decision rule and single granularity decision rule, and the monotonicity of positive or negative granule space can accelerate the process of mining multigranularity decision rules.

Convolutional neural networks for image recognition through deep learning has been modeled to determine good performance with respect to digital image recognition, especially in medical areas, which is a classic problem of computational classification. In this context, an artificial intelligent cognitive approach was developed achieving an accuracy of 84.19%, which used Python employing Jupyter Notebook, with a dataset of 12,500 medical digital images of human blood smear fields of nonpathologic leukocytes.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe neurological and physiological syndrome that perverts a patient’s perception of reality. SCZ exhibits several symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, aberrant behavior, and thinking. It affects their professional, academic, personal, and social lives. Neurologists use a variety of verbal and visual tests to determine SCZ. However, these methods are laborious, time-consuming, superficial, and vulnerable to mistakes. Therefore, it is necessary to create an automated model for SCZ detection. Convolutional neural networks have swiftly established themselves in the field of mental health care due to the growth of deep learning in recent decades. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data records the variations in the neural dynamics of human memory. Using EEG data, this study proposes an automatic SCZ detection method using separable convolution attention network (SCZ-SCAN). The proposed network employs depth-wise separable convolution and attention networks on high-level and low-level to aggregate characteristics of 2-D scalogram images acquired from the continuous wavelet transform. The depth-wise separable convolutions help to create a lightweight framework, while attention techniques concentrate on significant features and reduce futile computations by removing the transmission of irrelevant features. The proposed approach has an average classification accuracy of 99% and 95% on the IBIB-PAN and EEG data from the basic sensory task in SZ dataset. Moreover, statistical hypothesis testing is performed using Wilcoxon’s Rank-Sum test to signify the model performance and it proves that SCZ-SCAN is statistically efficient to nine cutting-edge methods. Experimental results show that the PSFAN statistically defeats 11 contemporary methods, proving its effectiveness for medical industrial applications.

We describe our design process, present the final proposal, reflect on the usefulness of such tools for early-stage design, and discuss implications for future research and practice. By analysing the results from training the text-to-text generators we could establish a specific design brief that informed the final concept. The results from the image-to-image generator gave an overview of the shape grammars of previous submissions. All results were intriguing and can assist creativity and in this way, the tools were useful for gaining insight into historical architectural data, helped shape a specific design brief, and provoked new ideas. By reflecting on our design process, we argue that the use of language when employing such tools takes a new role and that three layers of language intertwined in our work: architectural discourse, programming languages, and annotations. We present a map that unfolds how these layers came together as a contribution to making machine learning more explainable for creatives.

AB  - Digital well-being traditionally means limiting the effects on individuals of technology abuses. However, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. Within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. It, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. By presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being.

AB  - Life scientists today cannot hope to read everything relevant to their research. Emerging text-mining tools can help by identifying topics and distilling statements from books and articles with increased accuracy. Researchers often organize these statements into ontologies, consistent systems of reality claims. Like scientific thinking and interchange, however, text-mined information (even when accurately captured) is complex, redundant, sometimes incoherent, and often contradictory: it is rooted in a mixture of only partially consistent ontologies. We review work that models scientific reason and suggest how computational reasoning across ontologies and the broader distribution of textual statements can assess the certainty of statements and the process by which statements become certain. With the emergence of digitized data regarding networks of scientific authorship, institutions, and resources, we explore the possibility of accounting for social dependences and cultural biases in reasoning models. Computational reasoning is starting to fill out ontologies and flag internal inconsistencies in several areas of bioscience. In the not too distant future, scientists may be able to use statements and rich models of the processes that produced them to identify underexplored areas, resurrect forgotten findings and ideas, deconvolute the spaghetti of underlying ontologies, and synthesize novel knowledge and hypotheses.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between CO2 emissions by GDP, population, energy production, and consumption in the United States, China, Romania, and Thailand economies from 1990 to 2019. It evaluates the phenomenon of catch-up growth, which transpires when an lagging economy goes through an expansionary phase after a period of below-average performance. We used the stochastic model to illustrate in terms of alpha and beta decoupling techniques. The outcomes validated by positive and negative decoupling attitudes play a crucial role in predicting a rise in CO2 emissions owing to oil, gas, and coal use in comparison to Romania. Thailand and Romania have a more viable road to sustainability than the United States and China. The United States and China appear to have an antagonistic relationship, as suggested by decoupling attitudes. Thailand and Romania are considered to be highly environmentally sustainable countries on account of their minimal carbon emissions, efficient energy usage, and forward-thinking environmental policies. Accordingly, policy recommendations are offered based on CO2 emissions and effective mitigation policies, since this allows for determining which countries with high emissions need technological advances, best practices, and intersectoral policies.

AB  - Research on artificial intelligence and research on human intelligence rely on similar conceptual foundations and have long inspired each other [1,2•]. However, achieving concrete synergy has been difficult, with one obstacle being a lack of alignment of the tasks used in both fields. Artificial intelligence research has traditionally focused on tasks that are challenging to solve, often using human performance as a benchmark to surpass [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. By contrast, cognitive science and psychology have moved towards tasks that are simple enough to allow for detailed computational modeling of people’s choices. These divergent objectives have led to a divide in the complexity of tasks studied, both in perception and cognition. The purpose of this paper is to explore the middle ground: are there tasks that are reasonably attractive to both fields and could provide fertile ground for synergy?

AB  - The clinical and administrative processes in today's healthcare environment are becoming increasingly complex. Multiple providers, new technology, competition, and the growing ubiquity of information all contribute to the notion of health care as a complex system. A complex system (CS) is characterized by a highly connected network of entities (e.g., physical objects, people or groups of people) from which higher order behavior emerges. Research in the transdisciplinary field of CS has focused on the use of computational modeling and simulation as a methodology for analyzing CS behavior. The creation of virtual worlds through computer simulation allows researchers to analyze multiple variables simultaneously and begin to understand behaviors that are common regardless of the discipline. The application of CS principles, mediated through computer simulation, informs nursing practice of the benefits and drawbacks of new procedures, protocols and practices before having to actually implement them. The inclusion of new computational tools and their applications in nursing education is also gaining attention. For example, education in CSs and applied computational applications has been endorsed by The Institute of Medicine, the American Organization of Nurse Executives and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing as essential training of nurse leaders. The purpose of this article is to review current research literature regarding CS science within the context of expert practice and implications for the education of nurse leadership roles. The article focuses on 3 broad areas: CS defined, literature review and exemplars from CS research and applications of CS theory in nursing leadership education. The article also highlights the key role nursing informaticists play in integrating emerging computational tools in the analysis of complex nursing systems.

AB  - Socio-Ecological Systems (SESs) are the systems in which our everyday lives are embedded, so understanding them is important. The complex properties of such systems make modelling an indispensable tool for their description and analysis. Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.

AB  - Since the very beginning of space exploration, NASA has been building actual size replicas of spaceships and rovers to help them troubleshoot issues when the vehicles are out in outer space. Furthermore, real-time data captured and processed during spaceship launches has helped with timely maneuvering decisions. Similar concepts are currently utilized in various industrial processes such as manufacturing, oil and gas industry, and supply chain to name a few. A good example of the use of Digital twin technology is the GPS-based navigation system where maps are overlaid with location coordinates and real-time traffic data to make decisions on the best available routes. In this chapter we describe the use of digital twin technology in various industries such as manufacturing (including drug and vaccine development), pharmaceutical, healthcare and the practice of medicine. We further describe the rapid development of computation technologies and better structuring of electronic health records which in turn has ushered the emergence of digital health in medicine. Lastly, we provide examples of the use of digital twin technology in the areas of personalized medicine (immunology, dementia, and oncology), biomarker development (Multiple sclerosis, Chron's and Cardiovascular diseases), and clinical trials (Alzheimer's and breast cancer).
