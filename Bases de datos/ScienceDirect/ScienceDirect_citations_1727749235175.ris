AB  - Monitoring of patient’s health in the medical industry can be enabled using wireless body area networks (WBANs), which are already used for various purposes, including assisting in human safety. It is imperative to use better power management strategies since the body sensors are small and the battery cannot hold a charge for a long time. Due to the vast amounts of information generated by medical sensors, resource-constrained networks face a significant challenge when guaranteeing the specified quality of service (QoS). Moreover, the WBAN regularly meets the primary hassle of QoS degradation because of congestion WBAN structure can easily compromise heterogeneous and complex networks. Either inappropriate data collection or using energy effectively to transmit medical data without the expense of travel and length has become an important one. To address this issue, the present research work ‘Link Quality and Energy Efficient Optimal Clustering-Multipath (LEOC-MP)’ scheme tries to explore an answer. The main goals of the LEOC-MP (Optimal Link Quality and Energy Efficient Optimal Clustering-Multipath) system are to guarantee node-to-node link quality, lengthen network life, and compute high-performing cluster heads to guarantee reliable multi path data transfer. This work was executed in three phases. First, an optimal simplified clustering technique for data collection from body sensors using an improved pelican optimization (ICO) algorithm is introduced. Next, multiple design constraints for node rank computation, energy efficiency, link quality, path loss, distance, and delay are used. Besides, an Auto-Regressive Probabilistic Neural Network (AR-PNN) is introduced to optimize those design constraints and compute the cluster head (CH) of each cluster. Multipath firing is then performed using a moderated puffer-fish optimization (MPO) algorithm that finds the closest optimal and shortest node to transmit optimal drug data. The work is simulated using an NS-3 environment, and the results are obtained. The outcome of this work is analyzed with existing methodologies, and the results prove that the present work consistently outperforms the existing methodologies.

AB  - Summary
Important decisions often involve choosing between complex environments that define future item encounters. Despite its importance for adaptive behavior and distinct computational challenges, decision-making research primarily focuses on item choice, ignoring environment choice altogether. Here we contrast previously studied item choice in ventromedial prefrontal cortex with lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl) linked to environment choice. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for how FPl decomposes and represents complex environments during decision making. Specifically, we trained a choice-optimized, brain-naive convolutional neural network (CNN) and compared predicted CNN activation with actual FPl activity. We showed that the high-dimensional FPl activity decomposes environment features to represent the complexity of an environment to make such choice possible. Moreover, FPl functionally connects with posterior cingulate cortex for guiding environment choice. Further probing FPl’s computation revealed a parallel processing mechanism in extracting multiple environment features.

AB  - While research on marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) expands apace, significant unknowns persist regarding the risks and benefits of individual mCDR options. This paper analyses the assumptions and expectations that animate expert understandings of mCDR, with a focus on issues that are central to the responsible governance of this emerging field of climate action. Drawing upon interviews with experts involved in mCDR research projects both academic and entrepreneurial, we highlight four thematic tensions that orient their thinking but are often unstated or left implicit in scientific and technical assessments: (1) the relevance of ‘naturalness’ as a criterion of evaluation for mCDR approaches; (2) the perceived need to accelerate research and development activities via alternative paradigms of evidence-building; (3) a framing of mCDR as a form of waste management that will, in turn, generate new (and currently poorly understood) forms of environmental pollutants; and (4) a commitment to inclusive governance mixed with difficulty in identifying specific stakeholders or constituencies in mCDR interventions. Although expert consensus on these four issues is unlikely, we suggest ways of ensuring that consideration of these themes enriches debate on the responsible development of novel mCDR capabilities.

AB  - The current research proposes that thinking about friends improves feelings about the self and does so differentially depending on avoidance of intimacy. Based on previous findings that individuals who avoid intimacy in relationships (avoidant individuals) contrast their self-concepts with primed friends whereas those who pursue intimacy in relationships (non-avoidant individuals) assimilate their self-concepts to primed friends [Gabriel, S., Carvallo, M., Dean, K., Tippin, B. D., & Renaud, J. (2005). How I see “Me” depends on how I see “We”: The role of avoidance of intimacy in social comparison. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, 156–157], we predicted that friends who embody negative aspects of self would lead avoidant individuals to like themselves more, whereas friends who embody positive aspects of self would lead non-avoidant individuals to like themselves more. A pretest determined that good friends were seen as more similar to positive and ideal aspects of the self, whereas friends about whom participants had more mixed feelings (ambivalent friends) were seen as more similar to disliked and feared aspects of the self. Four experiments supported the main hypotheses. In Experiment 1, non-avoidant individuals like themselves more when good friends were primed. In Experiment 2, avoidant individuals like themselves more when ambivalent friends were primed. In Experiment 3, non-avoidant individuals liked themselves better after thinking about a friend’s positive traits, whereas avoidant individuals liked themselves better after thinking about a friend’s negative traits. In Experiment 4, all individuals under self-esteem threat strategically brought friends to mind who would help them like themselves more.

AB  - Purpose
Music could be a challenger for mathematics and a potential candidate for the title “The Universal Language.” This paper aims to discuss the primary objectives of engaging with music, including the therapeutic benefits. Similarities, between mathematics and music and how studying one might enhance one’s abilities of the other are pointed out.
Design/methodology/approach
A formal definition for a universal language is given. A qualitative approach, supplemented with rigorous reasoning, is adopted. The narrative relies on the author’s experiences, teaching mathematical concepts and musical interactions, with students from several countries. A vast amount of literature is reviewed and the corresponding findings are connected toward the arguments made.
Findings
The paper demonstrates that one day, once we understand both mathematics and music better, we might see both of them as the same language. Until then, it is essential to supplement mathematics with music. The educational implications, for all fields, are to ensure that the future creators of knowledge are equally adept at both music and mathematics. The wider policy connotations are to create a blueprint for a society with a vibrant musical and artistic environment.
Originality/value
This study illuminates new ways of thinking about music and mathematics. The possibility that many seemingly complex entities (including our universe, virtual computer worlds, mathematical operations, etc.), are made up of combinations of much simpler building blocks is hinted at. Familiarity with any intricate element of life, without getting flustered, is bound to produce remarkable results in other such endeavors.

AB  - Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, aided by advances in medical imaging, discoveries in physiology and medicine have added nearly 25 years to the average life expectancy. This resounding success brings with it a need to understand a broad range of age-related health conditions, such as dementia. Today, mathematics, neuroimaging and scientific computing are being combined with fresh insights, from animal models, to study the brain and to better understand the etiology and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of age-related dementia in humans. In this manuscript, we offer a brief primer to the reader interested in engaging with the exciting field of mathematical modeling and scientific computing to advance the study of the brain and, in particular, human AD research. Statement of Significance Modeling Alzheimer’s disease is a highly interdisciplinary field and finding an effective starting point can be a considerable challenge. To address this challenge, this manuscript briefly highlights some central components of AD related protein pathology, useful classes of mathematical models for brain and AD research and effective computational resources for the practical prospective practitioner.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of digitised workflows in diagnostic pathology opens the door to life-saving applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Explainability is identified as a critical component for the safety, approval and acceptance of AI systems for clinical use. Despite the cross-disciplinary challenge of building explainable AI (xAI), very few application- and user-centric studies in this domain have been carried out. We conducted the first mixed-methods study of user interaction with samples of state-of-the-art AI explainability techniques for digital pathology. This study reveals challenging dilemmas faced by developers of xAI solutions for medicine and proposes empirically-backed principles for their safer and more effective design.

AB  - Situational Awareness (SA) assessment is of paramount importance in various domains, with particular significance in the military for safe aviation decision-making. It involves encompassing perception, comprehension, and projection levels in human beings. Accurate evaluation of SA statuses across these three levels is crucial for mitigating human false-positive and false-negative rates in monitoring complex scenarios in the aviation context. This study proposes a comprehensive comparative analysis by involving two types of physiological records: electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) images. These two modalities are leveraged to automate precise SA evaluation using both conventional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques. Benchmarking experiments reveal that the BEAM-based deep learning models attain state-of-the-art performance scores of 0.955 for both SA perception and comprehension levels, respectively. Conversely, the EEG signals-based manual feature extraction, selection, and classification approach achieved a superior accuracy of 0.929 for the projection level of SA. These findings collectively highlight the potential of deploying diverse physiological records as valuable computational tools for enhancing SA evaluation throughout aviation decision-making safety.

AB  - Morality and cooperation are central to human life. Psychological explanations for moral development and cooperative behavior will have biological and evolutionary dimensions, but they can differ radically in their approach to biology. In particular, many recent proposals have pursued the view that aspects of morality are innate. We briefly review and critique two of these claims. In contrast to these nativist assumptions about the role of biology in morality, we present an alternative approach based on a relational developmental systems view of moral development. The role for biology in this approach is in setting up the conditions—the developmental system—in which forms of interaction and later forms of thinking emerge.

AB  - Computational methods recently gained momentum in archaeological science, particularly affecting large site distribution samples and environmental explanatory parameters. However, quantitative and environmental archaeology are still considered to be limited to a small number of experts and thus less ready to use in general research. Here, we present a case study that integrates computational methods and environmental data into archaeological spatial analyses using Point Pattern Analysis (PPA). We introduce a basic approach to model, visualise, and interpret archaeological site distributions as functions of explanatory covariates in a regional setting of the Neolithic period in the Carpathian Basin. The integration of environmental and socio-cultural variables in a multicomponent analysis allows to distinguish site location parameters and preferences across different chronological periods. Using the code to this article and open-access spatial data, the workflow can be adapted to different regional contexts and chronological periods, making it particularly suitable for spatial pattern comparison.

AB  - As part of cognitive intelligence, concept cognition for knowledge graphs aims to clearly grasp the typical characteristics of the things referred to by the concept, which can provide prior knowledge for machine understanding and thinking. Different from concept learning and formal concept analysis that learn new concepts from data and the general decision rule that comes from an independent decision table, this paper cognizes an existing concept by decision rules that come from multiple granularities. Specifically, 1) concept cognition for knowledge graphs is realized from the perspective of mining multi-granularity decision rule. 2) Decision tables corresponding to four granularities form a multi-granularity decision table group, and then the result from coarser granularity can guide and help obtaining the result from finer granularity. 3) We propose a framework for mining multi-granularity decision rules, which involves going from a multi-granularity decision table group to the frequent maximal attribute patterns to the decision rules to the credible decision rules. Finally, we verified effectiveness of dividing positive and negative data, monotonicity of attribute patterns in a multi-granularity decision table group, and downward monotonicity of credibility, and observed the impact of the parameter min_cov and min_conf on execution times.

AB  - Introduction
Chronic pain has multiple aetiological factors and complexity. Pain theory helps us to guide and organize our thinking to deal with this complexity. The objective of this paper is to critically review the most influential theory in pain science history (the gate control theory of pain) and focus on its implications in chronic pain rehabilitation to minimize disability.
Methods
In this narrative review, all the published studies that focused upon pain theory were retrieved from Ovoid Medline (from 1946 till present), EMBAS, AMED and PsycINFO data bases.
Results
Chronic pain is considered a disease or dysfunction of the nervous system. In chronic pain conditions, hypersensitivity is thought to develop from changes to the physiological top-down control (inhibitory) mechanism of pain modulation according to the pain theory. Pain hypersensitivity manifestation is considered as abnormal central inhibitory control at the gate controlling mechanism. On the other hand, pain hypersensitivity is a prognostic factor in pain rehabilitation. It is clinically important to detect and manage hypersensitivity responses and their mechanisms.
Conclusion
Since somatosensory perception and integration are recognized as a contributor to the pain perception under the theory, then we can use the model to direct interventions aimed at pain relief. The pain theory should be leveraged to develop and refine measurement tools with clinical utility for detecting and monitoring hypersensitivity linked to chronic pain mechanisms.

AB  - Decades of psychological research have demonstrated that intuitive judgments are often unreliable, thanks to their inflexible reliance on limited information (Kahneman, 2003, 2011). Research on the computational underpinnings of learning, however, indicates that intuitions may be acquired by sophisticated learning mechanisms that are highly sensitive and integrative. With this in mind, Railton (2014) urges a more optimistic view of moral intuition. Is such optimism warranted? Elsewhere (Greene, 2013) I’ve argued that moral intuitions offer reasonably good advice concerning the give-and-take of everyday social life, addressing the basic problem of cooperation within a “tribe” (“Me vs. Us”), but that moral intuitions offer unreliable advice concerning disagreements between tribes with competing interests and values (“Us vs. Them”). Here I argue that a computational perspective on moral learning underscores these conclusions. The acquisition of good moral intuitions requires both good (representative) data and good (value-aligned) training. In the case of inter-tribal disagreement (public moral controversy), the problem of bad training looms large, as training processes may simply reinforce tribal differences. With respect to moral philosophy and the paradoxical problems it addresses, the problem of bad data looms large, as theorists seek principles that minimize counter-intuitive implications, not only in typical real-world cases, but in unusual, often hypothetical, cases such as some trolley dilemmas. In such cases the prevailing real-world relationships between actions and consequences are severed or reversed, yielding intuitions that give the right answers to the wrong questions. Such intuitions—which we may experience as the voice of duty or virtue—may simply reflect the computational limitations inherent in affective learning. I conclude, in optimistic agreement with Railton, that progress in moral philosophy depends on our having a better understanding of the mechanisms behind our moral intuitions.

AB  - We examine the association between the strength of the Flynn effect in Estonia and highly convergent panel-ratings of the ‘abstractness’ of nine subtests on the National Intelligence Test, in order to test the theory that the Flynn effect results in part from an increase in the use of abstract reference frames in solving cognitive problems. The vectors of abstractness ratings and Flynn effect gains, controlled for guessing) exhibit a near-zero correlation (r=−.02); however, abstractness correlates positively with (and is therefore confounded by) g-loadings (r=.61). A General Linear Model is used to determine the degree to which the abstractness vector predicts the Flynn effect vector, independently of subtest g-loadings and the portion of the secular IQ gain due to guessing (the Brand effect). Consistent with the abstract reasoning model of the Flynn effect, abstractness positively predicts Flynn effect magnitudes, once controlled for confounds (sr=.44), which indicates an increasing tendency to utilize factors external to the items in order to abstract their solutions.

AB  - In this work we propose the following hypothesis: the neuromodulatory mechanisms that control the emotional states of mammals can be translated and re-implemented in a computer by controlling the computational performance of a hosted computational system. In our specific implementation, we represent the simulation of the ‘fear-like’ state based on the three dimensional neuromodulatory model of affects, in this paper ‘affects’ refer to the basic emotional inborn states, inherited from works of Hugo Lövheim. Whilst dopamine controls attention, serotonin is the key for inhibition, and fear is a elicitator for inhibitory and protective processes. This inhibition can promote [in a cognitive system] to blocking behaviour which can be labelled as ’depression’. Therefore, our interest is how to reimplement biomimetically both action-regulators without the computational system to resulting in a ‘failed’ scenario. We have simulated 1000ms of the dopamine system using NEST Neural Simulation Tool with the rat brain as the model. The results of the simulation experiments are reported with an evaluation to demonstrate the correctness of our hypothesis.

AB  - The application of Circular Economy to construction sector is a key to attain carbon neutrality, since it is responsible of 40 % of natural resource consumption. In this frame the importance of an efficient building refurbishment process throughout recycled material and renewable energy is fundamental. From an overview about building refurbishment emerges the need to investigate aspects related to Indoor Environmental Quality and the comparison between in-field measurements with output of dynamic simulation models. The present study aims to fill these two gaps by means an energy renovation of two real buildings in Greece. The work develops within the European project “Drive 0″, born to promote deep environmentally friendly retrofitting by means of circular renovation concepts. The methodological approach involves on-site monitoring of a series of parameters describing the energy, microclimate environmental and air quality, before and after the energy requalification. In addition, a numerical model developed in Building Energy Simulation program is calibrated and a Computational Fluid Dynamics is developed. From the in-field measurements emerges that, on one hand, the refurbishment of heating system shows a great improvement of indoor thermal conditions, with Total Volatile Organic Compounds concentration that sometimes exceed 3.0 mg/m3; on the other hand an integrated thermal insulation reduces infiltrations and changes the envelope behaviour, with a global energy saving of 30 % during winter and autumn periods. Another result of the study shows that a numerical model developed in Building Energy Simulation program and calibrated on energy consumption can greatly fit the local thermal comfort distribution of the occupant zone and predict the indoor air quality, if it outputs are used as input data in a Computational Fluid Dynamics study. These results can be beneficial to decision makers and designers for evaluating emitters positioning, opening design and mechanical ventilation strategies, aimed at reducing energy costs.

AB  - Sustainability is a wicked problem, which is hard to define in a unique way. It cannot be solved and should be treated in a participatory approach involving as many stakeholders in the process as possible. Participatory modeling is an efficient method for dealing with wicked problems. It involves stakeholders in an open-ended process of shared learning and can be essential for developing sustainable technologies. While there may be various levels of participation, the process evolves around a model of the system at stake. The model is built in interaction with the stakeholders; it provides formalism to synchronize stakeholder thinking and knowledge about the system and to move toward consensus about the possible decision making.

Here we describe these building blocks and how they can be assembled to a general purpose computer system, a biological microprocessor. Such a system consists of biological parts building an input / output device, an arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, memory, and wires (busses) to interconnect these components. A biocomputer can be used to monitor and control a biological system.

AB  - In the present work, efforts have been made to create a configuration-based approach to knowledge extraction. The notion of granularity is developed, which allows fine-tuning the expressive possibilities of the semantic network. As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters.

ABSTRACT
At institutions with an emphasis on authentic research experiences as an integral part of the biology curriculum, COVID created a huge challenge for course instructors whose learning objectives were designed for such experiences. Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 min in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.

AB  - In this paper we give an account of the rise and development of coalgebraic thinking in mathematics and computer science as an illustration of the way mathematical frameworks may be transformed. Originating in a foundational dispute as to the correct way to characterise sets, logicians and computer scientists came to see maximizing and minimizing extremal axiomatisations as a dual pair, each necessary to represent entities of interest. In particular, many important infinitely large entities can be characterised in terms of such axiomatisations. We consider reasons for the delay in arriving at the coalgebraic framework, despite many unrecognised manifestations occurring years earlier, and discuss an apparent asymmetry in the relationship between algebra and coalgebra.

AB  - Mental disorders can severely affect quality of life, constitute a major predictive factor of suicide, and are usually underdiagnosed and undertreated. Early detection of signs of mental health problems is particularly important, since unattended, they can be life-threatening. This is why a deep understanding of the complex manifestations of mental disorder development is important. We present a study of mental disorders in social media, from different perspectives. We are interested in understanding whether monitoring language in social media could help with early detection of mental disorders, using computational methods. We developed deep learning models to learn linguistic markers of disorders, at different levels of the language (content, style, emotions), and further try to interpret the behavior of our models for a deeper understanding of mental disorder signs. We complement our prediction models with computational analyses grounded in theories from psychology related to cognitive styles and emotions, in order to understand to what extent it is possible to connect cognitive styles with the communication of emotions over time. The final goal is to distinguish between users diagnosed with a mental disorder and healthy users, in order to assist clinicians in diagnosing patients. We consider three different mental disorders, which we analyze separately and comparatively: depression, anorexia, and self-harm tendencies.

In this work, we describe how the Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST), a toolkit for the construction of cognitive architectures addresses the issue of knowledge representation, by introducing the notion of a computational idea, as being an abstract and generic building block for representing multiple different pieces of knowledge. We particularly address how computational ideas can be used to represent both facts that really happened at an environment and just hypothesis that are not to be considered as being a part of existence, explaining how these are instances of general categories. At the end, we provide different examples to illustrate the subtle differences that are possible to be represented using this knowledge representation scheme.

AB  - The stream of thought can flow freely, without much guidance from attention or cognitive control. What determines what we think about from one moment to the next? Spontaneous thought shares many commonalities with memory processes. We use insights from computational models of memory to explain how the stream of thought flows through the landscape of memory. In this framework of spontaneous thought, semantic memory scaffolds episodic memory to form the content of thought, and drifting context modulated by one's current state – both internal and external – constrains the area of memory to explore. This conceptualization of spontaneous thought can help to answer outstanding questions such as: what is the function of spontaneous thought, and how does the mind select what to think about?

AB  - The horseradish tree “Moringa oleifera” is the most nutritious terrestrial plant around the globe. Although native to India, its fast growth and drought resistance ability enabled the plant to be cultivated worldwide. In the current study, we report on the isolation of a new phenolic methyl ester namely moringinine A (1) along with four other known compounds viz. caffeic acid (2), ferulic acid (3), 4-hydroxybenzonitrile (4), and 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (5) from Moringa seeds. The later compound was first to be isolated from family Moringaceae. Compounds identification was guided by interplay of NMR and HR-ESI-MS analysis. Anti-epileptic studies conducted in vivo showed that the extract attenuates convulsions by suppressing stress–induced pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-ɣ whereas upregulating the anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β and IL-10 in the hippocampal tissues of epileptic rats. The isolated compounds were subjected to computational studies through docking on lactate dehydrogenase A(LDH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), where all showed binding modes and interaction energies comparable to those of the reference drug diazepam. ADME investigation revealed good pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. These results show that Moringa oleifera seeds could potentially be used as adjuvant in the management of epilepsy.

AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) comprise over 3500 global species, primarily in tropical regions, where the females act as disease vectors. Thus, identifying medically significant species is vital. In this context, Wing Geometric Morphometry (WGM) emerges as a precise and accessible method, excelling in species differentiation through mathematical approaches. Computational technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) promise to overcome WGM challenges, supporting mosquito identification. AI explores computers' thinking capacity, originating in the 1950s. Machine Learning (ML) arose in the 1980s as a subfield of AI, and deep Learning (DL) characterizes ML's subcategory, featuring hierarchical data processing layers. DL relies on data volume and layer adjustments. Over the past decade, AI demonstrated potential in mosquito identification. Various studies employed optical sensors, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito identification, achieving average accuracy rates between 84 % and 93 %. Furthermore, larval Aedes identification reached accuracy rates of 92 % to 94 % using CNNs. DL models such as ResNet50 and VGG16 achieved up to 95 % accuracy in mosquito identification. Applying CNNs to georeference mosquito photos showed promising results. AI algorithms automated landmark detection in various insects' wings with repeatability rates exceeding 90 %. Companies have developed wing landmark detection algorithms, marking significant advancements in the field. In this review, we discuss how AI and WGM are being combined to identify mosquito species, offering benefits in monitoring and controlling mosquito populations.

AB  - Interpreting deep learning (DL)-based computer vision models is challenging due to the complexity of internal representations. Most recent techniques for rendering DL learning outcomes interpretable operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. Methods that explicitly incorporate high-level concepts do so through a determination of the relevancy of user-defined concepts or else concepts extracted directly from the data. However, they do not leverage the potential of concepts to explain model predictions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel DL architecture – the Slow/Fast Thinking Network (SoFTNet) – enabling users to define/control high-level features and utilize them to perform image classification predicatively. We draw inspiration from the dual-process theory of human thought processes, decoupling low-level, fast & non-transparent processing from high-level, slow & transparent processing. SoFTNet hence uses a shallow convolutional neural network for low-level processing in conjunction with a memory network for high-level concept-based reasoning. We conduct experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and STL-10 datasets and also present a novel concept-based deep K-nearest neighbor approach for baseline comparisons. Our experiments show that SoFTNet achieves comparable performance to state-of-art non-interpretable models and outperforms comparable interpretative methods.

AB  - Stock trading has a more significant influence on the global economy. Stock trading with portfolio optimization became challenging due to the complexity of analyzing the high variance in time series stock data. Efficient portfolio management increases profit and avoids risky situations when investing. The present work aims to model a Variable Neighborhood Search Multi-Agent System for Portfolio Optimization (VNSMASPPO) to optimize the profit on defined trading constraints on buying, selling, and holding trading decisions. This work proposes a novel Variable Neighborhood Search-based Multi-Agent System (VNASMAS) algorithm for profit computation with a constraint-based multi-agent system. The stock price history experimental data sets are collected from 8th August 2016 to 31st March 2023 with 14,567 records. The proposed model achieved an RMSE of 10.11, MAE of 2.75, and MAPE of 0.017, outperforming the literature models. VNSMASPPO maximizes the portfolio profit and is a reliable, adaptable approach.

In this paper we describe a computer-supported grouping system named DIANA that uses genetic algorithms to achieve fairness, equity, flexibility, and easy implementation. Grouping was performed so as to avoid the creation of exceptionally weak groups. We tested DIANA with 66 undergraduate computer science students assigned to groups of three either randomly (10 groups) or using an algorithm reflecting [Sternberg, R. J. (1994). Thinking styles: theory and assessment at the interface between intelligence and personality. In R. J. Sterberg, & P. Ruzgis (Eds.), Personality and Intelligence (pp. 169–187). New York: Cambridge University Press.] three thinking styles (12 groups). The results indicate that: (a) the algorithm-determined groups were more capable of completing whatever they were “required to do” at a statistically significant level, (b) both groups were equally capable of solving approximately 80% of what they “chose to do,” and (c) the algorithm-determined groups had smaller inter-group variation in performance. Levels of satisfaction with fellow group member attitudes, the cooperative process, and group outcomes were also higher among members of the algorithm-determined groups. Suggestions for applying computer-supported group composition systems are offered.

AB  - Traditionally, in the West, the decision about which flavours to pair in a tasting experience has been as much the personal choice of the chef or, more likely, the sommelier, as anything else. However, the last couple of decades have seen a rapid growth of research interest in the pairing of flavours. Nowadays, one can find examples of people pairing everything from beer with food, tea with cheese and chocolate, etc. As interest in the marketing potential of flavour pairing has risen, along with the growing public fascination in the topic, scientists have become increasingly interested in trying to understand the principles (both cognitive/intellectual and perceptual) underlying the successful pairing of flavours. In this narrative review, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the chemical, computational (gastronomy), and perceptual approaches to pairing flavours are highlighted. Thereafter, I show how the various principles of pairing (both perceptual and cognitive/intellectual) can be extended beyond the domain of pairing flavour with flavour to consider the rapidly growing are of sonic seasoning. The latter term refers to those situations in which specific pieces of music or soundscapes are matched, or paired, with particular tastes/flavours based on the crossmodal correspondences. The review ends by considering the future development of pairings flavours, and assessing novel means of establishing connections between flavours and other sensations.

AB  - Neuroimaging has offered an unprecedented window on human brain activity. While this advance has led to great expectations, many neuroscientists have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of causal insights that this technique has provided into human brain function, in turn, leading to heated discussions on the potential rise of neophrenology. Elsewhere in this book, you can read about the apparent failure of brain imaging to tell us much new or meaningful about thinking and cognition in general. Such views are true to a certain extent; brain imaging often takes indirect measures of neural activity such as blood flow and, just because such brain measures correlate with behavioral output, does not mean that they cause the output. But, these new tools do measure important information about brain activity that could potentially tell us a great deal about brain and mind.

AB  - What makes objects alike in the human mind? Computational approaches for characterizing object similarity have largely focused on the visual forms of objects or their linguistic associations. However, intuitive notions of object similarity may depend heavily on contextual reasoning—that is, objects may be grouped together in the mind if they occur in the context of similar scenes or events. Using large-scale analyses of natural scene statistics and human behavior, we found that a computational model of the associations between objects and their scene contexts is strongly predictive of how humans spontaneously group objects by similarity. Specifically, we learned contextual prototypes for a diverse set of object categories by taking the average response of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to the scene contexts in which the objects typically occurred. In behavioral experiments, we found that contextual prototypes were strongly predictive of human similarity judgments for a large set of objects and rivaled the performance of models based on CNN representations of the objects themselves or word embeddings for their names. Together, our findings reveal the remarkable degree to which the natural statistics of context predict commonsense notions of object similarity.

AB  - Contemporary societal challenges put in evidence the need to improve the hard and soft skills of chemical engineering students. To promote a more student-centered approach, active-based learning, and improved assessment strategies, the Brazilian government approved the so-called New National Curriculum Guidelines (NCG) for engineering courses. To comply with those guidelines, the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (USP) is currently developing an educational modernization process sponsored by the Fulbright Commission in Brazil, called Special Program for Modernization of Undergraduate Education (PMG). The project is based on three pillars of modernization: content (what), form (how), and infrastructure (where). This paper describes initiatives in each of those pillars: content and format changes in Chemical Reaction Engineering and Process Safety courses and the creation of new spaces for a student-centered approach (an innovative classroom layout and a makerspace). By gathering two concrete classroom experiences guided by a broader institutional educational policies (the PMG project and the NCG), this paper highlights that slight changes can lead to great improvements in the learning process, leading to more engagement in the development of hard skills while favoring improvements in soft skills, such as communication, team-based work, and critical thinking.

AB  - Construction industry is the largest global consumer of materials. This huge share comes with the huge responsibility to account for economic, environmental, and social impacts associated with the materials through adoption of sustainable procurement strategies. Sustainable material procurement requires reconciliation among economic, environmental and social impacts of procurement decisions throughout the life cycle of materials. However, this is challenging mainly due to the broad range of economic, environmental and social impacts associated with different stages of material’s life cycle as well as the overlapping impacts that various supply decisions may have on multiple performance areas. Current practices of material procurement are, on the other hand, predominantly influenced by economy of construction stage and little attention is paid to environmental and social considerations over a long-term horizon. Moreover, material supply decisions made currently in practice are commonly traditional and tend to largely overlook the opportunities made available by advances in material science, computing, and decision-making areas. This chapter starts by presenting an overview of sustainability challenges associated with current material procurement practices to highlight the need for adoption of new sustainable approaches and technologies. It then continues by highlighting the challenges associated with adoption of new approaches and the important sustainability criteria to be considered in selection of new sustainable materials, technologies, and procurement strategies. A comprehensive decision-making framework for identifying the most sustainable procurement options in a construction project among various procurement options available is then presented. The framework is founded on the concepts of life cycle thinking and supply chain structure which are incorporated in to a computational module to compare the life cycle impacts of various supply decision based on the selection criteria determined collaboratively by different project stakeholders. The results of such comparative analysis leads to a ranking of various procurement decision alternatives comprised of different combinations of supply decision including material type, material supply structure, location of supplier, and mode of transport.

KW  - Robot creativity
AB  - Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) are increasingly used in dementia and elderly care. In order to provide effective assistance, SARs need to be personalized to individual patients and account for stimulating their divergent thinking in creative ways. Rule-based fuzzy logic systems provide effective methods for automated decision-making of SARs. However, expanding and modifying the rules of fuzzy logic systems to account for the evolving needs, preferences, and medical conditions of patients can be tedious and costly. In this paper, we introduce EFS4SAR, a novel Evolving Fuzzy logic System for Socially Assistive Robots that supports autonomous evolution of the fuzzy rules that steer the behavior of the SAR. EFS4SAR combines traditional rule-based fuzzy logic systems with evolutionary algorithms, which model the process of evolution in nature and have shown to result in creative behaviors. We evaluate EFS4SAR via computer simulations on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that the fuzzy rules evolved over time are not only personalized with respect to the personal preferences and therapeutic needs of the patients, but they also meet the following criteria for creativity of SARs: originality and effectiveness of the therapeutic tasks proposed to the patients. Compared to existing evolving fuzzy systems, EFS4SAR achieves similar effectiveness with higher degree of originality.

ABSTRACT
At institutions with an emphasis on authentic research experiences as an integral part of the biology curriculum, COVID created a huge challenge for course instructors whose learning objectives were designed for such experiences. Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 min in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.

AB  - Visual and thermal comfort for occupants significantly depend on exterior environmental climatic conditions, which are continuously changing. In particular, optimizing visual and thermal comfort simultaneously is a difficult topic due to mutual conflicts between them. This literature review article studies the façade, as a complex interface between inside of buildings and the outside that has a capability to function as a protective or regulatory element against severe fluctuations of external climate. Six interrelated subjects are studied including kinetic façade, biomimicry, building form as a microclimate modifier, energy efficiency, comfort condition, parametric design thinking. The literature review process answers following research questions: (1) what are the interdisciplinary subjects corresponding to kinetic façade design process for creating an innovative architectural process? (2) What is the most important factor in kinetic façade design with the aim to improve occupants’ visual and thermal comfort simultaneously based on multidisciplinary investigation? Many research has been carried out about kinetic façade concepts strategies, principles, and criteria. However, interdisciplinary studies for proposing kinetic façade form is relatively rare. Also, adaptive daylight façade with daily solar geometry variation has been highly required. Therefore, generative-parametric and quick form finding method for responding to different climates would be a solution for providing more adaptability to dynamic daylight. This study aims to propose a kinetic façade design process which have capability to improve occupant visual & thermal comfort simultaneously by controlling on-site renewable energy resources consist of solar radiation and wind. Façade as an only interface between inside and outside of building, far from the literal and historical perceptions, is recognized by intrinsic functional attributes including complexity, heterogeneity and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the interrelated subjects impact façade form individually and aggregately regard to functional scenario that is changed the perception of kinetic façade from elegant and fashionable state to a functional and practical element.

AB  - This research work intends to study the effect of hybridization of glass and sisal fiber, stacking sequence and tensile properties of the composite. The sisal-glass fiber hybrid composites laminates are prepared using reinforced plain woven sisal fabric (unidirectional) and plainwoven glass fabric. In this research study, 27 experiments are conducted as per L27 orthogonal array. Five process parameters are selected and three responses are considered in this work. The drilling of the composite specimen is considered and the drilling process parameters such as speed, feed rate, drill diameter, material thickness, and drill point angle are selected. The responses considered in this work are delamination factor, thrust force, and torque. Taguchi analysis is performed and the response table for means for the responses is determined, and the most influencing parameter in the drilling of the composite specimen is analyzed. The grey relational coefficients are computed and followed with the computation of the grey relational grade. The grey relational grades are calculated for determining the highest contributing parameter in the drilling of the sisal fiber and glass fiber reinforced hybrid composite specimen. The optimum drilling process parameters are ranked and the ranks presented represent the sequence of run resulting in optimum solutions.

AB  - In this article, we introduce a framework for interpreting Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) through predictive processing, a neuroscience concept explaining the brain’s interpretation and prediction of sensory information. While closely related to PTSD, C-PTSD encompasses additional symptom clusters marked by disturbances in self-organization (DSO), such as negative self-concept, affect dysregulation, and relational difficulties, typically resulting from prolonged traumatic stressors. Our model leverages advances in computational psychiatry and neuroscience, offering a mechanistic explanation for these symptoms by illustrating how prolonged trauma disrupts the brain's predictive processing. Specifically, altered predictive mechanisms contribute to C-PTSD's symptomatology, focusing on DSO: (1) Negative self-concept emerges from maladaptive priors that bias perception towards self-criticism, misaligning expected and actual interoceptive states; (2) Misalignment between predicted and actual interoceptive signals leads to affect dysregulation, with sensitivity to bodily cues; and (3) Relationship challenges arise from skewed social prediction errors, fostering mistrust and withdrawal. This precision-focused approach sheds light on the dynamics underpinning C-PTSD and highlights potential intervention targets aimed at recalibrating the predictive processing system.

AB  - The widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in language education contexts has motivated several scholars around the world to uncover the advantages and disadvantages of AI and AI-powered instruments in different language classrooms. Yet, as the review of earlier investigations revealed, few inquiries have been carried out to divulge the pros and cons of leveraging AI in EFL classes. To narrow this gap, using the phenomenological approach, this inquiry investigated the opportunities and challenges of implementing AI in EFL classes from the perspective of Chinese EFL students. To do so, through the criterion sampling technique, a total of 45 EFL students was recruited from different educational institutions in China. To collect the dataset, participants were asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire. For the sake of triangulation, among the 45 participants, 15 were randomly selected to engage in a follow-up interview session. With the aid of MAXQDA software (version 2023), participants’ perceptions of AI opportunities and challenges were carefully analyzed. Overall, the analysis findings uncovered that leveraging AI in EFL classes can bring numerous opportunities for EFL students, including individualized learning, timely and immediate feedback, rich educational resources, and an interactive learning atmosphere. However, as demonstrated by the analysis outcomes, implementing AI in EFL courses may also face students with a range of challenges and problems. The research outcomes would be of great help to teachers and educational leaders in mitigating the challenges of leveraging AI in language classrooms.

AB  - The Gaia hypothesis in a strong and frequently criticized form assumes that global homeostatic mechanisms have evolved by natural selection favoring the maintenance of conditions suitable for life. Traditional neoDarwinists hold this to be impossible in theory. But the hypothesis does make sense if one treats the clade that comprises the biological component of Gaia as an individual and allows differential persistence – as well as differential reproduction – to be an outcome of evolution by natural selection. Recent developments in theoretical and experimental evolutionary biology may justify both maneuvers.

AB  - In a complex financial system, what is the forecasting performance of macro and micro evolution models of Econophysics on asset prices? For this problem, from the perspective of machine learning, we study the dynamic forecasting and liquidity assessment of financial markets, based on econophysics and Bayesian methods. We establish eight dynamic prediction methods, based on our proposed likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation methods of macro and micro evolution models of econophysics. Combined machine learning thinking and real data, we empirically study and simulate the out-of-sample dynamic forecasting analysis of eight proposed methods and compare with the benchmark GARCH model. A variety of loss functions, superior predictive ability test (SPA), Akaike and Bayesian information criterion (AIC and BIC) methods are introduced to further evaluate the forecasting performance of our proposed methods. The research of out of sample prediction shows that (1) the method of the simplified stochastic model with Bayesian method for only sample return has the best forecasting performance; (2) the method of the stochastic model with Bayesian method for only return samples has the worst forecasting performance. For the liquidity assessment problem, there is a strong correlation between the trading probability evaluated by the proposed eight methods and the real turnover rate, and an increase of liquidity is correspond to the increase of asset risk. In other words, it suggests that all proposed methods can well evaluate market liquidity.

AB  - 2012 and 2013 have been challenging years for Computer Science (CS) education in the UK. After decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce CS into the 11-16 age school curriculums. Immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no CS background and an estimated need for 20,000 new CS teachers - existing UK IT teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. The Computing at School (CAS) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an IT to Computing syllabus, as have the British Computer Society (BCS), leading UK universities and a number of major international technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, British Telecom and Facebook.This paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. It describes, in particular, the work of the BCS-funded Glyndwr University ‘Turing Project’ in introducing Welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and ‘computational thinking’. The Turing Project uses an innovative combination of Lego NXT Mindstorm robots, Raspberry Pi computers and PicoBoard hardware together with the Robot C and Scratch programming platforms. The paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme. Lessons learnt and future directions are considered in conclusion.

AB  - What can architects learn from AlphaGo? This chapter explores the lessons to be learnt from the famous match where AlphaGo, a machine-learning system developed by DeepMind, beat leading Korean Go player, Lee Sedol. It explores the ramifications of this victory on a series of different levels, from the global impact of the match on research into AI to the impact on Xkool Technologies and Spacemaker AI, two architectural start-ups developing AI systems for architecture and urban planning. It makes a particular comparison between the operations of AlphaGo and the strategic thinking of urban planning, arguing that AI now puts the future of urban planners—and possibly also architects—at risk. It then goes on to appraise the famous Move 37 made by AlphaGo in Game 2 of this match. It argues that, despite appearances, this move was not actually creative. Finally, it explores how we might view human creativity in the light of comments made about AlphaGo. The chapter concludes by speculating whether the ultimate lesson of AlphaGo is that creativity is simply a question of “perceived creativity.”

AB  - With the development of society and the advancement of technology, intelligent robots have been widely used in various fields. At the same time, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology is a key technology in the research field of intelligent robots. However, in dynamic environments, achieving accurate and robust visual SLAM remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a method based on improved YOLOv8 fused with ORB-SLAM3 to address dense point cloud SLAM in dynamic environments. Our proposed method successfully integrates real-time object detection and image segmentation technologies of YOLOv8 into the ORB-SLAM3 framework, achieving high-precision and robust visual SLAM in dynamic environments. In the YOLOv8 framework, we use a balanced convolution method, GSConv, instead of some traditional convolution layers (Conv), which balances accuracy with computational load. Based on the GSConv convolution method, we adopt a new feature fusion module, VoVGSCSP, to replace traditional C2f feature fusion modules, thereby improving the Neck structure of YOLOv8 and achieving a lightweight network model. We compare our proposed method with ORB-SLAM3 and some computer vision algorithms on the TUM dataset. Experimental data confirms that our method outperforms existing visual SLAM algorithms in dynamic environments. In fast-moving dynamic environments, the RMSE of absolute pose estimation of our method is 96.28% lower than that of ORB-SLAM3, and the RMSE of relative pose estimation is 51.57% lower than that of ORB-SLAM3. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of pose estimation in dynamic environments and greatly enhances the performance compared to ORB-SLAM3.

AB  - The paper describes and discusses processes needed for human emotional behaviour simulation, in particular, emotion incorporation into rational thinking, as well as presents corresponding agent architecture. Such system would enable various application fields, perhaps one of the most important being enhancing smart devices with emotions. Decreasing frequency of social contact has become an urgent issue, particularly among young people. Emotional and social intelligence are however highly desired set of skills which is impossible to develop without interacting with others. Although this problem has been acknowledged, and there are some efforts to facilitate social contact, e.g., by augmented virtual reality games, that is still not enough. There is a need to develop environment that would allow learning exactly social and emotional skills. This on-going research aims at developing intelligent agents that are able to express and incorporate affects into rational processes.

AB  - While recent years have witnessed increasing theoretical and empirical elaboration on the construct of teacher feedback literacy in higher education and second language education, little research has investigated the development of teacher feedback literacy, especially when teachers collaborate in an attempt to improve feedback strategies with technology. To fill this gap, the present study examined two L2 writing teachers taking the initiative to create, update, and implement a human-computer-automatic writing evaluation (AWE) integral feedback platform, and how such a feedback innovation process impacted their feedback literacy development. The analysis of multiple sources of data, including semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, class observation, and artifacts, revealed that the two teachers approached the innovation by orchestrating mediating tools, interacting dialogically with social agents, reflecting critically, and crossing boundaries. Through this process, the development of teacher feedback literacy occurred at varying rates across different aspects. Specifically, positive changes were effected in the teachers’ feedback thinking as well as feedback giving and sharing practices. However, the teachers’ feedback literacy in classroom practice did not seem to have generated as salient a positive outcome. Possible reasons are discussed regarding the scope of the feedback innovation and contextual constraints, and implications are offered. The study underscored L2 writing teacher feedback literacy as a developmental phenomenon molded by situated social practice.

AB  - Efficient land use planning and scheduling in Food-Energy-Water Nexus (FEW-N) related systems is a complicated decision-making problem with resource competitions and conflicting objectives. Systematic thinking based on FEW-N is a necessity for modeling and optimization of the systems. However, challenges arise in making decisions while encountering conflicting objectives, multi-scale and multi-period problems, and multiple stakeholders. To address these challenges, we developed a generic optimization-based land allocation approach, which provides i) a composite FEW-N metric to help solve the multi-objective optimization problem and carry out assessments, and ii) a two-stage decomposition strategy to solve the multi-scale and multi-period planning and scheduling problem. The developed strategy was applied in a case study within the Texas Edwards Region. Computational results indicate that the approach can provide a comprehensive FEW-N metric to select strategies for optimal land allocation and limit stresses in the FEW-N, and achieve trade-off solutions for the multi-scale and multi-period FEW land use systems.

AB  - We review recent theoretical and empirical work on the emergence of relational reasoning, drawing connections among the fields of comparative psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning. Relational learning appears to involve multiple systems: a suite of Early Systems that are available to human infants and are shared to some extent with nonhuman animals; and a Late System that emerges in humans only, at approximately age three years. The Late System supports reasoning with explicit role-governed relations, and is closely tied to the functions of a frontoparietal network in the human brain. Recent work in cognitive science and machine learning suggests that humans (and perhaps machines) may acquire abstract relations from nonrelational inputs by means of processes that enable re-representation.

AB  - Throughout history, symmetry has been widely explored as a geometric strategy to conceive architectural forms and spaces. Nonetheless, its concept has changed and expanded overtime. Nowadays, it is understood as an ordering principle resulting from the application of isometric transformations that keep the original object invariant. Departing from this notion, scientists, philosophers and designers have extended it to embrace other geometric scenarios. Following this idea, exploring symmetry does not mean the generation of simple and predictable design solutions. On the contrary, it is a creative window to achieve geometric complexity based on very simple rules. In this context, this paper aims at discussing the relevance of exploring symmetry in architectural design today by means of digital technologies. It argues that the coupled use of computational design and digital fabrication processes allows designers to explore and materialize a higher level of design complexity in a structured and controlled way, especially when non-isometric transformations are involved. As the background for testing and illustrating its arguments, this paper describes a teaching experiment conducted in the Constructive Geometry course at the FAUP, following design-to-fabrication methodologies.

AB  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a member of the swarm computational family and widely used for solving nonlinear optimization problems. But, it tends to suffer from premature stagnation, trapped in the local minimum and loses exploration capability as the iteration progresses. On the contrary, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is proficient for searching global optimum, however, its drawback is its slow searching speed in the final phase. To overcome these problems in this paper a novel Hybrid Gravitational Search Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (HGSPSO) is presented. The key concept behind the proposed method is to merge the local search ability of GSA with the capability for social thinking (gbest) of PSO. To examine the effectiveness of these methods in solving the abovementioned issues of slow convergence rate and trapping in local minima five standard and some modern CEC benchmark functions are used to ensure the efficacy of the presented method. Additionally, a DNA sequence problem is also solved to confirm the proficiency of the proposed method. Different parameters such as Hairpin, Continuity, H-measure, and Similarity are employed as objective functions. A hierarchal approach was used to solve this multi-objective problem where a single objective function is first obtained through a weighted sum method and the results were then empirically validated. The proposed algorithm has demonstrated an extraordinary performance per solution stability and convergence.

AB  - Non-prehensile cooperative object transportation is a challenging model problem for distributed control and organization methods but also has practical applications. Therefore, it is widely studied in distributed robotics research. This paper describes and evaluates a novel transportation scheme for differential-drive mobile robots that is, to the authors’ best knowledge, the most versatile scheme of its kind successfully evaluated with real-world hardware. The proposed scheme can conceptually deal with any number of robots and arbitrary polygonal objects, including non-convex ones, without having to retune, retrain, or reconfigure any of the control parameters between different scenarios. This is achieved by splitting the task into a formation control and a formation finding task, both of which are tackled with model-based approaches using distributed optimization. Formation control and formation finding are complicated by the robots’ non-holonomic kinematic constraints. Therefore, a tailored distributed model predictive controller is used for formation control. Finding formations relies on a multibody-dynamics representation of the robots-object system to properly account for contact and non-holonomic constraints. Due to these measures, the transportation scheme achieves a very satisfactory performance and dexterity in real-world hardware experiments utilizing network communication and distributed computation.

AB  - Digital systems offer computational power and instant feedback. Game designers are using these features to create scaffolding tools to reduce player frustration. However, researchers are finding some unexpected effects of scaffolding on strategy development and problem-solving behaviors. We used a digital Sudoku game named Professor Sudoku to classify built-in critical features, frustration control and demonstration scaffolds, and to investigate their effects on player/learner behaviors. Our data indicate that scaffolding support increased the level at which puzzles could be solved, and decreased frustration resulting from excessive numbers of retries. However, it also reduced the number of unassisted placements (i.e., independently filled cells), and increased reliance on scaffolding tools, both of which are considered disadvantageous for learning. Among the three scaffold types, frustration control reduced the potential for players to feel stuck at certain levels, but also reduced the frequency of use of critical feature-making tools, which are thought to have greater heuristic value. We conclude that the simultaneous provision of critical feature and frustration control scaffolds may increase player reliance on available support, thereby reducing learning opportunities. Providing players with critical features and demonstration scaffolds at the same time increases reliance on available support for some players, but for most it encourages the development of solving strategies.

Structural neuroimaging studies have identified a combination of shared and disorder-specific patterns of gray matter (GM) deficits across psychiatric disorders. Pooling large data allows for examination of a possible common neuroanatomical basis that may identify a certain vulnerability for mental illness. Large-scale collaborative research is already facilitated by data repositories, institutionally supported databases, and data archives. However, these data-sharing methodologies can suffer from significant barriers. Federated approaches augment these approaches by enabling access or more sophisticated, shareable and scaled-up analyses of large-scale data. We examined GM alterations using Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation, an open-source, decentralized analysis application. Through federated analysis of eight sites, we identified significant overlap in the GM patterns (n = 4,102) of individuals with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. These results show cortical and subcortical regions that may indicate a shared vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Despite the widespread proliferation of social media in policy and politics, televised election debates are still a prominent form of large-scale public engagement between politicians and the electorate during election campaigns. Advanced visual interfaces can improve these important spaces of democratic engagement. In this paper, we present a user study in which a new hypervideo technology was compared with a publicly available interface for television replay. The results show that hypervideo navigation, coupled with interactive visualisations, improved sensemaking of televised political debates and promoted people's attitude to challenging personal assumptions. This finding suggests that hypervideo interfaces can play a substantial role in supporting citizens in the complex sensemaking process of informing their political choices during an election campaign, and can be used as instruments to promote critical thinking and political opinion shifting.

AB  - Catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily symptoms have a central role in cognitive-behavioural models of health anxiety. However, the metacognitive (S-REF) model postulates that psychological disturbance is linked more to beliefs about thinking i.e., metacognition. Equally the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety should be moderated by metacognition, in particular negative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thinking (MCQNeg). Participants (N=351) completed measures to examine the relationship between these variables. Results indicated positive relationships between metacognition, catastrophic misinterpretation, and health anxiety. Moderation analysis showed that the effect of catastrophic misinterpretations on health anxiety was explained by the proposed interaction with metacognition. Follow-up regression analysis demonstrated the interaction term explained variance in health anxiety when controlling for other variables, and was a stronger unique predictor of health anxiety than catastrophic misinterpretation. Metacognition appears to be an important factor in the relationship between catastrophic misinterpretation and health anxiety, and would have important implications for existing models and treatment.

AB  - Thinking, intelligence, data integration, and attention are aspects of consciousness for which tests have been designed. A short history of the Computer Science field, a description, and an assessment of results obtained to this point for the Turing Test and Chinese Room Test are part of this chapter. Alternative definitions of artificial intelligence are presented. Applied tests for consciousness including those for intelligence, attention, intentionality, volition, and self-awareness are discussed as applied to the assessment of machine systems. Strong AI and the concept of autonomous entities are defined and addressed. The presence of dream-equivalent states is discussed as a potential marker for human-equivalent consciousness.

AB  - The Death/Suicide Implicit Association Test (d/s-IAT) has differentiated individuals with prior and prospective suicide attempts in previous studies, however, age effects on test results remains to be explored. A three-site study compared performance on the d/s-IAT among participants aged 16–80 years with depression and prior suicide attempt (n = 82), with depression and no attempts (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 86). Outcome measures included the standard difference (D) score, median reaction times, and error rates. Higher D scores represent a stronger association between death/suicide and self, while lower scores represent a stronger association between life and self. The D scores differed significantly among groups overall. Participants with depression exhibited higher scores compared to healthy controls, but there was no difference between participants with and without prior suicide attempts(F[2,242]=8.76, p<.001). Response times for participants with prior attempts differed significantly from other groups, with no significant differences in error rates. The D score was significantly affected by age (β =-0.007, t = 3.65, p<.001), with slowing of response times in older ages. Results suggest reaction time d/s-IAT D scores may not distinguish implicit thinking about suicide as response times slow with age, but slowed response times may be sensitive to suicide risk potentially indicating basic information processing deficits.

AB  - Active Noise Control (ANC) systems play a crucial role in reducing unwanted noise in various settings. Traditional ANC methods, like the Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FxLMS) algorithm, are effective in linear noise scenarios. However, they often struggle with more nonlinear and complex noise patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach using the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm in nonlinear ANC systems, which represents a significant departure from conventional techniques. The BSO algorithm, inspired by human brainstorming processes, excels in addressing the complexities of nonlinear noise by incorporating principles, such as delayed evaluation, free imagination, quantity and quality, and comprehensive improvement. By combining the BSO algorithm with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a new ANC system is proposed that can adapt to a wide range of noise types with improved speed and accuracy. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of the BSO algorithm, achieving an impressive noise reduction of up to 48 dB (dB) in a 500Hz sinusoidal noise scenario, with a convergence time as fast as 0.01 s, outperforming the FxLMS algorithm by a significant margin. Moreover, in complex environments with multi-frequency and random noise, the BSO algorithm consistently demonstrates better noise reduction and quicker convergence, reducing noise levels by up to 27 dB within 0.001 s. The innovative use of the BSO algorithm in ANC systems not only enhances noise reduction capabilities, especially for nonlinear and complex noise signals, but also improves convergence times, paving the way for future advancements in ANC technologies.

AB  - Multiparty interactions are common place in today's distributed systems. An agent usually communicates, in a single session, with other agents to accomplish a given task. Take for instance an online transaction including the vendor, the client, the credit card system and the bank. When specifying this kind of system, we probably observe a single transaction including several (binary) communications leading to changes in the state of all the involved agents. Multiway synchronization process calculi, that move from a binary to a multiparty synchronization discipline, have been proposed to formally study the behavior of those systems. However, adopting models such as Bodei, Brodo, and Bruni's Core Network Algebra (CNA), where the number of participants in an interaction is not fixed a priori, leads to an exponential blow-up in the number of states/behaviors that can be observed from the system. In this paper we explore mechanisms to tackle this problem. We extend CNA with constraints that declaratively allow the modeler to restrict the interaction that should actually happen. Our extended process algebra, called CCNA, finds application in balancing the interactions in a concurrent system, leading to a simple, deadlock-free and fair solution for the Dinning Philosopher problem. Our definition of constraints is general enough and it offers the possibility of accumulating costs in a multiparty negotiation. Hence, only computations respecting the thresholds imposed by the modeler are observed. We use this machinery to neatly model a Service Level Agreement protocol. We develop the theory of CCNA including its operational semantics and a behavioral equivalence that we prove to be a congruence. We also propose a prototypical implementation that allows us to verify, automatically, some of the systems explored in the paper.

KW  - Three-way clustering
AB  - Clustering, as an unsupervised data mining technique, allows us to classify similar objects into the same cluster according to certain criteria. It helps us identify patterns between objects, reveal the associations between objects, and discover hidden structures. Traditional two-way clustering (2W clustering) algorithms represent one cluster by one set and only two types of relationships are considered between a sample and a cluster, namely, belonging to and not belonging to. Two-way decision is not always feasible especially in situations that are characterized by uncertainty and lack of information. Guided by the principle of three-way decision (3WD) as thinking in threes, three-way clustering (3W clustering) addresses the information uncertainty problem using core and the fringe regions to character a cluster. The universe is split into three sections by these two sets, which capture three kinds of relationships between objects and a cluster, namely, belonging to, partially belonging to, and not belonging-to. Compared with 2W clustering methods, 3W clustering incorporates the fringe region to describe the uncertain relationship between objects and clusters, which provides more information about the clustering structure. This survey points out the historical developments of three-way clustering and makes an overview of the achievements in the field of three-way clustering. In addition, to reap a clearer grasp of the development and research significance of three-way clustering, we divide the existing three-way clustering approaches into two categories and present the bibliometric analysis of related approaches. Finally, we point out some challenges and future research topics in three-way clustering. It is hoped that this review can serve as a reference and provide convenience for scholars and practitioners in the field of three-way clustering.

AB  - The paper considers the possibility of constructing a specialized computing system oriented at the transmission of data through information channels, that are determined taking into account the semantics of the selected data. In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language. The supporting system is implemented in an applicative programming environment. Some elements of the supporting system were tested when developing applied information systems in the field of jurisprudence.

AB  - Counting of mitotic figures is a fundamental step in grading and prognostication of several cancers. However, manual mitosis counting is tedious and time-consuming. In addition, variation in the appearance of mitotic figures causes a high degree of discordance among pathologists. With advances in deep learning models, several automatic mitosis detection algorithms have been proposed but they are sensitive to domain shift often seen in histology images. We propose a robust and efficient two-stage mitosis detection framework, which comprises mitosis candidate segmentation (Detecting Fast) and candidate refinement (Detecting Slow) stages. The proposed candidate segmentation model, termed EUNet, is fast and accurate due to its architectural design. EUNet can precisely segment candidates at a lower resolution to considerably speed up candidate detection. Candidates are then refined using a deeper classifier network, EfficientNet-B7, in the second stage. We make sure both stages are robust against domain shift by incorporating domain generalization methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and generalizability of the proposed model on the three largest publicly available mitosis datasets, winning the two mitosis domain generalization challenge contests (MIDOG21 and MIDOG22). Finally, we showcase the utility of the proposed algorithm by processing the TCGA breast cancer cohort (1,124 whole-slide images) to generate and release a repository of more than 620K potential mitotic figures (not exhaustively validated).

AB  - The article has a double purpose. On the one hand, it contributes to theories of cultural legitimacy and classification. Based on data about consumers’ music evaluations, it shows that taste hierarchies are configured as nested and relational classificatory systems. Nested, because rank systems of symbolic value are collectively recognized, reproduced, and negotiated by consumers not only at the level of genres, but also at lower, nested levels – e.g., sub-genre, artist, single artwork; relational, because the value attributed to music by consumers is ordinarily assessed and constructed through analogies and comparisons, and partly depends on the classifier's relative position in the social space. On the other hand, this paper makes a key methodological contribution: by analyzing large amounts of YouTube data through computational methods and in combination with survey data, it illustrates how the granularity of digital traces can advance sociological research on cultural categories, meaning structures and symbolic imaginaries.

AB  - Operator performance measures are used for multiple purposes, such as control room design, human system interface (HSI) evaluation, training, and so on. Performance measures are often focused on results; however, especially for a training purpose – at least in a nuclear industry, more detailed descriptions about processes are required. Situation awareness (SA) measurements have directly/indirectly played as a complimentary measure and provided descriptive insights on how to improve performance of operators for the next training. Unfortunately, most of the well-developed SA measurement techniques, such as Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) need an expert opinion which sometimes troubles easy spread of measurement’s application or usage. A quantitative SA measurement tool named Computational Representation of Situation Awareness with Graphical Expressions (CoRSAGE) is introduced to resolve some of these concerns. CoRSAGE is based on production rules to represent a human operator’s cognitive process of problem solving, and Bayesian inference to quantify it. Petri Net concept is also used for graphical expressions of SA flow. Three components – inference transition, volatile/non-volatile memory tokens – were newly developed to achieve required functions. Training data of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) scenario for an emergency condition and an earthquake scenario for an abnormal condition by real plant operators were used to validate the tool. The validation result showed that CoRSAGE performed a reasonable match to other performance results.

In the current study, an online questionnaire is used, adopting the verbal subtests of Wallach–Kogan Creativity Tests and the McCrae and Costa Big Five Personality Inventory. It is found that TRPG players score higher in divergent thinking tests. Priming and instruction giving methods lower the performance of all participants, in particular, when the instruction is memory provoking. ERPG players score lowest among the three groups. TRPG could be regarded as a form of improvisation. It could also be a preferable activity for the promotion of creativity. It is low cost and no formal setting is required to play. Many ERPGs are originated from TRPGs, therefore, with the popularity of ERPG, there should be advantages in promoting TRPG.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of ontology generation. Ontology plays an important role in knowledge representation, and it is an artifact describing a certain reality with specific vocabulary. Recently many researchers have realized that folksonomy is a potential knowledge source for generating ontologies. Although some results have already been reported on generating ontologies from folksonomies, most of them do not consider what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, nor do they take human thinking into consideration. Cognitive psychologists find that most human knowledge is represented by basic level concepts which is a family of concepts frequently used by people in daily life. Taking cognitive psychology into consideration, we propose a method to generate ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. Using Open Directory Project (ODP) as the benchmark, we demonstrate that the ontology generated by our method is reasonable and consistent with human thinking.

AB  - Network neuroscience research is providing increasing specificity on the contribution of large-scale brain networks to creative cognition. Here, we summarize recent experimental work examining cognitive mechanisms of network interactions and correlational studies assessing network dynamics associated with individual creative abilities. Our review identifies three cognitive processes related to network interactions during creative performance: goal-directed memory retrieval, prepotent-response inhibition, and internally-focused attention. Correlational work using prediction modeling indicates that functional connectivity between networks — particularly the executive control and default networks — can reliably predict an individual’s creative thinking ability. We discuss potential directions for future network neuroscience, including assessing creative performance in specific domains and using brain stimulation to test causal hypotheses regarding network interactions and cognitive mechanisms of creative thought.

AB  - New product development is an essential competence to organizations. Launching success products requires elaborate and precise knowledge about the technological platforms, like the most important market needs and characteristics, and the project team have to employ information systems to support the project decisions, which must be rapid and accurate. However, when the market characteristics are much dynamic and change rapidly or the development project aims at a really new product, the levels of uncertainties are greater, and the project team must employ more robust strategies of risk management. Option thinking is useful to develop several concept alternatives of some crucial subsystems of the new product in order to achieve new technical and market knowledge by repeating cycles of design, built and tested by several and different prototypes in parallel. These different prototypes develop, test and can accumulate knowledge about each one, different technologies, architectures and quality attributes or the usability for potential customers. This study achieves the optimal number of concept options to develop in parallel in order to maximize the economic performance of the development project of a new product constituted of two important subsystems. Mathematical models simulating the sequential decision process are developed to determine the economic result and risk of a two-subsystem product innovation project. Our results point the parallel development of concept options as a robust strategy to manage new product development mostly in adverse conditions, that is, with greater levels of uncertainties.

AB  - Urban activities are an important driver of ecosystem services decline. Sustainable urbanisation necessitates anticipating and mitigating these negative socio-ecological impacts, both within and beyond city boundaries. There is a lack of scalable, dynamic models of changes to ecosystems wrought by urban processes. We developed a system dynamics model, ESTIMUM, to predict locations, types, and magnitude of changes in ecosystem services. We tested the model in Lisbon (Portugal) under four specific urban development scenarios – a base case scenario and three local sustainability-driven scenarios – to the year 2050. Our results show that urban sustainability policies focused on reducing impacts within Lisbon can be undermined by increased impacts in the extended regions that supply resources to the city. In particular, carbon sequestration from urban greening pales in comparison to growing greenhouse gases from the consumption of food, energy and construction materials. We also find that policies targeted at these extended environmental impacts can be much more effective than those with a limited focus on the urban form. For example, dietary shifts could support positive changes outside that city to increase global climate regulation by 54% compared to a mere 1% increase through intensive urban greening. This highlights the urgent need for a reframing of urban sustainability in policy and scholarly circles from city-centric focus towards an expanded multi-scalar conceptualisation of urban sustainability that accounts for urban impacts beyond the city boundaries.

AB  - It is suggested that electromagnetic quantum vacuum fluctuations are at the very deep root of the so-called “specific ions effects” in concentrated solutions or in living cells. A many-body quantum-mechanical frame of thinking is proposed based on the concept of quantum coherence taking into account explicitly density and excitation frequencies of molecules and/or ionic species. It is also proposed that Hofmeister phenomena could have a natural explanation in the harmonic relationships between sets of characteristic frequencies ruled by quantum mechanical laws. It then follows that physical chemistry of concentrated media and biology should be ruled more by a quantum “symphony” between indistinguishable constituents rather than localized two-body electrical interactions between molecular or ionic species.

This chapter expands the definition of smart heritage to include urban technology projects that use sensor-based technologies and physical computing to realize situated and embodied interaction experiences that encourage citizens and visitors to share and co-create cultural heritage experiences with each other. It discusses existing and speculative urban technology projects that combine spatial design and physical computing affordances to create cultural heritage experiences that can be simultaneously attuned to both the past and the future.

AB  - Method development has always been and will continue to be a core driving force of microbiome science. In this perspective, we argue that in the next decade, method development in microbiome analysis will be driven by three key changes in both ways of thinking and technological platforms: ① a shift from dissecting microbiota structure by sequencing to tracking microbiota state, function, and intercellular interaction via imaging; ② a shift from interrogating a consortium or population of cells to probing individual cells; and ③ a shift from microbiome data analysis to microbiome data science. Some of the recent method-development efforts by Chinese microbiome scientists and their international collaborators that underlie these technological trends are highlighted here. It is our belief that the China Microbiome Initiative has the opportunity to deliver outstanding “Made-in-China” tools to the international research community, by building an ambitious, competitive, and collaborative program at the forefront of method development for microbiome science.

AB  - Results Phys. 43, 106048 (2022) has amusingly retrieved some solitonic and other analytic solutions for a shallow water wave equation presented there. In this Letter, we suggest that such an equation be moreover studied in line with Results Phys. 43, 106048 (2022). Employing symbolic computation, for a generalization of that equation, with respect to the displacement and velocity of the water, we construct a family of the similarity reductions, to a known ordinary differential equation. Our results depend on the gravitational force and wave height.

AB  - Quite diverse in their foci and specific themes, the seven articles collected in this special issue are unified by their common conceptual framework. Grounded in the premise that thinking can be usefully defined as self-communicating and that mathematics can thus be viewed as a discourse, the communicational framework provides a unified set of conceptual tools with which to investigate cognitive, affective and social aspects of mathematics learning. The communicational tools are employed by the authors as they investigate diverse aspects of mathematical discourse and explore its development in the classroom and beyond. The seven studies combine together to produce a set of insights, some of which go against widespread beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics.

AB  - The effort to increase the converted power is a common challenge to players in the field of wave energy conversion, both academic and industrial. In the case devices are found to be prone to parametric resonance, it typically has a negative impact on power harvesting and may jeopardize the reliability of the device. This paper makes the case that parametric resonance is not a danger that should be avoided, but rather a chance to achieve a broader system response bandwidth and ultimately increase the amount of power available at the power take-off. Since a time-varying wetted surface causes the highly nonlinear phenomenon of parametric resonance, linear models are unable to fully capture this instability. As a result, nonlinear Froude–Krylov forces are herein implemented via a computationally effective method for prismatic floaters that is compatible with both exhaustive simulation methods and real-time computing, as the whole simulations runs up to 50 times faster than real-time. A novel pendulum-based device is intentionally defined to exhibit a 2:1 ratio between heave and pitch natural frequencies, causing parametric instability. Results demonstrate that linear models predict a single zone of meaningful potential power extraction around the pitch natural frequency, as expected; however, by using the designed attitude to develop parametric instability, a second additional region develops near the heave natural period. As a result, the free response bandwidth is in fact increased, making more energy available at the power take-off axis thanks to the nonlinear instability embedded in the wave energy converter.

AB  - Purpose
The national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan has emphasized on improving content knowledge, reasoning abilities and problem-solving skills of students about thinking, communicating and solving mathematics (national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan, 2006). Whereas, there is a need to understand the point of view of teachers about the challenges they face in achieving the goals of national mathematics curriculum. This will help leading teacher training institutions to revisit their math teacher continuous professional development (CPD) programs and facilitate school leadership in improving the quality of math education in rural schools of the province. However, the purpose of this research study is to figure out the challenges that teachers are facing while achieving the goals of the national curriculum by teaching mathematics at the primary level in educational institutes of Pakistan.
Design/methodology/approach
In this research study qualitative research approaches have been utilized, in which focus group discussions (FGDs) were used as data collection techniques. Furthermore, thematic analysis of the data led toward the development of four overarching themes such as teachers' knowledge about mathematics curriculum, challenges relating to mathematics content and pedagogy, difficulties in developing conceptual understanding and designing lesson plans to address students' diversity.
Findings
The overall findings of this research study suggested that the majority of teachers are facing difficulties in mathematics content teaching such as decimal fraction, unitary method, measurement principles, practical geometry and data handling. Moreover, teachers are also facing challenges and difficulties in developing hands-on and minds-on activities in the teaching of mathematical concepts to the students of primary level in educational institutes of Pakistan.
Practical implications
This research study will facilitate the teachers and stakeholders to address the problematic issues in the domain of content delivery of mathematics. Whereas, this study recommends educating teachers about national mathematics curriculum and to develop a CPD framework for mathematics teachers for the enhancement of their pedagogical content knowledge. The study also recommends orientating school heads about the different aspects of math curriculum so that they can mentor math teachers in achieving math curriculum goals.
Originality/value
This is the first research study of its nature, which targets and highlights the teacher's perceptions toward the achieving the goals of national mathematics curriculum of Pakistan and addressing the pedagogical challenges faced in mathematics teachers. There is a dearth of studies in mathematics education in Sindh province. The issue is of immense importance, the findings will help teachers to improve mathematics instructions at primary level.

AB  - The economic viability of an urban area in terms of trade and shopping significantly impacts its residents’ quality of life and is crucial for any sustainable development initiative. Geographic information systems (GIS) are well established, but the use of GIS technology within finance and trade analysis is still in its infancy. In this article, we highlighted the potential of GIS technology and big data analytics and demonstrated the importance of thinking in spatial terms for analysing patterns within the trade and finance industries. We studied spatiotemporal trade and shopping patterns in the city of Tabriz using data generated by customer purchase transactions obtained from 5200 stores, shopping, business and service centres. We employed time series transaction data collected from the points of sale in stores, shopping, service and business centres located in different areas of the city. We applied four well known geospatial big data driven approaches including machine learning nearest neighbour, kernel density estimation, space–time pattern mining and spatiotemporal coupling tele-coupling for detecting and mapping of spatial trade hotspot patterns. The results of this study indicated the potential of GIScience methods for the explicit spatial mapping of trade and shopping patterns. The results revealed that the city centre, particularly the Bazaar of Tabriz, acts as the city’s heart of trade, and we identify additional major business hotspots. Furthermore, the results allow for studying the impacts of unbalanced urban development in Tabriz, where the wealthy suburbs with high quality of life, such as Valiasr and Elguli, host the major shopping hotspots. The spatial patterns obtained enable local stakeholders, decision makers and authorities to develop strategic plans for urban sustainable development in Tabriz. The geospatial big data approach used can stimulate novel and progressive research. Results of this study demonstrate methodological advancements in GIScience by ’spatializing’ individual purchase data and therefor proposing an explicit geospatial big data analysis approach.

AB  - This article presents a review of important recent themes and developments in research on the learning and teaching of mathematical knowledge and thinking. As a framework, we use a model for designing a powerful environment for learning and teaching mathematics; this model is structured according to four interrelated components, namely competence, learning, intervention, and assessment (CLIA-model) (De Corte et al., 2004). We argue and illustrate that our empirically based knowledge of each of these four interconnected components has substantially advanced over the past decades, enabling a progressively better understanding of not only the components that constitute a mathematical disposition, but also the nature of the learning and developmental processes that should be induced in students to facilitate the acquisition of competence, the characteristics of learning environments that are powerful in initiating and evoking those processes, and finally, the kind of assessment instruments that are appropriate to help monitor and support learning and teaching.

KW  - Fragmentation of futures.
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to present a three-phase periodization of modern Western futures studies to construct historical classification. In order to reach this goal, the following intellectual traditions are introduced to review the philosophical and historical contexts that affect the very foundations of futures studies: (a) religions, (b) utopias, (c) historicism, (d) science fiction, and (e) systems thinking. The first phase (beginning in 1945 to the 1960s) was the era of scientific inquiry and rationalization of the futures characterized by the prevalence of technological forecasting, the rise of alternative futures in systematic ways, and the growth of professionalization of futures studies. In the first phase, futures had become objects of rationalization removed from the traditional approaches such as utopia, grandiose evolutionary ideas, naive prophecies, science fiction, religious attitudes, and mystical orientation. The second phase (the 1970s and the 1980s) saw the creation the global institution and industrialization of the futures. This era was marked by the rise of worldwide discourse on global futures, the development of normative futures, and the deep involvement of the business community in futures thinking. In the second phase, futures studies-industry ties were growing and the future-oriented thoughts extensively permeated the business decision-making process. The third phase (the 1990s – the present) reflects the current era of the neoliberal view and fragmentation of the futures. This phase is taking place in the time of neoliberal globalization and risk society discourses and is characterized by the dominance of foresight, the advance of critical futures studies, and the intensification of fragmentation. In the third phase, futures practice tends to be confined to the support of strategic planning, and hence is experiencing an identity crisis and loss of its earlier status of humanity-oriented futures.

AB  - We here bring together two different traditions of thinking about social capital. One, the Tocquevillian, looks to associations and group memberships as the core of social capital. The other, the Colemanian, looks to interpersonal networks as the core of social capital. We argue that the most common way of articulating how humans use these types of relationships in different ways—the distinction between “bridging” and “bonding” social capital—is epistemically unstable. What might be possible, however, is to use the insights developed by Ronald Burt regarding tie non-redundancy to study associational social capital. We do this by drawing on the insights of the approach consistently adopted and developed by John Mohr, which emphasizes duality and diversity, to develop measures of group affiliation-based social capital. We accordingly, for both Tocquevillian and Colemanian social capital, distinguish measures that focus on the mass of social capital from those that focus on its diversity. To illustrate, we use de-identified data from 77 Million U.S. Facebook Groups users to measure their degree of all resulting types of social capital. We show that our understanding of who has the most social capital varies greatly by whether we are considering Tocquevillian or Colemanian capital, and whether we are focusing on mass or diversity.

AB  - Background and Objectives:
Genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs) represent a valuable modeling and computational tool in the broad field of systems biology. Their ability to integrate constraints and high-throughput biological data enables the study of intricate metabolic aspects and processes of different cell types and conditions. The past decade has witnessed an increasing number and variety of applications of GEMs for the study of human diseases, along with a huge effort aimed at the reconstruction, integration and analysis of a high number of organisms. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature, to pursue several important questions about the application of constraint-based modeling in the investigation of human diseases. Hopefully, this paper will provide a useful reference for researchers interested in the application of modeling and computational tools for the investigation of metabolic-related human diseases.
Methods:
This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Elsevier Scopus®, National Library of Medicine PubMed® and Clarivate Web of Science™ databases were enquired, resulting in 566 scientific articles. After applying exclusion and eligibility criteria, a total of 169 papers were selected and individually examined.
Results:
The reviewed papers offer a thorough and up-to-date picture of the latest modeling and computational approaches, based on genome-scale metabolic models, that can be leveraged for the investigation of a large variety of human diseases. The numerous studies have been categorized according to the clinical research area involved in the examined disease. Furthermore, the paper discusses the most typical approaches employed to derive clinically-relevant information using the computational models.
Conclusions:
The number of scientific papers, utilizing GEM-based approaches for the investigation of human diseases, suggests an increasing interest in these types of approaches; hopefully, the present review will represent a useful reference for scientists interested in applying computational modeling approaches to investigate the aetiopathology of human diseases; we also hope that this work will foster the development of novel applications and methods for the discovery of clinically-relevant insights on metabolic-related diseases.

ABSTRACT
Biology is an increasingly quantitative science. Thus, it is important that undergraduate biology curricula include frequent opportunities for students to practice their quantitative skills. This can create a substantial grading burden for faculty teaching online and/or large enrollment courses, but the “formula question” feature present in many learning management systems (LMS) offers a solution. Using this feature, faculty set up a basic scaffold for an algebraic word problem, and the LMS can then automatically generate and grade many different versions of the question. In this paper, we describe the use of “formula questions” in an undergraduate microbiology course and specifically focus on how the strategic use of algebraic word problems at multiple points throughout the semester can help build quantitative literacy. Key to the success of this approach is that faculty provide a review of foundational mathematical skills early in the semester, even in upper-level classes. This should include reacquainting students with formatting conventions (e.g., rounding and scientific notation), familiarizing them with any idiosyncrasies of the technology platforms, and demonstrating how to solve math problems using spreadsheets. This initial effort increases student success when more complex problems are introduced later in the semester. Though the tips summarized in this paper focus on undergraduate microbiology teaching laboratories using Canvas, the approach can easily be modified to help students develop their critical thinking and quantitative reasoning skills at other levels and in other disciplines.

Here, I present examples from my own work to describe a number of passive bioclimatic approaches focused on the above principles. First, the use of the wind as an expressive element in building design, including the enhancement of air flow in the interior space, the moderation of wind and sand accumulation, the moderation of the sound carried by prevailing winds, and the conversion of the wind into a means of protection against its own force. Second, the use of adaptive building envelopes and shading systems to achieve control of natural light, ventilation and temperature of the inner space through their own transformability, surface openings and materials, including planting as a building material; in a sense, treating buildings as living organisms. Three of these examples have been included in the H2020-MSCA-RISE OptArch project, in which I am scientifically responsible for the work package WP5 entitled “Improvement of bioclimatic design through optimization of performance”.

AB  - Innovative methods in data collection and analytics for pest and disease management are advancing together with computational efficiency. Tools, such as the open-data kit, research electronic data capture, fall armyworm monitoring, and early warning- system application and remote sensing have aided the efficiency of all types of data collection, including text, location, images, audio, video, and others. Concurrently, data analytics have also evolved with the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) for early warning and decision-support systems. ML has repeatedly been used for the detection, diagnosis, modeling, and prediction of crop pests and diseases. This paper thus highlights the innovations, implications, and future progression of these technologies for sustainability.

We also discuss the mathematicians’ perspectives on how they learned and teach computing, and we suggest that much needs to be explored about how to teach computing effectively. Our overarching goal is to draw attention to the importance of the teaching and learning of computing, and we argue that it is an imperative topic of study in mathematics education research.

AB  - In this paper, we trace the rise of heterogeneous household models in mainstream macroeconomics from the turn of the 1980s to the early 2000s, when these models evolved into an identifiable and consistent literature. We show that different communities across the US and Europe considered heterogeneous agents for various reasons and developed models that differed in their theoretical and empirical strategies. Minnesota economists primarily focused on incorporating stochastic heterogeneity into general equilibrium models. Other researchers refined growth models or tried to find alternatives to the permanent income hypothesis, leading them to explore more structural heterogeneity. We also document the computational challenges that some of these communities faced, how they gradually became aware of each other's work, and how they faced criticisms from macro- and microeconomists, many of them trained in European countries and dissatisfied with the theoretical and empirical aggregation strategies underlying these models.

AB  - Recently, Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential modality that utilizes natural and intuitive human mechanisms of thinking process to enable interactions in CAD interfaces. Before BCI could become a mainstream mode of HCI for CAD interfaces; fundamental studies directed towards understanding how humans mentally represent and process the geometry are needed. The outlined work in this paper presents an objective user study to understand shape recognition process in the humans. Specifically, we focus on the fundamental task of fragmentary shape identification. The problem of fragmentary shape recognition can be defined as follows: given a partial and incomplete minimalistic representation of a given shape, can one recognize the actual complete shape or object? In user studies, each subject was progressively (in stages) shown more informative fragmented images of an object to be recognized. During each stage of the experiment, the brain activity of users in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was recorded with a BCI headset. The recorded signals are then processed to objectively study the fragmentary shape recognition process. The results of user studies conclusively show that the measured brain activities of subjects can serve as a very accurate proxy to estimate subjects fragmentary shape recognition process.

AB  - Climate change research and action counteracting it affect everyone and would involve cross-societal transformations reshaping the anthroposphere in its entirety. Scrutinizing climate-related science and policies, we recognize attempts to steer the evolution of climate according to expected (or modelled) futures. Such attempts would turn the anthroposphere into a large “anticipatory system”, in which human society seeks to anticipate and, possibly, to govern climate dynamics. The chief aim of this discussion paper is to open a critical debate on the climate change paradigm (CCP) drawing on a strategic and systemic framework grounded in the concept of anticipatory system sensu Rosen (1991). The proposed scheme is ambitiously intended to turn an intricate issue into a complex but structured problem that is to say, to make such complexity clear and manageable. This framework emerges from concepts borrowed from different scientific fields (including future studies and system dynamics) and its background lies in a simple quantitative literature overview, relying upon a broad level of analysis. The proposed framework will assist researchers and policy makers in thinking of CCP in terms of an anticipatory system, and in disentangling its interrelated (and sometimes intricate) aspects. In point of fact, several strategic questions related to CCP were not subjected to an adequate transdisciplinary discussion: what are the interplays between physical processes and social-political interventions, who is the observer (what he/she is looking for), and which paradigm is being used (or who defines the desirable future). The proposed scheme allows to structure such various topics in an arrangement which is easier to communicate, highlighting the linkages in between, and making them intelligible and open to verification and discussion. Furthermore, ideally developments will help scientists and policy makers address the strategic gaps between the evidence-based climatological assessments and the plurality of possible answers as applied to the geopolitical contingencies.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is one of the new challenges appeared in automatic language processing with the advent of social networks. Taking advantage of the amount of information is now available, research and industry have sought ways to automatically analyze sentiments and user opinions expressed in social networks. In this paper, we place ourselves in a difficult context, on the sentiments that could thinking of suicide. In particular, we propose to address the lack of terminological resources related to suicide by a method of constructing a vocabulary associated with suicide. We then propose, for a better analysis, to investigate Weka as a tool of data mining based on machine learning algorithms that can extract useful information from Twitter data collected by Twitter4J. Therefore, an algorithm of computing semantic analysis between tweets in training set and tweets in data set based on WordNet is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on machine learning algorithms and semantic sentiment analysis can extract predictions of suicidal ideation using Twitter Data. In addition, this work verify the effectiveness of performance in term of accuracy and precision on semantic sentiment analysis that could thinking of suicide.

AB  - This case study uses the Framework for Teachers’ Robust Understanding of Proportional Reasoning for Teaching (Weiland et al., 2020) to characterize how 51 mathematics teachers solved a comparison proportional problem. We found 50 of the 51 teachers productively drew upon four knowledge resources: (1) proportional situation, (2) ratios as part: part or part: whole, (3) unit rates, and (4) ratio as measure. This study details these and teachers’ less commonly used knowledge resources, as well as counterproductive statements related to the knowledge resources. We analyze the structure of the comparison proportion problem and suggest why teachers drew on particular knowledge resources. Lastly, we highlight how counterproductive statements highlight areas of focus for mathematics teacher educators and extends the operationalizing of the robust proportional reasoning framework for mathematics education researchers.
