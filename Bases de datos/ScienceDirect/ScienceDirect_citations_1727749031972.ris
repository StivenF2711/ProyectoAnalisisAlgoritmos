AB  - Internet+ecosystems, big data applications, customers’ specific demands, and internal and external values integration of enterprises pose new challenges to inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. To confront these challenges, this paper integrates computational experiment and data analysis, and proposes a methodology for data-driven computational experiments for inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. It explores a paradigm shift to the development of data-driven computational experiments that supports decision making in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations. A basic principle for integrated solutions generation in the parallel worlds of virtual reality interaction is studied and the corresponding key issues in the paradigm are analyzed. To support the paradigm and solve key issues, a six-layered framework with four viewpoints for data-driven computational experiments is proposed. This framework systematically presents conceptual and technical solutions for data-driven computational experiments and decision support in the domain of inter-organizational collaborations in supply chain networks. The effectiveness of the framework is verified by theoretical analysis and a case study.

AB  - In the last years, the System 1/System 2 cognitive architecture, proposed by psychologist Daniel Kahneman, raised the interest of many researchers in the field. System 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast-thinking system working effortlessly, without conscious effort. System 2 is a deliberate, analytical, and slower-thinking system employing conscious effort and attention. This work proposes an innovative approach that exploits techniques typical of information retrieval (the trie data structure) to efficiently encode the solutions’ repository at the border between System 2 and System 1. This repository stores the solutions (successful plans) the agent has already used and can re-enact to achieve the goals. System 2 conceives new plans and delegates System 1 to execute them. If the plan is successful (and so it becomes a solution), System 1 stores that in the repository to quickly retrieve any solution that may help fulfil the goals deliberated by System 2 in the future.

AB  - From a brain processing perspective, the perception of creative thinking is rooted in the underlying cognitive process, which facilitates exploring and cultivating novel avenues and problem-solving strategies. However, it is challenging to emulate the intricate complexity of how the human brain presents a novel way to uncover unique solutions. One potential approach to mitigating this complexity is incorporating creative cognition into the evolving artificial intelligence systems and associated neural models. Hopfield neural network (HNN) are commonly acknowledged as a simplified neural model, renowned for their biological plausibility to store and retrieve information, specifically patterns of neurons. Our findings suggest utilizing modern HNN to emulate creative thinking by making meaningful associations between seemingly disparate concepts. This semantic link is represented as a radio knob that can be set to determine whether the network solves problems creatively or shuts down; the threshold is a parameter. We used the term "first knob of creativity" to describe a certain pattern and utilized the "second knob of creativity" to aid in the examination of alternatives within the network. By manipulating the knobs, it is possible to selectively suppress specific patterns, facilitating the creative functioning of the HNN and identifying other patterns with which input can be linked.

AB  - Management accounting system (MAS) improves business growth through quality decision making process, but scholars have mixed views about MAS and constantly debate its efficacy. Drawing on the decision-making theories, the current research deviates from the debates and adopts a ‘think-outside-the-box’ approach, aiming to advance the knowledge of MAS's efficacy. Research data are gathered from the MAS literatures and cognate studies. Following the research findings, we identify a new pre-factor (thinking style) and incorporate it into the MAS. Specifically, decision makers' cognitive process is found to affect the design and implementation of MAS, as rational thinking style, administrative thinking style, and political thinking style may affect the MAS's efficacy differently. Research findings have brought valuable insights to the MAS literatures, by highlighting the strength and weakness of different thinking styles in designing management accounting system. Moreover, decision makers, such as organizational leaders and business managers, are encouraged to monitor their thinking styles: that is, with better understanding of thinking styles, decision makers can better utilize MAS and rectify the style-driven deficits in time.

AB  - For the geneticist or breeder, the individual animal is like a potential masterpiece resulting from years of attention to physical details and planned matings. The importance of culturing and nourishing this individual to not only reach its potential but to pass its selected genetics on to progeny is paramount. Thus, all the investment in genetic improvement is now at the mercy of management. Once the goats are in the herd on the farm and the responsibility of the farmer or farm manager, the expression and proliferation of the genotype will be strongly influenced by environmental factors. If maximum milk production per lactation were the real and only goal that could promise farm business and land sustainability, genetic selection would be easy. However, the real goal on farms is to have healthy goats that produce efficiently and are adapted to their environment. This places the development of the goat breeding program in the hands of farmers. To aid farmers in moving beyond the use of total milk production per goat as the feedback mechanism to farm sustainability, the integration of more appropriate progress indicators could include longevity (which, in humans, is estimated at 20% genetic and 80% environmental), the amount of milk or milk component production per body weight of goat, and the degree of involuntary culling.

AB  - Competitive industrialization pressures the construction sector to move activities away from the construction site, contemplating the prefabricated elements use. Companies willing to remain in the competitive market must seek new positions and developments in their production and management chains. To support the managers' decision-making about the prefabricated concrete elements production line, this article presents a computer simulation model for prefabricated pillars production line productivity scenarios creation. The data used for this model development were collected through a case study in the production line of prefabricated pillars. A simulation software modelled the production line with a dashboard that enables multiple-scenario generation. The adopted approach works with stochastic data, allowing nonprogrammer users to: manipulate and control scenarios and layout settings, analyze results through a dashboard and provide management and decision-makers with a comprehensive view of possible solutions.
L’industrialisation concurrentielle pousse le secteur de la construction à s’éloigner du chantier, en envisageant l’utilisation des éléments préfabriqués. Les entreprises désireuses de demeurer sur le marché concurrentiel doivent rechercher de nouvelles positions et de nouveaux développements dans leurs chaînes de production et de gestion. Pour aider les gestionnaires à prendre des décisions au sujet de la ligne de production d’éléments préfabriqués en béton, cet article présente un modèle de simulation informatique pour la création de scénarios de productivité de ligne de production de piliers préfabriqués. Les données utilisées pour l’élaboration de ce modèle ont été recueillies au moyen d’une étude de cas sur la chaîne de production de piliers préfabriqués. Un logiciel de simulation a modélisé la ligne de production avec un tableau de bord permettant l’élaboration de scénarios multiples. L’approche adoptée fonctionne avec des données stochastiques, permettant aux utilisateurs non-programmeurs : de manipuler et contrôler les scénarios et les paramètres de mise en page, d’analyser les résultats au moyen d’un tableau de bord et de fournir à la direction et aux décideurs une vue d’ensemble des solutions possibles.

AB  - M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1-AChR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family, plays a crucial role in learning and memory, making it an important drug target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. M1-AChR activation and deactivation have shown modifying effects in AD and PD preclinical models, respectively. However, understanding the pharmacology associated with M1-AChR activation or deactivation is complex, because of the low selectivity among muscarinic subtypes, hampering their therapeutic applications. In this regard, we constructed two quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models, one for M1-AChR agonists (total and partial), and the other for the antagonists. The binding mode of 59 structurally different compounds, including agonists and antagonists with experimental binding affinity values (pKi), were analyzed employing computational molecular docking over different structures of M1-AChR. Furthermore, we considered the interaction energy (Einter), the number of rotatable bonds (NRB), and lipophilicity (ilogP) for the construction of the QSAR model for agonists (R2 = 89.64, QLMO2 = 78, and Qext2 = 79.1). For the QSAR model of antagonists (R2 = 88.44, QLMO2 = 82, and Qext2 = 78.1) we considered the Einter, the fraction of sp3 carbons fCsp3, and lipophilicity (MlogP). Our results suggest that the ligand volume is a determinant to establish its biological activity (agonist or antagonist), causing changes in binding energy, and determining the affinity for M1-AChR.

AB  - In an increasingly competitive society with an unfavourable economic environment, it is necessary for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to update themselves, thereby increasing their efficiency. Companies increasingly use computational tools to support the development of predictive scenarios in order to facilitate decision-making. However, the tools developed for SMEs are not always expedite and simple to use. The tool presented in this article intends to support the management of energy sources used by agro-industrial companies. It aims to facilitate and promote the implementation of a new culture of business management, in this sector so important at national level. The computational part is directed to support the decision-making on the selection of fossil or renewable energy sources to be used in a particular agroindustry, by presenting the average values of the energy consumption, cost and emissions associated with each selected energy source.

AB  - Most research on skill acquisition and retention focuses on the individual being tested. Yet sometimes another person is responsible for evaluating the individual’s performance. Here, we study the acquisition and retention of rater skill using data for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). Our work is based on the idea that response scoring, like other cognitive skills, will gradually improve with amount of practice, and decline with elapsed time since that practice occurred. These classic findings are the focus of a computational cognitive model called the Predictive Performance Equation (PPE). However, the generalizability of these findings to response scoring and the applicability of PPE to that domain have not yet been demonstrated. To address this issue, we leveraged a naturalistic dataset containing rating performance from over 23,000 sessions. Our analyses provide empirical support for PPE and establish a basis for using a model like PPE to personalize rater training requirements.

AB  - Social scientists of class and inequality have documented the rise of omnivorousness, informality, ordinariness, and emphasis on meritocracy. This apparent decline in class closure contrasts sharply with rising inequality and declining economic mobility. How are these competing developments reflected in everyday class distinction-making? In this article, we answer this question by applying Goffman's work on the symbols of class status to the analysis of unique data: a corpus of etiquette books published between 1922 and 2017. We use word embeddings to quantify the salience of six class concepts (affluence, cultivation, education, employment, morality, and status) in the corpus. We find that education and employment are increasingly salient while status, affluence, cultivation, and morality decline in their salience to class distinction-making. These results signal a decline of class operating as a status group through cultural closure, the rise of education and employment as the carriers of class in everyday life, and the corresponding legitimation of class position and class inequality based on supposedly meritocratic grounds. This research opens up new avenues for studies of class and the application of computational methods to investigations of social change.

AB  - Despite unprecedented access to information, partisans increasingly disagree about basic facts that are backed by data, posing a serious threat to a democracy that relies on finding common ground based on objective truths. We examine the underpinnings of this phenomenon using drift diffusion modeling (DDM). Partisans (N = 148) completed a sequential sampling task where they evaluated the honesty of Democrat or Republican politicians during a debate based on fact-check scores. We found that partisans required less and weaker evidence to correctly categorize the ingroup as more honest, and were more accurate on trials when the ingroup candidate was more honest, compared to the outgroup. DDM revealed that such tendencies arise from both a prior preference for categorizing the ingroup as more honest (i.e., biased starting point) and more precise accumulation of information favoring the ingroup candidate compared to the outgroup (i.e., biased drift rate). Moreover, individual differences in cognitive reasoning moderated task performance for the most devoted partisans and maintained divergent associations with the DDM parameters. This suggests that partisans may reach biased conclusions via different pathways depending on their depth of cognitive reasoning. These findings provide key insights into the mechanisms driving partisan divides in polarized environments, and can inform interventions that reduce impasse and conflict.

AB  - Computational physics problems often have a common set of aspects to them that any particular numerical code will have to address. Because these aspects are common to many problems, having a framework already designed and ready to use will not only speed the development of new codes, but also enhance compatibility between codes. Some of the most common aspects of computational physics problems are: a grid, a clock which tracks the flow of the simulation, and a set of models describing the dynamics of various quantities on the grid. Having a framework that could deal with these basic aspects of the simulation in a common way could provide great value to computational scientists by solving various numerical and class design issues that routinely arise. This paper describes the newly developed computational framework that we have built for rapidly prototyping new physics codes. This framework, called turboPy, is a lightweight physics modeling framework based on the design of the particle-in-cell code turboWAVE. It implements a class (called Simulation) which drives the simulation and manages communication between physics modules, a class (called PhysicsModule) which handles the details of the dynamics of the various parts of the problem, and some additional classes such as a Grid class and a Diagnostic class to handle various ancillary issues that commonly arise.

AB  - Self-organizing attractor networks may comprise the building blocks for cortical dynamics, providing the basic operations of categorization, including analog-to-digital conversion, association and auto-association, which are then expressed as components of distinct cognitive functions depending on the contents of the neural codes in each region. To assess the viability of this scenario, we first review how a local cortical patch may be modeled as an attractor network, in which memory representations are not artificially stored as prescribed binary patterns of activity as in the Hopfield model, but self-organize as continuously graded patterns induced by afferent input. Recordings in macaques indicate that such cortical attractor networks may express retrieval dynamics over cognitively plausible rapid time scales, shorter than those dominated by neuronal fatigue. A cortical network encompassing many local attractor networks, and incorporating a realistic description of adaptation dynamics, may be captured by a Potts model. This network model has the capacity to engage long-range associations into sustained iterative attractor dynamics at a cortical scale, in what may be regarded as a mathematical model of spontaneous lateral thought.

AB  - Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), the increase and decrease in instantaneous heart rate (HR) with inspiration and expiration, is commonly evaluated as function of breathing frequency f. However, to the extent that RSA plays a role in the efficiency of gas exchange, it may be expected to correlate better with HR/f (‘breathing specific heart rate’) than with f, because the former is a better reflection of the cardio-respiratory coupling. We measured RSA breath-by-breath in 209 young men and women during spontaneous breathing and during volitional breathing under auditory cues at vastly different f. In either case, and for both genders, RSA correlated better with HR/f than with f. As HR/f increased so did RSA, in a linear manner. When compared on the basis of HR/f, RSA did not differ significantly between spontaneous and volitional breathing. It is proposed that RSA is a central mechanism that ameliorates the matching between the quasi-continuous pulmonary blood flow and the intermittent airflow, irrespective of the type of ventilatory drive (cortical or autonomic).

AB  - This paper proposes a novel algorithm for fast and accurate Hausdorff distance (HD) computation. The Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity between two point sets in various applications. However, it is hard to compute the HD algorithm efficiently between very large-scale point sets while ensuring the accuracy of the HD. The directed HD algorithm has two loops (called the outer loop and the inner loop) for calculating MAX-MIN distance, and the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Early break method and the Diffusion search method, focused on reducing the iterations of the inner loop. Our algorithm, however, concentrates on reducing the iterations of the outer loop. The proposed method simultaneously computes the temporary HD and temporary minimum distances of points corresponding to the outer loop using the opposite HD computation with very small systematic samples. Thereafter, a strategy of ruling out is employed to exclude non-contributing points. The new approach reduces the problems of different grid sizes and highly overlapping point sets as well as the very large-scale point sets. 3-D point clouds and real brain tumor segmentation (MRI 3-D volumes) are used for comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art HD algorithms. In experimental results with 3-D point clouds, the proposed method is more than at least 1.5 times as faster as the compared algorithms. And, in experimental results with MRI 3-D volumes, the proposed method achieves a better performance than the compared algorithms over all pairs regardless of the grid size. Thus, as a whole, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.

AB  - In this paper, it is analyzed how emotions and social environment affect people's active and reflective learning processes. First, a conceptual analysis is made using recent insights from Cognitive, Affective and Social Neuroscience on the roles of emotions and social interactions on learning. Next, a computational analysis is made using a computational model of learning processes following these insights. In this analysis, neural mechanisms for the impact of both a person's own emotions and the emotions of others are taken into account. In particular, it is considered how these impacts influence different learning types, such as active or reflective learners. The analysis shows how the impacts of emotions and social interaction strengthen the learning process. It is discussed how from these insights indicators can be obtained that can be used to design technology-enhanced learning environments able to exploit these impacts.

AB  - The Puzzle-based Learning approach has been applied to several fields of knowledge. In education research papers, the instructional usage of puzzles is considered to improve learners' motivation and engagement and help them to develop critical skills but difficulties concerning learners' interaction with puzzles have also been pointed out. Our paper investigates the dynamics of the concept of a puzzle and its interface to provide a better understanding of its form and functions, and help learners interact with puzzles. We consider Puzzle-based Learning tenets as well as their educational impacts on both critical thinking and learner engagement and provide an original proposal concerning the understanding of puzzles. Our proposal centered on the dynamics of puzzles bears conceptual and educational facets. Conceptually, puzzle dynamics is viewed as composed of two elements: a mechanism, the Puzzle Trigger, and a process, the Puzzle-Solving. From an educational point of view, the rationale for integrating Puzzle Triggers in Puzzle-based Learning is meant to help learners interact with puzzles and consequently become motivated and engaged in the Puzzle-Solving process. This way, learners' critical thinking skills are reinforced and focused on finding solutions to challenges. We illustrate the implementation of Puzzle Triggers and Puzzle-Solving by considering two instructional activities in a Software Development undergraduate course of an online learning Informatics Engineering Program.

AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to (1) determine the feasibility of collecting behavioral data from participants hospitalized with acute psychosis and (2) begin to evaluate the clinical information that can be computationally derived from such data.
Methods
Behavioral data was collected across 99 sessions from 38 participants recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit. Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical “clinical rounds” encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
Analysis
We quantified aspects of participants' verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants' PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures.
Results
Our predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains.
Conclusion
Our interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis.

AB  - Biomanufacturing, which uses renewable resources as raw materials and uses biological processes to produce energy and chemicals, has long been regarded as a production model that replaces the unsustainable fossil economy. The construction of non-natural and efficient biosynthesis routes of chemicals is an important goal of green biomanufacturing. Traditional methods that rely on experience are difficult to support the realization of this goal. However, with the rapid development of information technology, the intelligence of biomanufacturing has brought hope to achieve this goal. Retrobiosynthesis and computational enzyme design, as two of the main technologies in intelligent biomanufacturing, have developed rapidly in recent years and have made great achievements and some representative works have demonstrated the great value that the integration of the two fields may bring. To achieve the final integration of the two fields, it is necessary to examine the information, methods and tools from a bird's-eye view, and to find a feasible idea and solution for establishing a connection point. For this purpose, this article briefly reviewed the main ideas, methods and tools of the two fields, and put forward views on how to achieve the integration of the two fields.

AB  - Computational architecture for object-driven cortex Objects in motion activate multiple cortical regions in every lobe of the human brain. Do these regions represent a collection of independent systems, or is there an overarching functional architecture spanning all of object-driven cortex? Inspired by recent work in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cognitive science, we consider the hypothesis that these regions can be understood as a coherent network implementing an integrative computational system that unifies the functions needed to perceive, predict, reason about, and plan with physical objects—as in the paradigmatic case of using or making tools. Our proposal draws on a modeling framework that combines multiple AI methods, including causal generative models, hybrid symbolic-continuous planning algorithms, and neural recognition networks, with object-centric, physics-based representations. We review evidence relating specific components of our proposal to the specific regions that comprise object-driven cortex, and lay out future research directions with the goal of building a complete functional and mechanistic account of this system.

AB  - Human milk is a complex and dynamic biological system that has evolved to optimally nourish and protect human infants. Yet, according to a recent priority-setting review, “our current understanding of human milk composition and its individual components and their functions fails to fully recognize the importance of the chronobiology and systems biology of human milk in the context of milk synthesis, optimal timing and duration of feeding, and period of lactation.” We attribute this critical knowledge gap to three major reasons as follows. (i) Studies have typically examined each subsystem of the mother-milk-infant “triad” in isolation and often focus on a single element or component (e.g., maternal lactation physiology or milk microbiome or milk oligosaccharides or infant microbiome or infant gut physiology).
ABSTRACT
Human milk is a complex and dynamic biological system that has evolved to optimally nourish and protect human infants. Yet, according to a recent priority-setting review, “our current understanding of human milk composition and its individual components and their functions fails to fully recognize the importance of the chronobiology and systems biology of human milk in the context of milk synthesis, optimal timing and duration of feeding, and period of lactation” (P. Christian et al., Am J Clin Nutr 113:1063–1072, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab075). We attribute this critical knowledge gap to three major reasons as follows. (i) Studies have typically examined each subsystem of the mother-milk-infant “triad” in isolation and often focus on a single element or component (e.g., maternal lactation physiology or milk microbiome or milk oligosaccharides or infant microbiome or infant gut physiology). This undermines our ability to develop comprehensive representations of the interactions between these elements and study their response to external perturbations. (ii) Multiomics studies are often cross-sectional, presenting a snapshot of milk composition, largely ignoring the temporal variability during lactation. The lack of temporal resolution precludes the characterization and inference of robust interactions between the dynamic subsystems of the triad. (iii) We lack computational methods to represent and decipher the complex ecosystem of the mother-milk-infant triad and its environment. In this review, we advocate for longitudinal multiomics data collection and demonstrate how incorporating knowledge gleaned from microbial community ecology and computational methods developed for microbiome research can serve as an anchor to advance the study of human milk and its many components as a “system within a system.”

AB  - Providing computational problems for enhancing students’ abstraction skills and monitoring how students make abstractions is difficult in block-based programming environments (BBPEs). Thus, concrete examples and principles are needed to guide computer science teachers about understanding and enhancing students’ abstractions. This study aims to examine the effect of using block-based coding environments on enhancing secondary school students’ abstraction skills. Referring to the programming knowledge, a rubric was created to analyze the data from screen recordings, observation and interviews were used together to reveal the students’ abstraction performances. The results suggested that students performed high in elimination, focusing and generalization; however, students’ performances were relatively low in customization. Students’ explanations were mostly related the nature of the problems, affordances of BBPE and the programming constructs used in coding. We hope the study will provide insights for the efforts on instructional designs for successful abstraction experiences for young students.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) is the dominant management tool for marine environments around the world and is an attempt to move beyond the sectoral governance of marine spaces. Scotland is no exception and MSP is central to its management plans. The interpretation and use of spatial data informs these plans and maps provide the backbone of the decision-making process. Whilst not refuting MSP as a governance tool, this paper examines more closely some of the inherent problems with representing marine environments spatially and how the practice of map-making inevitably interacts with social-ecological networks. Borrowing from critical cartography and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), four observations are made: 1) due to the necessary procedure of categorising and simplifying data, maps do not always accurately represent changeable marine environments and situations; 2) maps can produce reality as much as represent it; 3) mapping has become the point through which all actors and stakeholders must pass; 4) as they are obliged to pass through this point, the roles and definition of certain actors can change. This discussion of marine spatial planning in Scotland demonstrates what can be learnt from viewing marine spaces as a tightly coupled social-ecological environment.

AB  - The interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) based medical diagnostic systems is crucial to make the diagnosis adequately convincible. Deep learning has been extensively investigated and utilized in the area of medical assistance diagnosis in recent decades due to its outstanding performance and objective prediction. However, a huge semantic chasm dividing clinicians and unexplainable deep models emerges. Here we design a brain-inspired inference framework from medical images to explainable features, then to the final diagnostic conclusions. The fast thinking module is responsible for recognizing medical features in ultrasound (US) images, and the slow-thinking module builds a model for inferring from medical features to diagnostic results by constructing a knowledge graph of medical features with tensor decomposition. The whole model infers through intuition and thinking like a human being, and gives the recognized medical image features while inferring the diagnosis, which greatly improves the interpretability of the model. We conducted studies on thyroid cancer diagnoses using US images. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) characteristics are employed as medical features describing thyroid nodules. Our brain-inspired medical inference framework outperforms commonly used deep learning algorithms, with an AUC score of 0.963 (95% confidential interval (CI)=0.923–1.000) for thyroid US image diagnosis. Results indicate that our framework improves diagnostic objectivity and interpretability while providing performance that is better than deep models. Our proposed brain-inspired medical inference framework could improve the efficiency of diagnosis and our technique is performant, objective and interpretable.

AB  - Modern philosophy of mind cannot be understood without recent developments in computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, neuroscience, biology, linguistics, and psychology. Classical philosophy of formal languages as well as symbolic AI assume that all kinds of knowledge must explicitly be represented by formal or programming languages. This assumption is limited by recent insights into the biology of evolution and developmental psychology of the human organism. Most of our knowledge is implicit and unconscious. It is not formally represented, but embodied knowledge, which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with changing environments. That is true not only for low-level skills, but even for high-level domains of categorization, language, and abstract thinking. The embodied mind is considered an emergent capacity of the brain as a self-organizing complex system. Actually, self-organization has been a successful strategy of evolution to handle the increasing complexity of the world. Genetic programs are not sufficient and cannot prepare the organism for all kinds of complex situations in the future. Self-organization and emergence are fundamental concepts in the theory of complex dynamical systems. They are also applied in organic computing as a recent research field of computer science. Therefore, cognitive science, AI, and robotics try to model the embodied mind in an artificial evolution. The paper analyzes these approaches in the interdisciplinary framework of complex dynamical systems and discusses their philosophical impact.

AB  - Biophysical modeling of development started with Alan Turing. His two-morphogen reaction-diffusion model was a radical but powerful simplification. Despite its apparent limitations, the model captured real developmental processes that only recently have been validated at the molecular level in many systems. The precision and robustness of reaction-diffusion patterning, despite boundary condition-dependence, remain active areas of investigation in developmental biology.

AB  - Research has shown that solving counting problems correctly can be difficult for students at all levels, and mathematics educators have sought to identify strategies and interventions to help students reason conceptually about combinatorial tasks. A set-oriented perspective (Lockwood, 2014) is a way of thinking about counting problems that emphasizes the importance of reasoning about the set of outcomes being counted. From a set-oriented perspective, one possible type of intervention is to have students focus on the sets of outcomes rather than formulas and expressions, and specifically to reason about the structure of the set of outcomes. Yet, reasoning about sets of outcomes is not sufficient for students to make connections between outcomes and counting processes. In this paper, we investigate tasks where students wrote computer code to enumerate the set of outcomes in a specific order by implementing listing processes, and they were then asked to determine a specific numbered outcome in their list by using the structure of their enumeration scheme. We clarify particular aspects of a set-oriented perspective that were productive for students, and we demonstrate that tasks that asked students to name a specific outcome in their list elicited meaningful connections between counting processes and sets of outcomes. Further, such tasks reinforce desirable mathematical practices such as leveraging structure and connecting representations.

AB  - Systems biology is centrally engaged with computational modelling across multiple scales and at many levels of abstraction. Formal modelling, precise and formalised abstraction relationships, and computation also lie at the heart of computer science—and over the past decade a growing number of computer scientists have been bringing their discipline's core intellectual and computational tools to bear on biology in fascinating new ways. This paper explores some of the apparent points of contact between the two fields, in the context of a multi-disciplinary discussion on conceptual foundations of systems biology.

AB  - Background
Hypoxaemia during general anaesthesia can cause harm. Apnoeic oxygenation extends safe apnoea time, reducing risk during airway management. We hypothesised that low-flow nasal oxygenation (LFNO) would extend safe apnoea time similarly to high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO), whilst allowing face-mask preoxygenation and rescue.
Methods
A high-fidelity, computational, physiological model was used to examine the progression of hypoxaemia during apnoea in virtual models of pregnant women in and out of labour, with BMI of 24–50 kg m−2. Subjects were preoxygenated with oxygen 100% to reach end-tidal oxygen fraction (FE'O2) of 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. When apnoea started, HFNO or LFNO was commenced. To simulate varying degrees of effectiveness of LFNO, periglottic oxygen fraction (FgO2) of 21%, 60%, or 100% was configured. HFNO provided FgO2 100% and oscillating positive pharyngeal pressure.
Results
Application of LFNO (FgO2 100%) after optimal preoxygenation (FE'O2 90%) resulted in similar or longer safe apnoea times than HFNO FE'O2 80% in all subjects in labour. For BMI of 24, the time to reach SaO2 90% with LFNO was 25.4 min (FE'O2 90%/FgO2 100%) vs 25.4 min with HFNO (FE'O2 80%). For BMI of 50, the time was 9.9 min with LFNO (FE'O2 90%/FgO2 100%) vs 4.3 min with HFNO (FE'O2 80%). A similar finding was seen in subjects with BMI ≥40 kg m−2 not in labour.
Conclusions
There is likely to be clinical benefit to using LFNO, given that LFNO and HFNO extend safe apnoea time similarly, particularly when BMI ≥40 kg m−2. Additional benefits to LFNO include the facilitation of rescue face-mask ventilation and ability to monitor FE'O2 during preoxygenation.

AB  - Despite continual debate for the past 30 years about the function of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), its key contribution to neurocognition remains unknown. However, recent computational modeling work has provided insight into this question. Here we review computational models that illustrate three core principles of ACC function, related to hierarchy, world models, and cost. We also discuss four constraints on the neural implementation of these principles, related to modularity, binding, encoding, and learning and regulation. These observations suggest a role for ACC in hierarchical model-based hierarchical reinforcement learning (HMB-HRL), which instantiates a mechanism motivating the execution of high-level plans.

AB  - Gonorrhea is an urgent antimicrobial resistance threat and its therapeutic options are continuously getting restricted. Moreover, no vaccine has been approved against it so far. Hence, the present study aimed to introduce novel immunogenic and drug targets against antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. In the first step, the core proteins of 79 complete genomes of N. gonorrhoeae were retrieved. Next, the surface-exposed proteins were evaluated from different aspects such as antigenicity, allergenicity, conservancy, and B-cell and T-cell epitopes to introduce promising immunogenic candidates. Then, the interactions with human Toll-like receptors (TLR-1, 2, and 4), and immunoreactivity to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses were simulated. On the other hand, to identify novel broad-spectrum drug targets, the cytoplasmic and essential proteins were detected. Then, the N. gonorrhoeae metabolome-specific proteins were compared to the drug targets of the DrugBank, and novel drug targets were retrieved. Finally, the protein data bank (PDB) file availability and prevalence among the ESKAPE group and common sexually transmitted infection (STI) agents were assessed. Our analyses resulted in the recognition of ten novel and putative immunogenic targets including murein transglycosylase A, PBP1A, Opa, NlpD, Azurin, MtrE, RmpM, LptD, NspA, and TamA. Moreover, four potential and broad-spectrum drug targets were identified including UMP kinase, GlyQ, HU family DNA-binding protein, and IF-1. Some of the shortlisted immunogenic and drug targets have confirmed roles in adhesion, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance that can induce bactericidal antibodies. Other immunogenic and drug targets might be associated with the virulence of N. gonorrhoeae as well. Thus, further experimental studies and site-directed mutations are recommended to investigate the role of potential vaccine and drug targets in the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae. It seems that the efforts for proposing novel vaccines and drug targets appear to be paving the way for a prevention-treatment strategy against this bacterium. Additionally, a combination of bactericidal monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics is a promising approach to curing N. gonorrhoeae.

AB  - This article adopts a neuroeconomics perspective on the study of the neural computations of human social interaction. Reported findings support a cognitive hierarchy model of human brain and behavior, according to which people use different levels of strategic thinking that are associated with specific neural computations. A higher level is associated with recursive thinking, which is the realization that others can also produce any thought process that we produce, while low level reflects self-referential thinking. The medial prefrontal cortex clearly distinguishes high level versus low level of strategic thinking, thus encoding the complexity underlying human social behavior.

AB  - Introduction
A central feature of schizophrenia is the disorganization and impoverishment of language. Recently, we observed higher semantic similarity in first-episode-schizophrenia (FES) patients. In this study, we investigate if this aberrant similarity relates to the ‘causal’ connectivity between two key nodes of the word production system: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the semantic-hub at the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL).
Methods
Resting-state fMRI scans were collected from 60 participants (30 untreated FES and 30 healthy controls). The semantic distance was measured with the CoVec semantic tool based on GloVe. A spectral dynamic causal model with Parametrical Empirical Bayes was constructed modelling the intrinsic self-inhibitory and extrinsic-excitatory connections within the brain regions. We estimated the parameters of a fully connected model with the semantic distance as a covariate.
Results
FES patients chose words with higher semantic similarity when describing the pictures compared to the HC group. Among patients, an increased semantic similarity was related with an increase in intrinsic connections within both the vATL and IFG, suggesting that reduced ‘synaptic gain’ in these regions likely contribute to aberrant sampling of the semantic space during discourse in schizophrenia.
Conclusions
Lexical impoverishment relates to increased self-inhibition in both the IFG and vATL. The associated reduction in synaptic gain may relate to reduced precision of locally generated neural activity, forcing the choice of words that are already ‘activated’ in a lexical network. One approach to improve word sampling may be via promoting synaptic gain via supra-physiological stimulation within the Broca's-vATL network; this proposal needs verification.

AB  - Engineering students, as compared to computing-related majors, are not traditionally introduced to computing in the context of authentic learning experiences, i.e., real-world applications within their discipline. This paper identifies the impact of computation delivered by authentic learning experiences in the form of anchored instruction on students' self-beliefs and their capacity to leverage computation to acquire disciplinary concepts in subsequent computationally-based engineering coursework. This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. Implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving.

AB  - Pharmaceutical R&D transforms scientific ideas into drugs on the market. Owing to the complexity and low overall success rate, Drug Discovery needs to be as much about science as about operational excellence. In vitro screening groups, underwriting early discovery from exploratory to candidate selection, are trying to combine the search for new scientific concepts with a production-like focus on logistics, reproducibility and delivery on time. Moving beyond high-throughput technologies, we begin to ask how to improve processes and work more seamlessly across functional lines. In this context lean methods have become a front runner in discussions at drug discovery meetings. What are these methods and are they delivering what is promised, or are we looking at yet another management initiative?

Many of these limitations can be overcome or addressed through computer modeling. To help make this argument, the current chapter provides a broad, accessible overview to the study of computational models of learning and development. First, we explore the technical vocabulary of computational modeling research by reviewing a set of basic concepts, including the different kinds of representations that are employed by computational models, as well as the array of learning algorithms that are typically used. Next, we review four major types of models: connectionist models, dynamic field theory models, rule-based models, and Bayesian models. In the final section, we put these concepts and approaches into practice by surveying findings from models that simulate the development of object knowledge, language learning, and motor-skill acquisition.

AB  - Computational human geography refers to the use of computational methods and techniques to solve problems in human geography research and applications. The approach goes back to the beginnings of the quantitative revolution in geography and is philosophically related though methodologically distinct from it. Geographic information systems (GIS) and science are a big part of computational human geography, but the latter notion is considerably broader, encompassing spatial process modeling and simulation, the modeling of spatial decision and behavior, visualization techniques, spatial analysis, and an increasing number of new research areas and methods enabled by the most recent technological developments. The latter are discussed under the rubrics of The Data Revolution, Urban (Spatial) Informatics, and Ambient Computing. Two major thrusts have persisted throughout the years: the use of numerical techniques to solve large, complex quantitative problems; the development of models of complex spatial processes expressed directly in computational terms. Both have evolved with the times and continue to be central to computational human geography. Critiques originate from both within the field and from the humanities and social theory perspectives. These address epistemological and methodological problems as well as issues of ontology and representation.

AB  - Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we investigate the generic representations of human functions and machine operations in the same framework for execution on the current computers, i.e., how a machine would execute human functions and conversely how a human would execute machine functions. This approach would facilitate the encoding of the (common) human functions as precisely as the machine language instructions for a computer. Conversely, the approach would facilitate the transfer of the lower-level intelligence of a human being into the adaptation of the HW, SW, and FW modules of an intelligent machine. Though not entirely feasible, the approach digs deep inroads in how human intelligent-machines can be and conversely, how robotic mundane-human beings can be. The later situation occurs in prisoner-, slave-, military-camps. The methodology is practical since machines have already started to imitate human behavior and some of the human tasks are routine and programmable into the robots. The challenge lies when some of the higher levels functions (such as conceptualize, hypothesize, optimize, generalize, axiomize, etc.) of human beings need to be programed into intelligent machines, even though middle level functions (such as summarize, generalize, rationalize, etc.) can be forced by appropriate knowledge-ware (KW) into intelligent machines. These middle level functions are encoded into the KW by searching for embedded knowledge centric objects (KCOs) in human beings, cultures, societies, and other contributing objects. Related and pertinent knowledge is found by exploring the local and the Internet knowledge bases (KBs) and selecting the attributes of these objects and or related objects. The Chapter outlines and elaborates the proposed approach.

AB  - This article aims to conceptualize design-based education (DBE) in STEM educational settings and provide examples of current DBE practices followed by discussing the gaps of current DBE. We define DBE as educational theory and practice that integrate and transform design processes and design thinking into learning experiences. DBE is well-aligned with the 21st century STEM education because it can enhance learner-centered pedagogy, learners' critical thinking, collaboration, interest-driven learning, and integrative STEM learning. More attention to concrete strategies for the integrative STEM education in DBE and systems of preparing educators for DBE is needed for better learning experiences.

AB  - The paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.

AB  - A new method for extracting common themes from written text is introduced and applied to 1165 open-ended self-descriptive narratives. Drawing on a lexical approach to personality, the most commonly-used adjectives within narratives written by college students were identified using computerized text analytic tools. A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves.

AB  - Block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”.

AB  - Secure multiparty computation (SMC) allows for complex computations over encrypted data. Privacy concerns for cloud applications makes this a highly desired technology and recent performance improvements show that it is practical. To make SMC accessible to non-experts and empower its use in varied applications, many domain-specific compilers are being proposed. We review the role of these compilers and provide a formal treatment of the core steps that they perform to bridge the abstraction gap between high-level ideal specifications and efficient SMC protocols. Our abstract framework bridges this secure compilation problem across two dimensions: 1) language-based source- to target-level semantic and efficiency gaps, and 2) cryptographic ideal- to real-world security gaps. We link the former to the setting of certified compilation, paving the way to leverage long-run efforts such as CompCert in future SMC compilers. Security is framed in the standard cryptographic sense. Our results are supported by a machine-checked formalisation carried out in EasyCrypt.

AB  - Philosophers as well lay people often think of beliefs as psychological states with dubious epistemic properties. Beliefs are conceptualized as unregulated conceptual structures, for the most part hypothetical and often fanciful or deluded. Thinking and reasoning on the other hand are seen as rational activities regulated by rules and governed by norms. Computational modeling of the mind has focused on rule-governed behavior, ultimately trying to reduce them to rules of logic. What if thinking is less like reasoning and more like believing? I argue that the classical model of thought as rational is mistaken and that thinking is fundamentally constituted by believing. This new approach forces us to re-evaluate classical epistemic concepts like “truth”, “justification” etc. Furthermore, if thinking is believing, then it is not clear how thoughts can be modeled computationally. We need new mathematical ideas to model thought, ideas that are quite different from traditional logic-based mathematical structures.

AB  - Data processing and learning has become a spearhead for the advancement of medicine, with pathology and laboratory medicine has no exception. The incorporation of scientific research through clinical informatics, including genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, into clinical practice unlocks innovative approaches for patient care. Computational pathology is burgeoning subspecialty in pathology that promises a better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, computational pathology faces several challenges, including the ability to integrate raw data from different sources, limitation of hardware processing capacity, and a lack of specific training programs, as well as issues on ethics and larger societal acceptable practices that are still solidifying. The establishment of the entire industry of computational pathology requires far-reaching changes of the three essential elements connecting patients and doctors: the local laboratory, the scan center, and the central cloud hub/portal for data processing and retrieval. Computational pathology, unlocked through information integration and advanced digital communication networks, has the potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality, and ultimately create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients. This review describes clinical perspectives and discusses the statistical methods, clinical applications, potential obstacles, and future directions of computational pathology.

AB  - Three recent breakthroughs due to AI in arts and science serve as motivation: An award winning digital image, protein folding, fast matrix multiplication. Many recent developments in artificial neural networks, particularly deep learning (DL), applied and relevant to computational mechanics (solid, fluids, finite-element technology) are reviewed in detail. Both hybrid and pure machine learning (ML) methods are discussed. Hybrid methods combine traditional PDE discretizations with ML methods either (1) to help model complex nonlinear constitutive relations, (2) to nonlinearly reduce the model order for efficient simulation (turbulence), or (3) to accelerate the simulation by predicting certain components in the traditional integration methods. Here, methods (1) and (2) relied on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, with method (3) relying on convolutional neural networks. Pure ML methods to solve (nonlinear) PDEs are represented by Physics-Informed Neural network (PINN) methods, which could be combined with attention mechanism to address discontinuous solutions. Both LSTM and attention architectures, together with modern and generalized classic optimizers to include stochasticity for DL networks, are extensively reviewed. Kernel machines, including Gaussian processes, are provided to sufficient depth for more advanced works such as shallow networks with infinite width. Not only addressing experts, readers are assumed familiar with computational mechanics, but not with DL, whose concepts and applications are built up from the basics, aiming at bringing first-time learners quickly to the forefront of research. History and limitations of AI are recounted and discussed, with particular attention at pointing out misstatements or misconceptions of the classics, even in well-known references. Positioning and pointing control of a large-deformable beam is given as an example.

AB  - A growing trend of integrating and teaching Informatics and Computational Thinking (CT) skills at primary education levels poses different challenges for teachers. Research demonstrates that it is challenging to introduce Informatics in schools without well-prepared teachers. In this paper, we examine Lithuanian teachers' perceptions of the barriers and drivers to integrate the renewed Informatics curricula in primary education and the relation between them. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. The results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn Informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating Informatics. The study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of Informatics. The study provides knowledge that could, for instance, benefit teacher training programmes and help better understand how teachers can be better supported to meet current and future challenges.

AB  - The saturated and unsaturated rings in the tautomers of (Z)-4-(hydroxyethyl) isochroman-1, 3-dione (EIC) and 4-acetyl-3-hydroxyisochroman-1-one (AOC) are found to be nonplanar. All the DFT and ab-initio computational methods with various basis sets identify EIC as the global minimum in S0. IRC and frequency computations locate the transition states (TS). AOC and TS are located about 3.5 ± 0.5 kcal/mole and 4.5 ± 0.8 kcal/mole higher in energy than EIC. The transition region is clearly marked with the evaluation of reaction force and force constants. CIS and TDDFT computations show inconsistent results. MHP is obeyed by the EIC tautomer, while MEP is obeyed by the TS structure. Frontier molecular orbitals confirms the S0 → S1 transition as π-π* in nature. The vibrational signatures in the tautomers corresponding to CO stretching modes and ring modes are identified. The earlier observed 1740 cm-1C = O stretching mode is computed to appear at 1763 cm−1 in EIC.

Motivated by this survey, we suggest steps to facilitate quantitative and computational training for future neuroscientists.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has only partially (or not at all) been integrated into medical education, leading to growing concerns regarding how to train healthcare practitioners to handle the changes brought about by the introduction of AI. Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.

AB  - The use of hybrid computational intelligence is currently broadening in the field of healthcare applications and research. Computational intelligence has played a vital role in health care for a significant period of time, but with the increased popularity and extensive use of these hybrid computational intelligent systems, a shift has been seen also in the field of health care. Hybrid computational intelligence can be implied in the field of decision making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, and modern information systems. Hybrid computational intelligence synergizes different computational intelligence techniques, such as the neural network, the fuzzy logic, the genetic algorithms, the evolutionary computation and the support vector machines, and have their application in the field of pattern recognition, system modeling, etc. In this chapter, we focus on the need for healthcare information technology, improvement of healthcare delivery systems, healthcare safety issues, and also various areas where it can be used.

AB  - Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.

AB  - The switch from a mined-carbon-based society to a bio-carbon based society requires a major shift not only of the resources,but alsoin the typeof processes that produce the products on which ourcivilizationbuilds;a richer approach to handling and production is required. Natural products from renewable sources will substitute today'spurely synthetic products from fossil resources, associated waste streams will have to be utilized for the production of usable materials, with chemical processing being one of the main options.Fuel represents a main class of chemicals that we increasingly rely on. They have to be substituted as quick as possible as they represent the largest use of mined carbon. The paper presents some of the stumbling blocks which prohibit the transfer and high lights the most needed research objectives.

AB  - Technology-based instruction represents a new recent pedagogical paradigm that is rooted in the realization that new generations are much more comfortable with, and excited about, new technologies. The rapid technological advancement over the past decade has fueled an enormous demand for the integration of modern networking, informational and computational tools with classical pedagogical instruments. Consequently, teaching with technology typically involves utilizing a variety of IT and multimedia resources for online learning, course management, electronic course materials, and novel tools of communication, engagement, experimental, critical thinking, and assessment. The NSF-funded Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) provides a number of interactive tools for enhancing instruction in various undergraduate and graduate courses in probability and statistics. These resources include online instructional materials, statistical calculators, interactive graphical user interfaces, computational and simulation applets, tools for data analysis and visualization. The tools provided as part of SOCR include conceptual simulations and statistical computing interfaces, which are designed to bridge between the introductory and the more advanced computational and applied probability and statistics courses. In this manuscript, we describe our designs for utilizing SOCR technology in instruction in a recent study. In addition, present the results of the effectiveness of using SOCR tools at two different course intensity levels on three outcome measures: exam scores, student satisfaction and choice of technology to complete assignments. Learning styles assessment was completed at baseline. We have used three very different designs for three different undergraduate classes. Each course included a treatment group, using the SOCR resources, and a control group, using classical instruction techniques. Our findings include marginal effects of the SOCR treatment per individual classes; however, pooling the results across all courses and sections, SOCR effects on the treatment groups were exceptionally robust and significant. Coupling these findings with a clear decrease in the variance of the quantitative examination measures in the treatment groups indicates that employing technology, like SOCR, in a sound pedagogical and scientific manner enhances overall the students’ understanding and suggests better long-term knowledge retention.

AB  - Chaos, complexity and computation are especially important concepts with respect to both the Evolution of biological systems and the evolution of the Universe. We consider each of these five entities separately, and then view their combination in an overall consideration of both evolution and Evolution. The concept of computation can be directly derived from processes characteristic of the Evolution of biology or the evolution of the Universe, rather than presumed from our own mathematical ideas. We advocate the inclusion of meaning in science's deliberations, and support this by insisting that physically embodied abstractions should be considered part concrete in character. Combination of our initial five conceptual entities indicates that biological Evolution follows the same developmental criteria as the evolution of the Universe, albeit with an intermediate change in strategy. We conclude that evolutionarily derived computation is the prime driver of evolution/Evolutions' implications.

AB  - Today’s organizations are witnessing a growing complexity in making interconnected decisions. Where individuals have a wider range of decisions to influence, the consequence of decisions far more propagate across the system, and the business environment continually influences the status of the system. Predicting the cascading effects of decisions in such situations would be very problematic yet can have several implications for managers and executives to think beyond organizational silos and make local decision with a bigger picture of emergent consequences in mind. A prominent challenge within this realm is the ever-increasing complexity of decision propagations, especially when incorporating the role and influence of people involved in decision-making. This paper tackles this challenge from an engineering change perspective, with the focus on computing the compound risk of decisions when their consequences concurrently propagate across the system. We introduce an interactive tool called Virtual Net Propagator, which incorporates organizational dynamics into decision analysis, with the aim to identify change opportunities and effective set of interventions. Illustrated by a field engineering case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed tool can provide detailed knowledge on how decisions are interconnected and how systemic (cascading) effects of a decision propagate through causal pathways, so highlighting key influencers along with role and influence of interfacing (hidden) players.

AB  - Narrative creativity training has recently shown promise as a tool for increasing self-efficacy and resilience in adult learners. The training employs dramatic and literary techniques such as perspective-shifting, counterfactual (i.e., what-if) thinking, and causal (i.e., why) thinking to improve real-world problem solving. To explore whether narrative creativity training could have similar benefits for younger populations, this study piloted a test on elementary students. A five-minute randomized controlled trial conducted with 32 third, fourth, and fifth grade students yielded increased self-efficacy and creative problem-solving, and a five-day longitudinal trial conducted with 28 students from the same population was associated with increased resilience. The results suggest the potential practical benefits of incorporating theater, literature, comics, and other story-based art into elementary school curricula.

AB  - Traditional supervised classifications for remote sensing-based water quality monitoring count on a set of classifiers to retrieve features and improve their prediction accuracies based on ground truth samples. However, many existing feature extraction methods in remote sensing are unable to exhibit multiple-instance nonlinear spatial pattern recognition at scales via ensemble learning. This paper designed for lake algal bloom monitoring presents intelligent feature extraction for harmonizing local and global features via tensor flow-based ensemble learning with integrated biomimetic and computational intelligence. To explore such complexity, an Integrated Biomimetic and Ensemble Learning Algorithm (IBELA) was developed to synthesize the contribution from different classifiers associated with the biomimetic philosophy of integrated bands. It leads to strengthened multiple-instance spatial pattern recognition in lake algal bloom monitoring via image fusion at the decision level. With the implementation of IBELA, a case study of a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Managua, for water quality monitoring leads to demonstrate six input visual senses showing different impacts on retrieving Chl-a concentrations in the dry and wet season, respectively. The input of total nitrogen from the watershed plays the most important role in water quality variations in both seasons in a watershed-based food–water nexus. Although ultraviolet and microwave bands are important in the dry season, Secchi disk depth is critical in the wet season for water quality monitoring.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between the gate opening process of working memory and an individual's proficiency in divergent (DT) and convergent thinking (CT) using the reference-back paradigm. Event-related potentials and reaction times were measured across groups with varying DT (N = 40, 27.35 ± 5.05 years) and CT levels (N = 40, 27.88 ± 4.95 years). Based on the role of striatal dopamine in supporting cognitive flexibility, which facilitates DT, and considering the significance of phasic dopamine activity as the gate opening signal originating from the basal ganglia, we assumed that the gate opening process may contribute differently to DT and CT. Despite the absence of behavioural differences in gate opening costs, distinct neural patterns emerged. In the early time windows (P1, N1), gate opening effects were detected in both DT and CT groups, with a notable interaction influenced by the level of DT, resulting in significant effects within the lower DT group. The P2 component showed a gate opening effect only in the higher DT group. In the P3 time window, the process unfolded comparably in all groups. Our results suggest that groups with different levels of convergent thinking (based on Matrix reasoning) and those with lower DT (based on Creativity Index) tend to select and activate the prefrontal cortex representation containing the required task information at an earlier stage, compared to those with better DT. This could be beneficial especially in the early phase of idea generation, as more elements become available to create associations and original ideas.

Given that the poor drug solubility in aqueous media is a big challenge in pharmaceutical industry, nanomedicines would help improve the drug solubility in aqueous media. The solubility of fludrocortisone acetate in supercritical carbon dioxide is modelled in this research using various machine learning methods because it is a crucial aspect of the expansion of the pharmaceutical business. For this purpose, the accessible data have two input features: a pressure range of 120–300 (bar) and a temperature range of 308–338 (K). MLP, v-SVR and MLR are the basic models used in this research, but not their raw versions. They are improved for modeling drug solubility and coupled with the grey wolf optimization (GWO) in order to optimize the models. The models optimized by GWO showed acceptable results, but among these models, MLP regression has shown better results when coupled with this optimization algorithm. This model has the RMSE error rate of 2.98 × 10−2 and its R2 score is 0.9797 in correlating the solubility data of the medicine.

AB  - Summary
Neural activity is often described in terms of population-level factors extracted from the responses of many neurons. Factors provide a lower-dimensional description with the aim of shedding light on network computations. Yet, mechanistically, computations are performed not by continuously valued factors but by interactions among neurons that spike discretely and variably. Models provide a means of bridging these levels of description. We developed a general method for training model networks of spiking neurons by leveraging factors extracted from either data or firing-rate-based networks. In addition to providing a useful model-building framework, this formalism illustrates how reliable and continuously valued factors can arise from seemingly stochastic spiking. Our framework establishes procedures for embedding this property in network models with different levels of realism. The relationship between spikes and factors in such networks provides a foundation for interpreting (and subtly redefining) commonly used quantities such as firing rates.

AB  - The present work addresses energy consumption in raceway ponds (RWPs). This kind of systems are today the most utilized industrial plant for outdoor algae cultivation. The problem has been addressed combining theoretical correlations and experimental data. Head losses for conventional raceway ponds were evaluated, and the results were compared with data available in literature. Computational fluid dynamics was used to support the theoretical analysis. This study suggested possible improvements to the traditional RWP design: an Innovative Raceway Pond (IRP II) was therefore designed, built and operated in parallel with a reference pilot RWP in a test site. Several modifications to traditional RWP design were implemented in the IRP II: the paddle wheel was substituted by a propeller, the water head was reduced and baffle boards were installed in the curves. To validate the new design, head losses and therefore energy consumption in the different systems were evaluated, during cultivation experiments, with two microalgae strains. The theoretical and experimental study allowed a validated calculation, which showed the importance of concentrated head losses towards distributed ones. The analysis highlighted how these losses weight at different pond scales, suggesting possible improvements of the RWP energy performance – as achieved in the IRP II – through revised design for optimized mixing.

AB  - This study provides insight into New York City residents' perceptions about violence after the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on information from communities in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) buildings. In this novel analysis, we used focus group and social media data to confirm or reject findings from qualitative interviews. We first used data from 69 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with low-income residents and community stakeholders to further explore how violence impacts New York City's low-income residents of color, as well as the role of city government in providing tangible support for violence prevention during co-occurring health (COVID-19) and social (anti-Black racism) pandemics. Residents described how COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement impacted safety in their communities while offering direct recommendations to improve safety. Residents also shared recommendations that indirectly improve community safety by addressing long term systemic issues. As the recruitment of interviewees was concluding, researchers facilitated two focus groups with 38 interviewees to discuss similar topics. In order to assess the degree to which the themes discovered in our qualitative interviews were shared by the broader community, we developed an integrative community data science study which leveraged natural language processing and computer vision techniques to study text and images on public social media data of 12 million tweets generated by residents. We joined computational methods with qualitative analysis through a social work lens and design justice principles to most accurately and holistically analyze the community perceptions of gun violence issues and potential prevention strategies. Findings indicate valuable community-based insights that elucidate how the co-occurring pandemics impact residents' experiences of gun violence and provide important implications for gun violence prevention in a digital era.

AB  - The digital tectonic studies noticed the dramatic change of traditional architectural construction in association with digital technology. A more systematic framework of new tectonics combining digital and classic elements and processes is needed to explore the digital theory in the architecture field. The first step of this case-study research is to determine both the analytical factors of classic tectonics and the digital cases. The next step discusses emergent digital factors of tectonics. The third step applies the four new factors to the tectonic processes of five digital projects by well-known architects who have actual building experience in both predigital and digital works. Some phenomena of digital tectonics have emerged to reveal the dynamic factors of motion, information, generation and fabrication. In a preliminary framework of new tectonics, seven classic and four digital factors form a whole and interact with each other.

Objective measures like the verbal fluency test are often used to determine language dysfunction. Recent applications of computational approaches broaden insights into language-related functions. In addition, individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric or neurological disorder also often report subjective difficulties in language-related functions. Therefore, we investigated the association between objective and subjective measures of language functioning, on the one hand, and inter-individual structural variations in language-related brain areas, on the other hand. We performed a Latent Semantic analysis (LSA) on a semantic verbal fluency task in 101 healthy adult participants. To investigate if these objective measures are associated with a subjective one, we examined assessed subjective natural tendency of interest in language-related activity with a study-specific questionnaire. Lastly, a voxel-based brain morphometry (VBM) was conducted to reveal associations between objective (LSA) measures and structural changes in language-related brain areas. We found a positive correlation between the LSA measure cosine similarity and the subjective interest in language. Furthermore, we found that higher cosine similarity corresponds to higher gray matter volume in the right cerebellum. The results suggest that people with higher interests in language access semantic knowledge in a more organized way exhibited by higher cosine similarity and have larger gray matter volume in the right cerebellum, when compared to people with lower interests. In conclusion, we demonstrate that there is inter-individual diverseness of accessing the semantic knowledge space and that it is associated with subjective language interests as well as structural differences in the right cerebellum.

AB  - A problem occurs when a situation is in one state, the problem solver wants it to be in another state, and there are obstacles preventing a smooth transition from the given state to the goal state. Problem solving refers to cognitive processing aimed at overcoming a problem. This entry examines the definitions of key terms, types of problems, phases in problem solving, and types of knowledge involved in problem solving. This entry also explores findings about problem solving that are most relevant to education including research on rigidity in thinking, problem solving transfer, productive thinking, insight, computer simulation of problem solving, problem solving in realistic situations, and teaching of thinking.

AB  - Within organisational learning literature, mental models are considered a vehicle for both individual learning and organizational learning. By learning individual mental models (and making them explicit), a basis for formation of shared mental models for the level of the organization is created, which after its formation can then be adopted by individuals. This provides mechanisms for organizational learning. These mechanisms have been used as a basis for an adaptive computational network model. The model is illustrated by a not too complex but realistic case study.

AB  - ABSTRACT
In the realm of enantioselective Diels–Alder reactions, a role of primary importance is held by Mg-BOX catalysis. The main features of both catalysts and ligand in directing the stereoselective outcome have been extensively studied in several papers mainly through 1H NMR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. However, over the years, no computational studies have been reported to support the models proposed to rationalize the observed stereoselectivity for the reaction between 3-acryloyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one and cyclopentadiene catalyzed by the BOX ligand (R,R)-(+)-2,2′-isopropylidenebis­(4-phenyl-2-oxazoline) and Mg­(II) salts. To approach the problem, we performed a density functional theory (DFT) computational study, aiming to locate the preferred transitions states deriving from these proposed models, but we only found a correspondence in selectivities for the reaction catalyzed by Mg­(OTf)2, where the model suggests an octahedral complex with the two triflate anions coordinating magnesium. For the other cases [i.e., Mg­(ClO4)2, Mg­(ClO4)2·2H2O, and MgI2·I2], the commonly accepted tetrahedral or octahedral models suggest no involvement of the perchlorate or iodide anions, but the corresponding calculations did not reproduce the experimental selectivities. Only when we considered also in these cases coordination complexes involving their presence, the observed selectivities were reproduced, thus opening new insights to better understand the role and the action of the counterion to determine the stereochemical outcome of these reactions.

AB  - Undoubtedly, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the production of a voluminous amount of data, which can be exploited towards the delineation and identification of novel pharmacogenomics (PGx) associations. Herein, we describe how NGS and genome-wide association (GWA) technologies have changed the landscape of the pharmacogenomics field, whilst proceeding with thorough details on the contribution of rare pharmacogenomics variants to the heritability of drug response trait. Moreover, we summarize some state-of-the-art text mining techniques which if harnessed properly can lead to a plethora of PGx retrieved associations. Overall, we conclude by stating that there is often a knowledge gap between (clinical) pharmacologists and researchers who exploit (pharmaco)genomics big data by using advanced computing methods. To overcome the limited number of advanced computational, statistical and mathematical methods and protocols, we propose a broad implementation and standardization of NGS techniques that should be explored by the PGx community.

AB  - Computational experiment approach considers modelling as the essential feature of Inquiry Based Science Education (IBSE), where the model and the computer take the place of the “classical” experimental set-up and simulation replaces the experiment (Landau, Pαez, & Bordeianu, 2008). Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Recent developments in strategy instruction research suggest that learning in a particular discipline is enhanced by guiding students through the development of content-relevant metacognitive strategies (Wosnitza & Volet, 2009). Problem-solving is a complex process, which involves several cognitive operations such as collecting and selecting information, heuristic strategy and metacognition (De Corte, 2003, Garofalo and Lester, 1985, Schoenfeld, 1994). The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the Computational Experiment Methodology on learners' cognitive performance, use of modelling indicators and shift of the metacognitive experiences during problem solving using computational models. Sixty prospective primary school teachers volunteered to participate in the study. Students were exposed by the Instructor to a number of computational experiments, while during the course they developed their own models of simulation. The results of the experiment show that the use of the computational experiment approach has a substantial effect on the metacognitive experiences and the use of modelling indicators.

AB  - The proposed investigation is aimed at providing useful suggestions and guidelines for the renovation of educational buildings, in order to do University classrooms safe and sustainable indoor places, with respect to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. Classrooms and common spaces have to be thought again, for a new “in-presence” life, after the recent worldwide emergency following the spring 2020 pandemic diffusion of COVID-19. In this paper, starting from a real case study, and thus the architectural and technological refurbishment of an Italian University building (Campobasso, South Italy, cold climate), with the aims of improving the classrooms’ quality and safety, a comprehensive approach for the retrofit design is proposed. By taking into account the necessary come back to classrooms starting, hopefully, from the next months (Autumn 2020), experimental studies (monitoring and investigations of the current energy performances) are followed by the coupling of different numerical methods of investigations, and thus building performance simulations, under transient conditions of heat transfer, and computational fluid dynamics studies, to evidence criticalities and potentialities to designers involved in the re-thinking of indoor spaces hosting multiple persons, with quite high occupancy patterns. Both energy impacts, in terms of monthly and annual increase of energy demands due to higher mechanical ventilation, and indoor distribution of microclimatic parameters (i.e., temperature, airspeed, age of air) are here investigated, by proposing new scenarios and evidencing the usefulness of HVAC systems, equipment (e.g., sensible heat recovery, without flows’ contamination) and suitability of some strategies for the air distribution systems (ceiling squared and linear slot diffusers) compared to traditional ones.

AB  - Understanding algebraic properties is a key component of building mathematical thinking across grades K-8, yet less is known about the development of students' use of mathematical properties within their strategies. This article presents results from four conversations with 24 5th-grade students over a school year, that focus on examining the development of students grouping within strategies for multiplication and division problems. Findings add to previous research on student strategies within multiplication and division by detailing some of the nuances in students' use of grouping. Additionally, a focus on student strategies reveals students' progression in more explicit use of grouping underlies the development of more planful use of the distributive and associative properties of multiplication.

The proposed framework has been implemented in mediator-based electrochemical biosensors, where the inability to recycle the cofactors in situ without compromising the functionality of the whole system remains a pending issue. The opening of technology channels between the two domains may, also, contribute to solving the problem of enzyme stability in industrial catalysis.

AB  - Survival prompts organisms to prepare adaptive behavior in response to environmental and social threat. However, what are the specific features of the appearance of a conspecific that trigger such adaptive behaviors? For social species, the prime candidates for triggering defense systems are the visual features of the face and the body. We propose a novel approach for studying the ability of the brain to gather survival-relevant information from seeing conspecific body features. Specifically, we propose that behaviorally relevant information from bodies and body expressions is coded at the levels of midlevel features in the brain. These levels are relatively independent from higher-order cognitive and conscious perception of bodies and emotions. Instead, our approach is embedded in an ethological framework and mobilizes computational models for feature discovery.

AB  - This article investigates those aspects of computation that concern uncertainty, contingency and indeterminacy. Starting from a critique of current dominant models of computation, and drawing on the philosophical notions of the virtual and the event, uncertainty, contingency and indeterminacy are proposed as virtualities that express the ongoing differentiation of digital matter. On these grounds, the glitch is reframed as an event capable of revealing the potential of the digital in processes of computational making. Ideas concerning the incomputable and non-human intelligence of the algorithm underpin this argument. Finally, it is proposed that intuitive and uncognitive modes of apprehending digital making operate as forms of divination that capture the unprogrammed unfolding of matter.

AB  - Given the current focus on teaching computational concepts to all from an early age, combined with the growing trend to empower end users to become producers of technology rather than mere consumers, we consider the issue of “computational notation”. Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.

On the basis of self-efficacy and trust in institutions, and by applying cluster analyses, we obtain evidence for four distinct groups labelled as Fatalists, Collaboratives, Activists, and Delegants. The four groups express systematic variations in social representation. We discuss the theoretical and practical impacts of these results.

We show that the results yielded by this automated approach are correlated with results given by humans and can be used to predict expected behavior in the field. Educators and researchers may utilize this approach to address the limitations of subjective scoring, save time, and use the AUT as a tool for cultivating creativity.
