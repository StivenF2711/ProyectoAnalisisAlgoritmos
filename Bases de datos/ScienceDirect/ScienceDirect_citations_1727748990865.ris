AB  - The article proposes a research agenda for computational empowerment for emerging technologies in the field of child–computer interaction (CCI) – in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). This research agenda includes three levels of operation for future studies: (1) participatory practice, capable of engaging teachers and students in co-developing and designing approaches for teaching and learning emerging technologies, (2) educational principles for integrating technological and societal aspects of emerging technologies, and (3) digital tools for engaging students in construction of and critical reflection on emerging technologies. The research agenda was developed from longitudinal studies of the respective emerging technologies in Danish K–12 education, participatory design research with in-service teachers, development of novel tools and technologies, and literature studies of current CCI research. The paper addresses current gaps in the CCI literature and contributes a coherent approach and guiding questions for future CCI research on computational empowerment for emerging technology in education.

AB  - Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.

AB  - This study is a digital form-finding and manual fabrication experiment in woven architectural design, with one traditional weaving style, Kagome, used to scale the craft up into an architectural-scale bamboo woven artifact. Kagome is a trihexagonal pattern employed in traditional bamboo basketry as a triaxial weaving system, resulting in an object with a self-bracing capacity without the use of fasteners owing to its interlacing lattices. Although existing studies and tools have addressed triaxial weaving design and representation, the current consideration of the advantages of weaving with bamboo is insufficient. To address this research gap, this study develops a computational design method based on studies on bamboo basketry. This allows for the representation and exploration of design geometries using combinations of regular triangular meshes for the fabrication of Kagome woven bamboo artifacts. A full-scale mock-up was fabricated to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The mock-up demonstrated the self-bracing properties of Kagome, but there were discrepancies between the mock-up and the design. Factors affecting bamboo weaving on an architectural scale have been identified within this study to inform future research on woven bamboo structures.

We discuss the roles of the two approaches, using as a reference case study the appointment scheduling process in a hematological center of a large Italian hospital. We report on how lean tools have been deployed to improve the process, we present a mathematical optimization model and discuss its implementation. Our aim is to show that the joint use of lean thinking and mathematical optimization can disclose large benefits when they are properly integrated in the improvement process. In our case study, simulated experiments point out that the average patient lead time could be decreased by more than 30%.

Drawing upon case studies from new media education and the digital humanities, the paper argues that design thinking that is situated, interpretive, and user-oriented is well suited to these initiatives. The paper concludes with a call for design thinking research to engage with emerging models for learning and knowledge production, work whose effects could be felt at an epistemic level for generations.

The final version of the MISQ consisted of four constructs: scientists’ cognitive, affective, lifestyle, and job characters. The results showed that senior high school students gave higher scores for scientists’ cognitive character construct than junior high and elementary school students did. Students from eastern regions, which have a more highly developed economy, gave the highest scores on cognitive and affective character constructs of scientists. Students from western regions, which have a less developed economy, had a relatively negative impression of scientists. Students’ images of scientists’ affective, lifestyle, and job characters were positively correlated with their interests in pursuing scientific careers. Future research to explore the relationships between students’ mental images of scientists’ characters and students’ motivation to pursue science-related careers or to engage in scientific practices are recommended.

AB  - A novel method of AC sensing is presented that uses a double nanohole (DNH) nanoaperture atop a solid-state nanopore (ssNP) to trap analytes and measure their optical and electrical properties. In this method analytes are propelled by an external applied voltage towards the sensor until they are trapped at the DNH-ssNP interface via a self-induced back action (SIBA) plasmonic force. We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here, we extend this method to AC sensing of 20 nm SiO2 (silica) nanoparticles, using voltage modulation over a wide range of frequencies applied on top of a baseline DC bias. The sensor was constructed using two-beam GFIS Focused Ion Beam (FIB) lithography, incorporating Ne FIB to mill the DNH and He FIB to drill a central 30 nm ssNP. We utilized COMSOL Multiphysics simulations to explore the multi-frequency AC current conductance properties of the silica nanoparticles trapped at the SANE sensor. These simulations computed conductance changes and phase shifts induced by the presence of the nanoparticle over an AC frequency range of 20 Hz to 100 kHz. Experimental measurements confirmed the trends seen in the computational data. Additional computational studies were then performed to dissect the underlying mechanisms driving the observed AC measurements. Looking forward, we aim to adapt this technology for probing therapeutic nanoparticles non-invasively, offering a promising tool for enhancing quality control of nanoparticle-mediated drug and gene delivery systems.

We propose a method to make self-referential contradiction a dynamic process of interaction with the selves in first person and third person description. The process represents thinking as inner dialogue with the self in second person. The dynamic effect of the rewrite shows characters proper to internal measurement, disequilibration by equilibration and transfer of inconsistency to the neighborhood by local resolution of the inconsistency. As the result, the advent of contradiction is postponed by the rewrite. The duality of internal measurement subject prevents inner dialogue in second person from lapsing into monologue. Criticality of thinking process is expressed. A probabilistic interpretation of non-determinacy weakening oracle is the key.

AB  - Whereas computational empowerment is well established in child–computer interaction research, less effort has been made to integrate this approach in practice. Building on four existing principles in child–computer interaction, namely Closeness, Embodied Learning, Design Process and Decoding, we explore how computational empowerment can be scaffolded in practice. This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project exploring emerging technologies in education (CEED). We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies. Based on qualitative data from this intervention, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for child–computer interaction in moving toward computational empowerment in practice.

AB  - This study revisits a classic yet still intriguing question regarding information technology (IT): what difference does IT “really” make, in terms of people's thinking? In order to explore this question, the effects of IT in authentic research settings were studied through retrospective interviews with 24 academic researchers. Analysis of the researchers’ descriptions of their learning and thinking processes shows that the effects of IT on higher order thinking strategies can be classified, following Perkins [Perkins, D. N. (1985). The fingertip effect: How information processing technology changes thinking. Educational Researcher, 14(7), 11–17], into first order effects and second order effects. First order effects of IT amplify or improve existing thinking strategies, without changing their nature, while second order effects of IT cause significant changes in the researchers’ thinking strategies. The results demonstrate that both types of effects take place in authentic research settings, often existing side by side. This article explores several examples of the ways in which IT affects higher order thinking strategies (such as forming research questions, constructing models and evaluating information), examines the types of effects created by IT, the conditions required for these effects to take place, and the role of distributed cognition.

AB  - The evolving nature of system-of-systems requirements and corresponding architecture, and the complex causal relationship between the architecture of system-of-systems and its emergent behavior make the problem of system-of-systems architecture development a great challenge. As a tentative effort in meeting this special challenge, a new evolutionary computation paradigm–named Cognition Evolutionary Computation(CEC) is proposed, which models the creative cognition process of divergent and convergent thinking, adaptation and innovation, that drives the co-evolution of problem space, knowledge space and solution space. The optimization algorithm for CEC uses causal probabilistic network as the knowledge representation mechanism. A theoretical framework for CEC based system-of-system architecture generation, evaluation and optimization is discussed.

We examine how (i) cognitive load, (ii) the affective-richness of the product, and (iii) the consumer's propensity for intuitive decision-making influence relative thinking. As hypothesized, high cognitive load and affect-rich (vs. affect-poor) products, and individual level preference for intuitive decision-making aggravate this behavior. Our results present clear managerial implications along with developing a better understanding of the behavioral foundations of relative thinking.

AB  - Prior research has shown that greater EEG alpha power (8–13 ​Hz) is characteristic of more creative individuals, and more creative task conditions. The present study investigated the potential for machine learning to classify more and less creative brain states. Participants completed an Alternate Uses Task, in which they thought of Normal or Uncommon (more creative) uses for everyday objects (e.g., brick). We hypothesized that alpha power would be greater for Uncommon (vs. Common) uses, and that a machine learning (ML) approach would enable the reliable classification data from the two conditions. Further, we expected that ML would be successful at classifying more (vs. less) creative individuals. As expected, alpha power was significantly greater for the Uncommon than for the Normal condition. Using spectrally weighted common spatial patterns to extract EEG features, and quadratic discriminant analysis, we found that classification accuracy for the two conditions varied widely among individuals, with a mean of 63.9%. For more vs. less creative individuals, 82.3% classification accuracy was attained. These findings indicate the potential for broader adoption of machine learning in creativity research.

AB  - Nowadays, cancer is causing a serious health issue worldwide. Due to inadequate detection, heterogeneity in tumor formation, chemoresistance, drug resistance, and also manifestation of metastases, the death rate is increasing. Hence, managing of these challenges needs more potent and effective anticancer drugs. The new drug development requires longer time and more cost. Therefore, in the recent technological advancement, search for alternate methods to develop new drugs is a necessary step, which can remove the complex processes, lessen cost, shorten time, and improves success rates. Drug repurposing, computational chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence-assisted approaches are new and novel way of thinking toward the development of anticancer drugs. Drug repurposing with AI can develop a novel effective and specific anticancer drug for the treatment of cancer. The application of AI helps to diagnose the actual cause of cancerous development in the patient and also to determine the doses of effective drugs to be applied for particular cancer. AI together with computational chemistry provides an enhancement to the medical system for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

Prior research suggests that STBs often function as an attempt to escape aversive affect, and that people with BPD experience stronger emotion reactivity and greater discomfort with emotion than those without BPD. Here, we tested whether negative affective states are more likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with BPD than those without this disorder. Data on affective states and suicidal thoughts were collected several times per day from 35 psychiatric inpatients using their smartphones to capture real-time associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. Results revealed that the association between negative affective states (e.g., abandonment, desperation, guilt, hopelessness, loneliness, rage, self-hatred, and upset), and severity of suicidal thinking was stronger among those with BPD than among those without BPD. This finding has implications for risk assessment and intervention in the clinical setting: for a given degree of reported negative affect, patients with BPD experience more suicidal ideation than those without. Further research needs to be done to elucidate the mechanism of this effect.

AB  - ‘Sustainable intensification’ is gaining popularity among academics and donor agencies without much examination of the ambiguities in both terms, made worse by combining them. The terms can be made more serviceable by distinguishing between definitions by extension and definitions by intension. Difficulties with the term ‘intensification’ are addressed by considering the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). This reverses Green Revolution thinking about intensification as a matter of increasing material inputs. Changes in crop management can raise food output by reducing such inputs, with increased reliance on knowledge and management that use available resources more productively and sustainably. Its initial increases in labor inputs are usually transitory. Conjunctions of different disciplines and different levels of analysis and action are considered with reference to the factors of nestedness and contingence. Subjects bearing on sustainable intensification which can benefit from disciplinary convergence include: biogeochemistry to address problems of climate change; part-time farming to adapt to changing economic opportunities; and symbiotic endophytes that can enhance crop health and growth. The concept of ‘causation’ is disaggregated to consider ‘processual’ as distinguished from ‘mechanistic’ causation. Systems thinking is likely to be more productive for addressing interactions within and between subsystems rather than for theorizing about systems as a whole.

AB  - It is widely accepted that the traditional predict-then-act approach to long-term planning for delivery of public services, such as energy, water or transportation, cannot withstand uncertainties and complexities associated with issues such as population growth, changing demands and climate change. In this regard, various planning approaches have been put forward by the scholarship as alternatives to the conventional model. The planning practice, however, is often following the path-dependent legacy of conventional approaches. This study puts forward a planning intervention, which can be plugged into conventional planning processes, as a way of building capacity for alternative planning approaches to take off. The intervention aims at enabling exploratory thinking within the planning process. Exploratory thinking considers alternative perspectives to planning issues, different from the well-established frames of reference, to potentially reveal some of the blind-spots in the business-as-usual planning. Trial application of the proposed intervention within the process of planning for development of a flood management strategy in Melbourne, Australia, provides propitious indications of widening the scope of thinking among the participants. Based on the achieved insights, a methodology for carrying out the proposed intervention is presented. The methodology would be relevant, and potentially useful, for both planning scholars and practitioners.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a future world of interconnected physical objects, with several applications in the areas of smart environments. To implement the IoT concept, the research in the areas of power controlled circuits, embedded systems design, network protocols and control theory should be required. With the much advancement in these areas, the realization of IoT is becoming increasingly probable. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive power control scheme for IoT systems. Based on the cognitive hierarchy thinking mechanism, our proposed scheme is designed as a new behavioral game model to adaptively control the power level. To effectively solve the power control problem in IoT systems, game theory is well-suited and an effective tool. The experimental result illustrates that our game-based approach can get an effective transmission power, which can make the communication rate maximal. Under dynamic IoT system environments, it is highly desirable property.

AB  - This study presents a computational capability for fission product retention and release in two-phase, multi-species systems representing Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) with coupled thermal-hydraulics and fuel coolant chemical behaviours. This is demonstrated through four simulated cases centred on the proposed Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). This is achieved by two-way coupling the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM and the Computational Thermodynamics (CT) code Thermochimica, using the Joint Research Centre Molten Salt Database (JRCMSD). Local chemical equilibrium is assumed, implying that chemical kinetics are predominantly governed by mass transport. Four simulations address normal operating conditions, exploring: (i) dilution of fission products injected within the molten salt coolant, (ii) molten salt coolant evaporation rate, (iii) release of radioactive gaseous species, (iv) shifts in the UF4/UF3 ratio, and (v) comparison of vapour pressures of gaseous species. The influence of temperature-dependent viscosity on retaining fission products, compared to consistent values, is also discussed. The feasibility of integrating CFD with Thermochimica showed promising results, broadening insights into multiphysics systems and setting the stage for its application in more intricate scenarios.

In addition, during the research, whether there is a significant difference between the male and female students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics has been analyzed. The study has been conducted with 300 students studying in the 7th and 8th grades in two private schools in Cankaya, Ankara. In the study “Reflective Thinking Skills towards Problem Solving Scale” (Kızılkaya & Askar, 2009) and “Mathematics Attitude Scale” (Onal, 2013) have been used. In order to determine the levels of students in terms of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation values of the scores obtained via the scales have been calculated and to find out if there is a significant difference between these scores regarding gender, MANOVA has been used. Whether there is a significant difference between the scores of male and female students has been tested by using the scores the students got in total and in the sub-dimensions of the scales. It is found that there does not exist a significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their gender. However, there is a significant difference in favor of the male students in terms of their attitudes towards mathematics. There is a moderate significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics in the positive sense.

AB  - The ability to control unwanted memories is essential for emotional regulation and maintaining mental health. Previous evidence indicates that suppressing retrieval, which recruits executive control mechanisms to prevent unwanted memories entering consciousness, can cause forgetting, termed suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Since these executive mechanisms involve multiple mental operations, we hypothesize that the efficacy of SIF may be limited by individuals’ capacity limitation of cognitive control. Here, we tested this hypothesis. Participants were assigned to two groups based on the median of their cognitive control capacity (CCC, estimated by the backward masking majority function task) and performed the think/no-think task with electrophysiological signals recorded. The results showed that the SIF effect was observed only in the high CCC group but not in the low CCC group. In accordance, repeated suppression attempts also resulted in a steeper reduction in intrusive thoughts in the high CCC group. Furthermore, ERP analysis revealed a decrease in recollection-related late parietal positivity (LPP) under the no-think condition in the high CCC group. A mediation analysis revealed that the reduced intrusive memories mediated the effect of CCC on SIF. These findings suggest that suppressing retrieval could reduce traces of the unwanted memories, making them less intrusive and harder to recall. More importantly, successful SIF is constrained by the capacity of cognitive control which may be used to ensure the coordination of multiple cognitive processes during suppression.

Everyone knows that digital mass-customization is cheaper, faster, smarter, and more environmentally sustainable, than the mechanical mass-production of standardized industrial goods; and everyone knows that the electronic transmission of information is cheaper, faster, smarter, and more environmentally sustainable, than the mechanical transportation of people and goods. Why then are so many neo-Luddite arguments being so vociferously and influentially evoked at all times and in all contexts to the detriment of sheer common sense? In short, why do digital technologies today—in computational design, and in general—have such a bad press?

AB  - Rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) has increased in size and changed in terms of its cellular organisation during primate evolution. In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals’ thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract, often self-generated, thoughts. Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval. Topics for future research will be discussed, such as the role of medial RPFC in processing abstract thoughts in the social domain, the possibility of training abstract thinking in the domain of reasoning, and links to education.

AB  - This paper discusses why conventional project management practices lead to the failure of publicly funded innovation deployment projects, and investigates how the use of systems thinking in project management can help projects be more successful. Based on 12 case studies of two EU innovation policies, we provide evidence that by using systemic project management, which entails providing flexibility in planning, communicating and controlling activities, innovation projects are more successful. This research refutes previous theory that claims that we should formalize to manage complexity and uncertainty. The key finding is that systems thinking methods provide the flexibility to manage innovativeness, complexity and uncertainty in innovation projects more successfully. Suggestions for further research include suggestions of how to embed flexibility in project management methods using the constructs of equifinality and causal embeddedness.

AB  - A central theme of this chapter and of this book is that individuals are smart and this sense rational and can be expected to make smart choices. But these choices typically do not conform the behavioural norms specified by conventional economics for rational behaviour and, therefore, for rational choices. Smart thinking encompasses behaviour that is based on what the individuals deem to be the best path towards achieving their objectives. This behaviour is heavily affected by their decision-making environment as well as their decision-making capabilities, neither of which need be ideal nor fit for purpose. Smart thinking and smart decision-making therefore overlap with the concepts of bounded rationality and satisficing developed by Simon. But smart thinking or broadly rational behaviour might very well appear to be irrational from the prism of conventional economics because they typically don’t conform to conventional behavioural norms for rationality. I also argue, flowing upon Gigerenzer’s fast and frugal heuristics narrative, that adhering to these conventional behavioural norms can result in sub-optimal outcomes from the point of view of the individual decision-maker. Indeed, adopting different behavioural norms and making different choices often yield better outcomes. Being neoclassically rational can actually yield sub-optimal or inefficient outcomes. Ultimately, optimal decision-making norms is context dependent—one size does not fit all. These norms can involve either slow or fast thinking (Kahneman), dependent on circumstance. Also, in the smart thinking narrative errors and biases in decision-making can still take place, but they are correctable through experience and appropriate changes in decision-making capabilities and the decision-making environment. The latter can also correct for any externalities that are often part and parcel of smart or rational decision-making. This chapter also provides a chapter-by-chapter summary of this book.

AB  - Although human thinking is often biased, some individuals are less susceptible to biases than others. These individual differences have been at the forefront of thinking research for more than a decade. We organize the literature in three key accounts (storage, monitoring, and inhibition failure) and propose that a critical but overlooked question concerns the time point at which individual variance arises: do biased and unbiased reasoners take different paths early on in the reasoning process or is the observed variance late to arise? We discuss how this focus on the ‘whens’ suggests that individual differences in thinking biases are less profound than traditionally assumed, in the sense that they might typically arise at a later stage of the reasoning process.

AB  - The present study used the experience sampling method to detect fluctuations in thinking, such as self-focus or concreteness in daily life, and to examine their relationship with depressive symptoms and concurrent negative affect. Thirty-one undergraduates recorded their negative affect, ruminative self-focus, and concreteness of thinking eight times a day for 1week. Multilevel modeling showed that individuals with increasing levels of depression showed lower levels of concreteness in their daily thinking. Further analysis revealed a significant positive association between momentary ruminative self-focus and concurrent negative affect only with low concreteness of thinking. These results suggested that individuals with increasing levels of depression chronically process self-related information on an abstract level, which reflects a malfunction of their self-regulatory cycle and might serve to maintain or even exacerbate dysphoric moods.

AB  - That introspection may impair certain judgments and result in fabrication has been attributed to a distracting shift from more adaptive intuitive processing to more analytic and conscious processing. This phenomenon was studied in an experiment where participants made multidimensional visual choices. It was found that the effect of this shift on decision-making performance was dependent on the quality of the explanations during introspection, while the performance in silent conditions was not. Therefore, it appears that the effect of introspection on judgments is not only influenced by the thinking mode per se, but also by the individual’s ability to approach the decision problem analytically.

AB  - This meta-analysis examined the strength of association between upward counterfactual thinking and depressive symptoms. Forty-two effect sizes from a pooled sample of 13,168 respondents produced a weighted average effect size of r=.26, p<.001. Moderator analyses using an expanded set of 96 effect sizes indicated that upward counterfactuals and regret produced significant positive effects that were similar in strength. Effects also did not vary as a function of the theme of the counterfactual-inducing situation or study design (cross-sectional versus longitudinal). Significant effect size heterogeneity was observed across sample types, methods of assessing upward counterfactual thinking, and types of depression scale. Significant positive effects were found in studies that employed samples of bereaved individuals, older adults, terminally ill patients, or university students, but not adolescent mothers or mixed samples. Both number-based and Likert-based upward counterfactual thinking assessments produced significant positive effects, with the latter generating a larger effect. All depression scales produced significant positive effects, except for the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview. Research and theoretical implications are discussed in relation to cognitive theories of depression and the functional theory of upward counterfactual thinking, and important gaps in the extant research literature are identified.

AB  - We explore the dynamics of entrepreneurial performance and well-being through computational theory. Our model connects mechanisms of work-related motivation and strain processes with the unfolding of an entrepreneurial process. The simulation results show that how an entrepreneur’s energy ebbs and flows over their journey, charting certain venturing performance and levels of well-being, can be linked to distinct interplays of ambition, skill, self-regulation, and dynamism. Our work contributes a holistic account of entrepreneurship and well-being, stimulates computational modelling, and enriches discussions about the entrepreneurial future of work.

AB  - A surprising finding from U.S. opinion surveys is that political disagreements tend to be greatest among the most cognitively sophisticated opposing partisans. Recent experiments suggest a hypothesis that could explain this pattern: cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing of new information. However, the designs of these experiments tend to contain several limitations that complicate their support for this hypothesis. In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.

ABSTRACT
Biologists consider variability during biological investigations. A robust quantitative understanding of variability is particularly important during data analysis, where statistics are used to quantify variation and draw conclusions about phenomena while accounting for variation. Many students struggle to correctly apply a quantitative understanding of variation to statistically analyze data. We present quantitative and qualitative analyses of introductory biology students’ responses on two pairs of multiple-choice questions querying two concepts related to the quantitative analysis of variation. More students correctly identify a mathematical expression of variation than correctly interpret it. Many students correctly interpret a nonsignificant p-value in the context of a very small sample size, but fewer students do so in the context of a large sample size. These results imply that many students have an incomplete quantitative understanding of variation. These findings suggest that instruction focusing on conceptual understanding, not procedural problem solving, may elevate students’ quantitative understanding of variation.

AB  - Students with learning disabilities display a diverse array of factors that interplay with their mathematical understanding. Our aim in this paper is to discuss the extent to which one case study elementary school child with identified learning disabilities (LDs) made sense of composite units and unit fractions. We present analysis and results from multiple sessions conducted during a teaching experiment cast as one-on-one intervention. Results of a multi-phase qualitative analysis reveal two themes evident in the child’s thinking structures across the sessions: (a) Gina’s accommodations over time versus traditional progressions, and (b) Persistent factors that interacted with the child’s reasoning. Throughout the analysis, we raise questions about the child’s reasoning and what the child’s apparent knowing and learning was relying upon. When well-intentioned researchers or educators provide children interventions that promote procedures and replication of teacher-taught strategies, not only are they not serving their children’s mathematics learning needs, they may be preventing them from engaging in, reflecting upon, and coordinating actions that support the children to accommodate their thinking structures and advance their learning. Discussion and implications are shared.

AB  - Human creativity has been claimed to rely on the neurotransmitter dopamine, but evidence is still sparse. We studied whether individual performance (N=117) in divergent thinking (alternative uses task) and convergent thinking (remote association task) can be predicted by the individual spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR), a clinical marker of dopaminergic functioning. EBR predicted flexibility in divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but in different ways. The relationship with flexibility was independent of intelligence and followed an inverted U-shape function with medium EBR being associated with greatest flexibility. Convergent thinking was positively correlated with intelligence but negatively correlated with EBR, suggesting that higher dopamine levels impair convergent thinking. These findings support the claim that creativity and dopamine are related, but they also call for more conceptual differentiation with respect to the processes involved in creative performance.

AB  - Highly metamorphic coal plays a significant role in China's energy development plan owing to its high calorific value. Its complex organic composition provides outstanding storage capabilities for methane (clean and efficient unconventional natural gas), which leads to terrible gas outburst hazards. Minimizing the main storage sites of CH4 (micropores) through organic solvent extraction provides an efficient and safe route for exploiting coal and natural gas energy sources. This phenomenon can be elucidated by the removal of the chemical components that have an adverse impact on the micropore filling theory. In this study, we constructed macromolecular models of highly metamorphic coal, and relative dynamic simulations under experiment and field conditions are performed. The corresponding CH4 storage capacity and spatial coordination distribution of the coal after five treatments were derived. Combined with the results of the micropore filling theory, it was shown that the equilibrium distance of CH4 filling in the micropore increased with the degree of extraction (from 0.351 nm for XT to 0.572 nm for XT-DMF). Also, the trend of CH4 adsorption position in the representative samples (the number of monolayer affixations decreased from 10 to 9) provides crucial support for the conclusions, and the low-potential region with a high potential difference contributes to CH4 stability. The breakthrough of this study will provide strong support and a solid theoretical basis for the efficient and safe exploitation of CBM (Coalbed methane) energy resources.

AB  - Problem solving capabilities have often been reported by teachers as a key benefit from creative coding activities in school-age children. However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements.

This paper presents a methodology for designing compact pipe systems by fully imitating human's imaginal thinking based on image. The feasible workspace is represented as images of the holistic layout of pipes on the basis of human experience. The improved visible graph imitating human pipe-routing behaviour is conducted to form possible edge sequence tree. Moreover, the global optimal pipe path is generated from the tree. The simulation demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipe route design methodology.

AB  - The economic and social outcomes of mining development can be enhanced by positioning local communities central to development activities. Conventional approaches have failed to respond to the needs of the community without this involvement in decision making. Accordingly, novel development approaches for community involvement and sustainability have to recognize the complex nature of social systems in which mining sector exists. The objective of this paper is to develop a community-centered approach by integrating rapid and participatory nature of design thinking with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to support sustainable development. While design thinking engages multiple stakeholders for generating alternatives, MCDA provides metrics for assessing these alternatives. Drawing on an example from a small scale mining development in Central America, this paper shows that early community involvement and rigorous impact assessment on a regular basis motivate community involvement and give value to the social outcome of mining development.

AB  - Algebraic thinking addresses general mathematical relationships, expressing them in increasingly sophisticated ways as activities move from seeing patterns in number, geometry and measurement to determining solutions to more and more complex problems. This paper reports on an ongoing research project investigating how working on, representing and solving structurally related problems in a variety of ways prepares students to think algebraically as they articulate and generalise their solution processes. Examples of problems and their solutions by students in a Year 7 primary classroom will be presented and analysed to highlight how a deeper investigation of mathematical problems can instigate student discourse that encourages general ways of thinking underpinning algebraic reasoning rather than simply using particular strategies or procedures for classes of problems. The results obtained so far suggest that students are able to build general ways of thinking that will lead them to an algebraic perspective of mathematics beyond the mechanics and procedures often associated with algebra. Not only will this build confidence in ways of operating that are their own, such a development also parallels the historical development of algebra itself.

AB  - The world is becoming increasingly automated, and the ability to deal with technologies is seen as important in society and working life. Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field. Finally, a 1:1:1 -model for realising research-based suggestions in PD programmes is presented.

AB  - Individuals who experience recurrent negative thoughts are at elevated risk for mood and anxiety disorders. It is thus essential to understand why some individuals get stuck in recurrent negative thinking (RNT), whereas others are able to disengage eventually. Theoretical models propose that individuals high in recurrent negative thinking suffer from deficits in controlling the contents of working memory. Empirical findings, however, are inconclusive. In this meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 94 studies to examine the proposed association between RNT and deficits in cognitive control. We included numerous effect sizes not reported in the primary publications. Moderator analyses tested the influence of variables, such as stimuli valence, cognitive control function (e.g., shifting, discarding), or type of RNT (i.e., rumination or worry). Results demonstrated an association between repetitive negative thinking and deficits in only one specific cognitive control function, namely difficulty discarding no longer relevant material from working memory (r = −0.20). This association remained significant after controlling for level of psychopathology. There was no substantial association between RNT and deficits in any other cognitive control function. All other moderators were not significant. We discuss limitations (e.g., primary sample sizes, reliability of paradigms) and highlight implications for future research and clinical interventions.

AB  - The present research is intended to find out whether individuals with analytic or holistic thought have different attribution processes. Cross-cultural research has suggested that East Asians, who tend to have a holistic thought pattern, differ in cognitive process from Westerners, who tend to engage in analytic thought. However, studies that found cultural difference in attribution process may have non-equivalence problems that make it hard to interpret the causal relationship between thinking style and attribution process. The present research extends this by measuring participants’ thinking style within a single culture in order to ensure equivalence on potentially confounding variables such as prior knowledge and cognitive capacity. Two experiments demonstrate that both types of thinkers have identical attribution processes and suggest different thinking styles might relate to different tendencies toward situational information, but not to the attribution process itself.

We found that students in higher grades were more likely than those in lower grades to pose problems that involved functional relationships in both posing task situations. A posed problem involves a functional relationship when a mathematical function is the basis of the problem. We also found a mismatch between the problems that the students generated and those that their teachers predicted they would pose. Compared to the actual problems posed by the students, the problems predicted by the teachers were more likely to involve functional relationships about the pattern and less likely to involve a particular term in the pattern. Moreover, at the higher grades, the mathematical thinking related to problem posing predicted by the teachers was of a higher order than was evidenced by the problems posed by the students. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.

AB  - Systems thinking is thought to facilitate complex decision-making, but relatively little is known about its psychological underpinning. We present three studies that situate a measure of the construct in relation to other dispositional measures that have received more attention in environmental psychology and by testing whether the mindset predicts behavior in a set of novel decision making tasks. In Study 1, we find that systems thinkers tend to believe in scientific consensus, recognize risks posed by climate change, and support policy interventions to address climate change; systems thinking was negatively related to conspiracist and free-market ideation. In Studies 2 and 3 we find that systems thinkers ascribe more value to the natural world — both in monetary terms as well as on social and ecological grounds. The findings suggest that models of environmental cognition can be improved by measuring peoples' tendency to engage in systems thinking.

AB  - The mechanisms of psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions are often investigated in fully-formed illness, well after symptoms emerge. These investigations have yielded key insights, but are not well-positioned to reveal the dynamic forces underlying symptom formation itself. Understanding symptom development over time would allow us to identify steps in the pathophysiological process leading to psychosis, shifting the focus of psychiatric intervention from symptom alleviation to prevention. We propose a model for understanding the emergence of psychotic symptoms within the context of an adaptive, developing neural system. We will make the case for a pathophysiological process that begins with cortical hyperexcitability and bottom-up noise transmission, which engenders inappropriate belief formation via aberrant prediction error signaling. We will argue that this bottom-up noise drives learning about the (im)precision of new incoming sensory information because of diminished signal-to-noise ratio, causing a compensatory relative over-reliance on prior beliefs. This over-reliance on priors predisposes to hallucinations and covaries with hallucination severity. An over-reliance on priors may also lead to increased conviction in the beliefs generated by bottom-up noise and drive movement toward conversion to psychosis. We will identify predictions of our model at each stage, examine evidence to support or refute those predictions, and propose experiments that could falsify or help select between alternative elements of the overall model. Nesting computational abnormalities within longitudinal development allows us to account for hidden dynamics among the mechanisms driving symptom formation and to view established symptomatology as a point of equilibrium among competing biological forces.

AB  - Divergent thinking, as a method of examining creative cognition, has not been adequately analyzed in the context of modern cognitive theories. This article casts divergent thinking responding in the context of theories of memory search. First, it was argued that divergent thinking tasks are similar to semantic fluency tasks, but are more constrained, and less well structured. Next, response time distributions from 54 participants were analyzed for temporal and semantic clustering. Participants responded to two prompts from the alternative uses test: uses for a brick and uses for a bottle, for two minutes each. Participants’ cumulative response curves were negatively accelerating, in line with theories of search of associative memory. However, results of analyses of semantic and temporal clustering suggested that clustering is less evident in alternative uses responding compared to semantic fluency tasks. This suggests either that divergent thinking responding does not involve an exhaustive search through a clustered memory trace, but rather that the process is more exploratory, yielding fewer overall responses that tend to drift away from close associates of the divergent thinking prompt.

AB  - This study examines the potential for music education to enhance children's mathematical thinking. Specification of potential cognitive correlates between musical and mathematical components is sought and underpins the design (3 variables x 2 conditions each=6 groups). Nearly 200 children aged 7-8 years experienced weekly music lessons (duration=9 months). Lessons emphasized melody, rhythm or form; in half of the classes, the teacher made the musical-mathematical parallels explicit. Apart from the specific musical-mathematical foci, the lesson content was kept as constant as possible within primary school settings. Pre-tests and post-tests in musical, creative, spatial and mathematical thinking were administered. Statistical analyses will examine improvement over time while considering differences among three musical components and two conditions for each. This research addresses concerns that governments’ quests for higher standards in mathematics may result in impoverished curricula with limited access to the arts. If it is shown that musical training appears to benefit logical thinking, as hypothesized, it may add to a growing body of research suggesting that policy-makers and educationalists reconsider curriculum balance.

AB  - Many higher education institutions have started to develop academic curricula, research capacity and outreach activities related to circular economy. However, little is known yet on how to apply circular economy thinking to sustainable campus management. In an attempt to address this gap, this paper proposes a methodological framework and guidance to help universities develop a circular economy strategy aimed at improving resource efficiency and environmental sustainability of their campus operations. The approach is compatible with sustainability management frameworks as it follows the well-known iterative process of planning, doing, checking and improving. The framework involves three main steps: analysis of current situation with respect to circular economy within the organisation; stakeholder engagement to get a buy-in and inform the development of a circular economy strategy; and implementation of the strategy following the guidelines provided within the framework. Application of the framework is illustrated through a case of the University of Manchester, demonstrating how circular economy principles can be used to benchmark existing sustainability policies and action plans. The paper also shows how engaging key stakeholders can be used to identify challenges and opportunities for embedding circular economy thinking into the university's sustainability management systems. The proposed framework and the guidelines for implementation of circular economy thinking are generic and can be applied by any institution across the higher education sector.

AB  - The theories of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and fuzzy logic both aim to model human thinking. In MCDM, aggregation processes and preference modeling play the central role. This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.

There are also gaps in the understanding of how young children manifest CT. With this paper, we contribute to the field by taking an action perspective with the CT of K-3 students. The analysis focus on iterative acts of abstraction and decomposition as a core process that elicits development of CT. We call these iterative acts the Abstraction/Decomposition spiral (AD spiral). By illustrating the AD spiral through the actions of two first grade students, the analysis shows how visual representation of an emerging solution, and the development of a plan are two important elements when young students solve problems in a coding context, developing their CT.

AB  - The paper considers the approach to solving the problem of preventing the information system vulnerability that arises due to the insertion and / or performance of a semantically incorrect script (XSS-vulnerability). The solution of this task suggests modelling the information exchange between active objects. Modelling is supposed to be carried out within the framework of the basic applicative computing system, in which the code fragments can be modelled by applicative objects. An important part of the task is to check the correctness of the scenarios composition, which requires the tools make compositional thinking about data flows, both when they are processed by scripts and contain them. The correctness is proposed to be provided by supporting the fairly strong typing system that excludes incorrect combinations of scenarios. The type system is assumed to be immersed into the applicative environment. The system is proposed to be built on the basis of the homotopy type theory, which ensures, in particular, the introduction of independent and dependent types, as well as the definition of recursion and induction principles for them. Partial approbation of typing constructions is performed with the example of the problem of semantic support for the implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).

AB  - Performing two tasks concurrently is difficult, which has been taken to imply the existence of a structural processing bottleneck. Here we sought to assess whether and to what degree one’s multitasking abilities depend on the cognitive-control style one engages in. Participants were primed with creativity tasks that either called for divergent thinking—which were suspected to induce a holistic, flexible task processing mode, or convergent thinking—which were assumed to induce a systematic, focused processing mode. Participants showed reduced cross-talk between tasks and increased task-component switching costs (dual-task costs) for the convergent-thinking group compared to both, a divergent-thinking group and a neutral control group. The results suggest that the cognitive-control style people engage in prior to the task predicts their multitasking performance.

The most common ways of selecting a new employee is mostly based on several interviews, theorical and practical tests, forms and group dynamics, in the expectation that the data provided by the candidates will be the starting point for a great selection, but, in most cases, the selection is made in a way that do not use some logical think, just the empirical thinking, liable to make unjust selections or that do not meet expectations properly. Based on this fact, the objective of this work is to report the use of the multicriteria method to support decision making AHP-TOPSIS-2N through the web software Three Decision Methods to support the choice of intern for the IoT-Based startup "Riverdata". After interviews with the chosen one, it was noticed that the results were satisfactory and met the expectations of those responsible for the selection.

AB  - Smart devices in Industry 5.0, such as sensors and robots, are often limited by low battery life and finite computational resources, hindering their ability to perform complex tasks. By offloading computation-intensive tasks to Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MEC) servers at the network’s edge, businesses can achieve real-time data processing and analysis, reducing communication latency, quicker response times, and improved system reliability. This work presents an integrated framework for MEC and Industry 5.0, aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and flexibility of industrial processes. In particular, we propose a joint optimization problem that maximizes computational energy efficiency by optimally allocating resources, such as processing power and computational resources, as well as device association, in the most efficient manner possible. The problem is formulated as nonconvex/nonlinear, which is intractable and poses high complexity. To solve this challenging problem, we first transform and decouple the original optimization problem into a series of subproblems using the block coordinate descent method. Then, we iteratively obtain an efficient solution using convex optimization methods. In addition, our work sheds light on the fundamental trade-off between local computation and partial offloading schemes. The results show that for small data size requirements, the performance is comparable among different schemes. However, as data size increases, our proposed hybrid scheme, which includes a partial offloading scheme, outperforms others, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization scheme.

We found that the scaffolds differentially supported their practice and suggest strategic improvement of the focus and organization of different types of scaffolds. Findings from the study contribute to the conceptualization and design of scaffolds for practice-based learning opportunities in teacher education.

Then, a two-stage approach based on a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm entwined with optimization-embedding offloading ratio is proposed to enhance server selection for load balancing. Numeral results demonstrate that, with reference to a workshop-scale scenario, the proposed method can achieve outperformed performance in reducing delay and balancing loads on edge servers than the other four baseline schemes.

Thereby, we need to understand, measure, and assess the structure and functioning of the urban processes. We propose an innovative and novel evidence-based methodology to manage the complexity of urban processes, that can enhance their resilience as part of the concept of smart and regenerative urban metabolism with the overarching intention to better achieve sustainability. We couple Life Cycle Thinking and Machine Learning to measure and assess the metabolic processes of the urban core of Lisbon's functional urban area using multidimensional indicators and measures incorporating urban ecosystem services dynamics. We built and trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to identify the metabolic drivers and predict the metabolic changes for the near future (2025). The prediction model's performance was validated using the standard deviations of the prediction errors of the data subsets and the network's training graph. The simulated results show that the urban processes related to employment and unemployment rates (17%), energy systems (10%), sewage and waste management/treatment/recycling, demography & migration, hard/soft cultural assets, and air pollution (7%), education and training, welfare, cultural participation, and habitat-ecosystems (5%), urban safety, water systems, economy, housing quality, urban void, urban fabric, and health services and infrastructure (2%), consists the salient drivers for the urban metabolic changes. The proposed research framework acts as a knowledge-based tool to support effective urban metabolism policies ensuring sustainable and resilient urban development.

AB  - Loopholes offer an opening. Rather than comply or directly refuse, people can subvert an intended request by an intentional misunderstanding. Such behaviors exploit ambiguity and under-specification in language. Using loopholes is commonplace and intuitive in everyday social interaction, both familiar and consequential. Loopholes are also of concern in the law, and increasingly in artificial intelligence. However, the computational and cognitive underpinnings of loopholes are not well understood. Here, we propose a utility-theoretic recursive social reasoning model that formalizes and accounts for loophole behavior. The model captures the decision process of a loophole-aware listener, who trades off their own utility with that of the speaker, and considers an expected social penalty for non-cooperative behavior. The social penalty is computed through the listener’s recursive reasoning about a virtual naive observer’s inference of a naive listener’s social intent. Our model captures qualitative patterns in previous data, and also generates new quantitative predictions consistent with novel studies (N = 265). We consider the broader implications of our model for other aspects of social reasoning, including plausible deniability and humor.

AB  - Decades of reasoning and decision-making research have established that human judgment is often biased by intuitive heuristics. Although this heuristic bias is well documented and widely featured in psychology textbooks, its precise nature is less clear. A key question is whether reasoners detect the biased nature of their judgments. My research is focusing on this detection process. In a nutshell, results indicate that despite their illogical response, people demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity to possible conflict between their heuristic judgment and elementary logical or probabilistic principles. In this chapter, I present a detailed overview of the empirical studies that I have run and discuss theoretical implications. I will clarify why the empirical detection findings have led me to hypothesize that people not only have heuristic intuitions but also logical intuitions. I also explore implications for ongoing debates concerning our view of human rationality (“Are humans blind and ignorant heuristic thinkers?”), dual process theories of reasoning (“How do intuitive and deliberate thinking interact?”), and the nature of individual differences in bias susceptibility (“when and why do biased and unbiased reasoners start to diverge?”).

AB  - As technologies advance and replace human labor in a variety of settings, we focus our attention on human creativity for generating new ideas. Business organizations, more than ever, recognize that they need employees who think creatively to maintain their competitive edge. Nonetheless, there is a lack of research assessing new ideas and influential factors in generating innovative ideas. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence the creation of innovative ideas. We conducted two different types of workshops with 22 subjects and 23 subjects each. In the first workshop, subjects were asked to generate new business ideas through analogical thinking. As a result, half of the participants generated appropriate ideas, and three influential factors were determined: categorization skill, deliberation, and trial and error. The second workshop was designed to facilitate participants to enhance these three factors. As a result, 70% of the participants could generate appropriate ideas. By identifying influential factors, this paper suggests a procedure for designing an innovation workshop that enables the creation of appropriate ideas.

AB  - Kindergarten Social Assistive Robot (KindSAR) is an innovative tool promotes children’s development through social interaction. This pilot study demonstrates how KindSAR can assist educational staff in the teaching of geometric thinking and in promoting the metacognitive development by engaging children in interactive play activities. Children’s reactions and performances were video recorded for analysis. Most children exhibited positive interaction with the robot and a high level of enjoyment. Our results showed that their performances on geometric thinking and metacognitive tasks were improved while they “played” with the robot. To measure children’s learning we have developed a novel measure of cognitive learning, which we call “velocity of learning”. This study demonstrates the feasibility and expected benefits of incorporating KindSAR in preschool education.

AB  - Many studies try to explain thought processes based on verbal data alone and often take the linguistic variation between languages as evidence for cross-linguistic thought processes during speaking. We argue that looking at co-speech gestures might broaden the scope and shed new light on different thinking-for-speaking patterns. Data comes from a corpus study investigating the relationship between speech and gesture in two typologically different languages: Danish, a satellite-framed language and Italian, a verb-framed language. Results show cross-linguistic variation in how motion components are mapped onto linguistic constituents, but also show how Italian speakers to some degree deviate from standard verb-framed lexicalization patterns, and use typical satellite-framed constructions. Co-speech gestures, when they occur, largely follow the patterns used in speech, with a notable exception: In 28% of the cases, in fact, Italian speakers express manner in path-only speech constructions gesturally. This finding suggests that gestures may be instrumental in revealing what semantic components speakers attend to while speaking; in other words, purely verbal data may not fully account for the thinking part of the thinking-for-speaking hypothesis.

AB  - Although many efforts have been made to explore the genetic basis of divergent thinking (DT), there is still a gap in the understanding of how these findings relate to the neurobiology of DT. In a combined sample of 1,682 Chinese participants, by integrating GWAS with previously identified brain-specific gene co-expression network modules, this study explored for the first time the functional brain-specific gene co-expression networks underlying DT. The results showed that gene co-expression network modules in anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, amygdala and substantia nigra were enriched with DT association signals. Further functional enrichment analysis showed that these DT-related gene co-expression network modules were enriched for key biological process and cellular component related to myelination, suggesting that cortical and sub-cortical grey matter myelination may serve as important neurobiological basis of DT. Although the underlying mechanisms need to be further refined, this exploratory study may provide new insight into the neurobiology of DT.

AB  - Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and executive functioning (EF) deficits are each characteristic of many forms of youth psychopathology. Extensive work has examined the relationship between rumination, a form of RNT, and EF in adults. However, less is known about the relationship between RNT more broadly and EF in youth, for whom these constructs are developing and emerging. Here, we systematically and qualitatively reviewed 27 studies on the associations between EF (e.g., shifting, inhibition, working memory) and RNT (e.g., rumination, worry, obsessions) in youth. All forms of RNT were more commonly positively associated with questionnaire-reported EF problems in daily life, most frequently in the domain of shifting. Task-based assessments of EF were less consistently associated with RNT in youth, with no strong pattern of presence vs. absence of associations. Further, limited longitudinal work has been conducted on this topic to date. This review integrates initial work with regard to RNT and EF deficits in a still-developing population, and discusses clear future need for longitudinal, multi-method assessments of the relationship between RNT and EF subtypes in youth.

AB  - Although there have been many educational programs focusing on the creation of new ideas, the assessment of novelty is still a controversial issue. As an ideation tool, analogical thinking enables conceptual change, which is seen as a crucial aspect of creativity. In this regard, the use of analogy can be an important instrument to facilitate novel idea generation. Analogies are generated by superficial or structural similarities from the memory. For creating a new idea by analogy, this study regards novelty as the domain-changing influenced by structural consistency with the source ideas. Consequently, we designed an assessment framework based on the latent semantic analysis of the domains and the consistency of the underlying mechanism between the source and the new ideas. Data was collected from the 14 subjects who participated in the workshop for this study. The workshop consists of three tasks: 1) Pre-task: All subjects were asked to read the 25 cases of the collective intelligence services, which is a business model creating value from large and loosely organized groups of people working together electronically e.g. Amazon.com, Google Japanese input; 2) Categorization task: Subjects were asked to categorize each case based on the underlying mechanism of the business through group discussion; 3) Generation task: Subjects were asked to create a new service idea individually using analogical thinking. As a result, 12 ideas were created, 6 of which were assessed as novel according to our assessment framework. Among the remaining 6 ideas, 4 were assessed as having high superficial similarity in terms of the idea domain, and 2 as having neither superficial nor structural similarity with the source ideas. Although our findings suggest that the proposed assessment framework for novelty evaluation is unable to provide a ‘one-size fits-all method’, it does enable us to overcome some of the limitations of current evaluation methods which depend on subjective judgements for rating.

AB  - This paper presents a review of computational toys and kits that enable young children (ages 7 years old and under) to explore computational ideas and practices. We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.

AB  - Hillslopes are the fundamental building blocks of catchments, however, fully disentangling their hydrological response remains an outstanding challenge. In natural settings, hillslope hydrology is challenged by the interplay of several factors, such as, heterogeneous morphology, vegetation, and complex soils. Herein, we attempt to clarify the mechanisms that control the rainfall-runoff relationship by investigating the response of an artificial outdoor slope setup with uniform geometry, soil properties, topography, and in the absence of vegetation located in a Mediterranean climate. Based on the analysis of more than 100 storms across six consecutive hydrological years, our results demonstrate that either pre-event soil water content or rainfall conditions alone are not sufficient to explain the slope response. Seasonality played a major role through soil moisture conditions, and pre-event soil moisture, peak rainfall intensity and rainfall duration influenced the slope runoff response. Observations suggest that in fall and winter subsurface flow was the prevalent runoff mechanism, while infiltration excess overland flow mostly occurred in the dry season. Our findings show that continuous measurement of runoff could be beneficial to understand the peak rainfall-peak runoff relationship.

AB  - The purpose of this report is to examine relations between extreme thinking, as measured by the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, and the maintenance of gains among adolescents who participated in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS). We examine extreme thinking among 327 adolescents (mean age=14.56, 57% female, 75% White) who received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine (FLX), or a combination of CBT and FLX (COMB). Among those who met remission status on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R≤28; 56 at week 12, 79 at week 18) extreme thinking did not predict failure to maintain remission. This is in contrast to findings with depressed adults. Treatment influenced level of extreme thinking, and this appeared to be driven by greater endorsement of positively valenced beliefs as opposed to a decrease in negatively valenced beliefs. Developmental or investigation characteristics may account for the discrepancy in findings.

AB  - In recent years, the relationship between geographic information science (GIScience) and spatial thinking has attracted much attention in English-speaking countries. Nevertheless, vagueness remains concerning the concept of spatial thinking and its components. The aim of this paper is to review previous studies on the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking, and to clarify the elements of spatial thinking and related terms. After discussing the basic elements of spatial thinking, it explores the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking by dividing it into two aspects: the role of geographic information systems (GIS) in education on spatial thinking, and the role of spatial thinking in GIScience. Concerning the former, potential roles of GIS in spatial thinking education, particularly in geography and STEM disciplines, are suggested. Concerning the latter, the relationships between the body of knowledge on GIS education and the elements of spatial thinking are examined. Finally, the present situation and future prospects for studies on spatial thinking and GIScience in Japan are briefly discussed.

AB  - Humans often pursue idiosyncratic goals that appear remote from functional ends, including information gain. We suggest that this is valuable because goals (even prima facie foolish or unachievable ones) contain structured information that scaffolds thinking and planning. By evaluating hypotheses and plans with respect to their goals, humans can discover new ideas that go beyond prior knowledge and observable evidence. These hypotheses and plans can be transmitted independently of their original motivations, adapted across generations, and serve as an engine of cultural evolution. Here, we review recent empirical and computational research underlying goal generation and planning and discuss the ways that the flexibility of our motivational system supports cognitive gains for both individuals and societies.

AB  - Culture and creative production have an important but somewhat elusive role in urban development. None of the many conceptual paradigms that have been proposed so far to explain it has turned out entirely satisfactory. We argue that the main reason behind this failure is the implicit linear thinking that informs all these approaches: namely, the idea that a few, major drivers explain urban development through a direct, clearly readable systemic impact. Cities are complex socio-environmental systems whose functioning depends on the concurrent interaction of many different factors which cannot be reduced to the action of a few, simple causal forces. Failing to understand such complexity easily leads to dysfunctional urban governance approaches. In this paper, we analyze a database of 144 European cities as described by 58 variables belonging to different domains, as designed by a preliminary stage of the Cultural and Creative City Monitor (CCCM). Our analysis builds on innovative machine learning techniques (PST) and on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) representation to map the structural interdependencies between the cultural and non-cultural sectors in cities with a strong cultural policy orientation. This toolbox carries considerable potential for precision cultural policies and data-driven urban governance strategies of the future.

AB  - There exists a large body of literature seeking to understand the relation between math anxiety and success in mathematics. While most of this literature focuses on domain specific relations (i.e., how math anxiety impacts thinking about mathematics), in the current work we examine important relations between math anxiety and domain general factors. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: (1) that higher-math-anxious individuals have a lower need for and enjoyment of exerting cognitive effort, (2) that math anxiety mediates a relation between ones’ propensity for cognitive effort and their achievement in mathematics, and (3) that higher-math-anxious individuals are less reflective in their thinking, and that this is not limited to questions that are heavily reliant on mathematical reasoning. As predicted, we uncovered relations between math anxiety and the domain-general constructs of need for cognition and cognitive reflection. Importantly, these negative relations hold even after controlling for math ability, general anxiety, and gender of the participant. The results are discussed in terms of implications for our understanding of the construct of math anxiety. Proficiency in mathematics is a major advantage in industrialised nations. Unfortunately, many people experience math-anxiety (Richardson & Suinn, 1972), becoming nervous when engaging in math tasks and avoiding math and math-related professions. As a result, those with math anxiety tend to severely limit their future career and earning opportunities (Chipman, Krantz, & Silver, 1992; Hembree, 1990). The resulting shortage of adults prepared to work in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (STEM) has negative consequences at the national level, particularity as societies become increasingly dependent upon technology (Beilock & Maloney, 2015; Chipman et al., 1992; Maloney & Beilock, 2012). Worldwide, increased math-anxiety is linked to decreased math achievement (Foley et al., 2017; Lee, 2009), and this is not limited to academic situations. Math-anxious nurses, for example, are more likely than non-math-anxious nurses to make poor drug calculations (Mcmullan, Jones, & Lea, 2012); math-anxious women are more likely than their peers to engage in poor financial planning (McKenna & Nickols, 1988), and math anxiety is negatively linked to the ability to interpret health statistics (Silk & Parrott, 2014). Given that math-anxiety is related to important and detrimental consequences in people’s daily lives, it is vital that we work to understand the behavioural and cognitive differences between those who are high and low in math-anxiety.

AB  - The recent literature on reasoning biases in psychosis and delusions is reviewed. The state-of-the-art knowledge from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the evidence for jumping to conclusions is briefly summarised, before a fuller discussion of the more recent empirical literature on belief flexibility as applied to delusions. The methodology and evidence in relation to studies of belief flexibility and the Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence (BADE) across the delusional continuum will be critically appraised, and implications drawn for improving cognitive therapy. It will be proposed that dual process models of reasoning, which Kahneman (Kahneman, 2011) popularised as ‘fast and slow thinking’, provide a useful theoretical framework for integrating further research and informing clinical practice. The emergence of therapies which specifically target fast and slow thinking in people with distressing delusions will be described.

AB  - In this paper we build on a conceptual framing of computational empowerment that seeks to provide alternative endpoints for computer science (CS) education beyond degree attainment and job placement. But, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist.

AB  - While the study of global governance is moving from a focus on component-dominated to interaction-dominated systems, the present paper reviews development in governance theories from a complexity perspective and discuss how governance systems can be represented in terms of multi-layered networks. Such representation is useful to foster interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers working in global governance/international relations and data science/computational science. The combination of a data-driven approach with computational modelling paves the way to both contribute to a more fundamental understanding of how multilateral governance systems work and to address some important contemporary questions about institutional complexity and the effectiveness of governance design.

Mathematical thinking is an important method to support students in the learning of calculus and specifically multivariable calculus. Researchers endeavour to support student's mathematical thinking in calculus with or without computer-based tools. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using computer-based tools for fostering student's mathematical thinking to overcome their obstacles in multivariable calculus.

AB  - The energy sector has suffered a significant restructuring that has increased the complexity in electricity market players' interactions. The complexity that these changes brought requires the creation of decision support tools to facilitate the study and understanding of these markets. The Multiagent Simulator of Competitive Electricity Markets (MASCEM) arose in this context, providing a simulation framework for deregulated electricity markets. The Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System (ALBidS) is a multiagent system created to provide decision support to market negotiating players. Fully integrated with MASCEM, ALBidS considers several different strategic methodologies based on highly distinct approaches. Six Thinking Hats (STH) is a powerful technique used to look at decisions from different perspectives, forcing the thinker to move outside its usual way of thinking. This paper aims to complement the ALBidS strategies by combining them and taking advantage of their different perspectives through the use of the STH group decision technique. The combination of ALBidS' strategies is performed through the application of a genetic algorithm, resulting in an evolutionary learning approach.

AB  - Scenario planning methods tend to work at an aggregate level and to consider homogeneous populations, thus levelling the variable effects of future developments on different social groups. Decision-making based on such scenarios bears the risk of missing undesired impacts on specific groups of people, which may cause social tensions or require costly countermeasures. New approaches are needed to provide a better basis for socially responsible planning by making clearer the complex social impacts of future scenarios. In marketing and user-centered design, persona models are developed to represent typologies of users to cover a broad range of needs and requirements. We propose a systematic method, called the Scenario Personarrative method, for combining scenario thinking and personas into a structured but nonetheless flexible process, which allows generating fine-grained individualized narratives. We describe a pilot application in a case study on urban mobility. This pilot used existing scenarios and focused on a two-hour workshop where twelve experts created personas and the associated narratives across three scenarios of urban mobility in 2030. This pilot shows the applicability of the method for making potential effects on different social groups more tangible. We propose ways forward for further evaluation of the proposed methodology.

AB  - This study examined the effects of two pre-determined accommodations that were provided in a standardized testing. The two accommodations were meant to help students with difficulties in mathematics (SDMs) engage in unit thinking, reasoning, and coordination and consequently improve their ability to process fraction tasks. 23 middle school SDMs took the following tests and were asked to explain their solutions: a baseline fraction test without any accommodation; an annotated test with bolded information and additional simplified explanations; and a warming- up test that involved whole-number multiplicative reasoning tasks followed by the baseline test. Results show that while SDMs were able to construct and coordinate fraction units to solve fraction problems when appropriate accommodations were provided, standardized assessment with a predetermined “one-size-fits -all” accommodation could not meet the specific needs of all students with mathematics learning difficulties.

AB  - Charles S. Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science, which leads to the info-computational view of nature, mind and culture. However, this theory lacks a phenomenological foundation. David Chalmers' double aspect interpretation of information attempts to overcome the limitations of the info-computational view. Chalmers supplements Batesonian and Wheelerian info-computationalism – both of which lack a phenomenological aspect - with a dimension that corresponds to the phenomenological aspect of reality. However, he does not manage to produce an integrated theory of the development of meaning and rationality. Alex Hankey's further work goes some way towards establishing a theory that can satisfy Husserl's criteria for consciousness - such as a sense of being and time - but Hankey's dependence on Chalmers' theory is still not able to account for what the connection between core consciousness and the physical world is.

AB  - This paper reports on an aspect of the EC funded Argunaut project which researched and developed awareness tools for moderators of online dialogues. In this study we report on an investigation into the nature of creative thinking in online dialogues and whether or not this creative thinking can be coded for and recognized automatically such that moderators can be alerted when creative thinking is occurring or when it has not occurred after a period of time. We outline a dialogic theory of creativity, as the emergence of new perspectives from the interplay of voices, and the testing of this theory using a range of methods including a coding scheme which combined coding for creative thinking with more established codes for critical thinking, artificial intelligence pattern-matching techniques to see if our codes could be read automatically from maps and ‘key event recall’ interviews to explore the experience of participants. Our findings are that: (1) the emergence of new perspectives in a graphical dialogue map can be recognized by our coding scheme supported by a machine pattern-matching algorithm in a way that can be used to provide awareness indicators for moderators; (2) that the trigger events leading to the emergence of new perspectives in the online dialogues studied were most commonly disagreements and (3) the spatial representation of messages in a graphically mediated synchronous dialogue environment such as Digalo may offer more affordance for creativity than the much more common scrolling text chat environments. All these findings support the usefulness of our new account of creativity in online dialogues based on dialogic theory and demonstrate that this account can be operationalised through machine coding in a way that can be turned into alerts for moderators.

AB  - Analysis of the impact of interaction and experience on quality components such as “usability”, “producibility”, “reliability”, “sustainability” and “aesthetics” is presented using the case of engineering design, a discipline that traditionally has an image of being a strictly calculated, rigid framework. It has been widely recognised that engineering design encompasses two ways of thinking—creative and critical. A central argument that the synergy of creativity and criticality is significantly enhanced by connecting true interdisciplinary augmentation with the fine arts is discussed along with reflecting on the importance of such an approach in higher education.
