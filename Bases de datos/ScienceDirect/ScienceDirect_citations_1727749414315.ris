AB  - In this paper, the reaction mechanism of system feedback on the changes of external environmental parameters has been discussed. And the conclusions have been attributed to the assimilation rule. According to the research results of the circuit system, assimilated factors should be defined at first--- the parts which have been isolated from the system equivalent parameters and the external parameters have been also contained. Afterwards, the analog inductive method has been adopted to conduct the overall feasibility study for the establishment of the rules. Then, several new ideas have been also provided in accordance with the applications of assimilation rules in the fields of biology, cognitive science and social organizations, etc. Finally, the block diagram has been provided so as to give a comprehensive overview for the thinking ideas of system.

AB  - Bacillus licheniformis 2709 is the major alkaline protease producer, which has great potential value of industrial application, but how the high-producer can be regulated rationally is still not completely understood. It's meaningful to understand the metabolic processes during alkaline protease production in industrial fermentation medium. Here, we collected the transcription database at various enzyme-producing stages (preliminary stage, stable phase and decline phase) to specifically research the synthesized and regulatory mechanism of alkaline protease in B. licheniformis. The RNA-sequencing analysis showed differential expression of numerous genes related to several processes, among which genes correlated with regulators were concerned, especially the major differential gene abrB on enzyme (AprE) synthesis was investigated. It was further verified that AbrB is a repressor of AprE by plasmid-mediated over-expression due to the severely descending enzyme activity (11,300 U/mL to 2695 U/mL), but interestingly it is indispensable for alkaline protease production because the enzyme activity of the null abrB mutant was just about 2279 U/mL. Thus, we investigated the aprE transcription by eliminating the theoretical binding site (TGGAA) of AbrB protein predicated by computational strategy, which significantly improved the enzyme activity by 1.21-fold and gene transcription level by 1.77-fold in the mid-log phase at a cultivation time of 18 h. Taken together, it is of great significance to improve the production strategy, control the metabolic process and oriented engineering by rational molecular modification of regulatory network based on the high throughput sequencing and computational prediction.

AB  - In this article a maturity model for the management of transdisciplinary knowledge is presented, although research nowadays is transdisciplinary the different maturity models proposed in the literature are oriented towards interdisciplinary knowledge management, and, at most, they are oriented toward multidisciplinary knowledge management. The objective is proposing an evolutionary model which accepts knowledge as intensely active and dynamic and evolving in maturity from the early stages of research. But this is possible only if the research team adopt a clear, clean and joint process of disciplinary integration and transdisciplinary integration of the produced and discovered knowledge. In this way, the results of research will have a greater influence on society and they also will be adopted by society.

AB  - We present a process that revisits form-finding within digital media, namely parametric design and robotic fabrication. It is inspired by classical architectural and engineering experiments producing minimal surfaces and tensile structures by physical simulation of materials and natural forces. Fabrication is based on thermoforming, where thin sheets of amorphous PET are heat-treated and while in malleable state, where the material behaves like stretchable membrane, an industrial robot imprints a shape and sheets are rapidly cooled down assuming their final form. Key aspects of the approach include: (a) Speed: as each sheet is formed within seconds; (b) Flexibility, as a wide-range of shapes are produced without fabrication of unique dies; and (c) Resilience, as unlike traditional form-finding processes where the derived forms are ephemeral, the objects produced here are robust, they may be used directly or employed in subsequent fabrication processes. The produced sheets are used here as molds for glass-reinforced concrete casting offering excellent surface quality and the ability to create geometry unlike any conventional fabrication techniques. We present the design and development of the process and a proof-of-concept artwork produced.

AB  - The typical course timetabling problem is assigning Classes of students to appropriate faculty members, suitable classrooms and available timeslots. Hence, it involves a large number of stakeholders including students, teachers and institutional administrators. Different kinds of Hard Operational Research techniques have been employed over the years to address such problems. Due to the computational difficulties of this NP complete problem as well as the size and the complexity of the real world instances, an efficient optimal solution cannot be found easily.As an alternative strategy, this paper investigates the application of Checkland‘s Soft System Methodology (SSM) to the course timetabling problem. Besides giving an ideal course timetable, even to large and complex real problems, application of SSM, generates debate, learning, and understanding; enables key changes; facilitates negotiating the actions to be taken and makes possible the meaningful collaboration among concerned stakeholders. This paper also provides an appropriate course timetable for the management faculty at University of Tehran to show the potential of this application to real problems.

AB  - Creativity is defined quite simply as “the ability to create” in most lexicons, but, in reality, this is a complex and heterogeneous construct about which there is much to be discovered. The cognitive approach to investigating creativity recognizes and seeks to understand this complexity by investigating the component processes involved in creative thinking. The cognitive neuroscience approach, which has only limitedly been applied in the study of creativity, should ideally build on these ideas in uncovering the neural substrates of these processes. Following an introduction into the early experimental ideas and the cognitive approach to creativity, we discuss the theoretical background and behavioral methods for testing various processes of creative cognition, including conceptual expansion, the constraining influence of examples, creative imagery and insight. The complex relations between the underlying component processes of originality and relevance across these tasks are presented thereafter. We then outline how some of these conceptual distinctions can be evaluated by neuroscientific evidence and elaborate on the neuropsychological approach in the study of creativity. Given the current state of affairs, our recommendation is that despite methodological difficulties that are associated with investigating creativity, adopting the cognitive neuroscience perspective is a highly promising framework for validating and expanding on the critical issues that have been raised in this paper.

AB  - Freeze-drying is the most widespread method to preserve protein drugs and vaccines in a dry form facilitating their storage and transportation without the laborious and expensive cold chain. Extending this method for the preservation of natural biomaterials and cells in a dry form would provide similar benefits, but most results in the domain are still below expectations. In this review, rather than consider freeze-drying as a traditional black box we “break it” through a detailed process thinking approach. We discuss freeze-drying from process thinking aspects, introduce the chemical, physical, and mechanical environments important in this process, and present advanced biophotonic process analytical technology. In the end, we review the state of the art in the freeze-drying of the biomaterials, extracellular vesicles, and cells. We suggest that the rational design of the experiment and implementation of advanced biophotonic tools are required to successfully preserve the natural biomaterials and cells by freeze-drying. We discuss this change of paradigm with existing literature and elaborate on our perspective based on our new unpublished results.

AB  - In silico tools and resources are now used commonly in toxicology and to support the “Next Generation Risk Assessment” (NGRA) of cosmetics ingredients or materials. This review provides an overview of the approaches that are applied to assess the exposure and hazard of a cosmetic ingredient. For both hazard and exposure, databases of existing information are used routinely. In addition, for exposure, in silico approaches include the use of rules of thumb for systemic bioavailability as well as physiologically-based kinetics (PBK) and multi-scale models for estimating internal exposure at the organ or tissue level. (Internal) Thresholds of Toxicological Concern are applicable for the safety assessment of ingredients at low concentrations. The use of structural rules, (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationships ((Q)SARs) and read-across are the most typically applied modelling approaches to predict hazard. Data from exposure and hazard assessment are increasingly being brought together in NGRA to provide an overall assessment of the safety of a cosmetic ingredient. All in silico approaches are reviewed in terms of their maturity and robustness for use.

AB  - A new formulation of the central ideas of Boden's well-established theory on combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity is presented. This new formulation, based on the idea of conceptual space, redefines some terms and includes several types of concept properties (appropriateness and relevance), whose relationship facilitates the computational implementation of the transformational creativity mechanism. The presented formulation is applied to a real case of chocolate designing in which a novel and flavorful combination of chocolate and fruit is generated. The experimentation was conducted jointly with a Spanish chocolate chef. Experimental results prove the relationship between appropriateness and relevance in different frameworks and show that the formulation presented is not only useful for understanding how the creative mechanisms of design works but also facilitates its implementation in real cases to support creativity processes.

AB  - Automated journalism – the use of algorithms in writing news reports – underscores the new direction of media transformation in the 21st century as it may reshape how the news is produced and consumed. Such writing algorithms have been increasingly adopted in U.S. and Chinese newsroom, but how well they are accepted by news users deserves more research. A comparative study was thus conducted to examine how U.S. and Chinese news users perceive the quality of algorithm-generated news reports, how much they like and trust such reports. Results show that U.S. and Chinese users demonstrated more shared, rather than different, perceptions to automated news. The users did not perceive automated content in a linear way, but viewed them by considering the interaction of the authors (i.e., journalists or algorithms), the media outlets (i.e., traditional or online media) and cultural background (i.e., U.S. or Chinese users).

AB  - A new study in peer presentation of Threshold Concepts as the focus of learning in two core chemical engineering undergraduate courses has shown that students benefit from an explanatory and illustrative presentation they give to their class peers in place of the traditional lecturer. The methodology was that the lecturer identified a (progressively linked) inventory of Threshold Concepts and had students critically prepare and then explain these in brief (3–5min) presentation-and-question sessions to their cohort. The inventory was informed by Rowbottom's (2007) notion of looking for abilities for which a concept is necessary. The two courses were a level III core course on separations processing with 74 students and a level IV elective in specialist heat transfer with 15 students. Students welcomed and highly valued this type of learning with more than 90% agreeing that it improved understanding of the course material both because it revealed things better than their experiences in lectures and because it promoted a mental organisation of necessary course ideas. It is concluded that peer presentations of Threshold Concepts is a useful and economic instrument to overcoming traditional barriers to student learning. The findings could be readily applied to other courses in distinctive chemical engineering thinking and practise.

As a relatively young discipline that is continually evolving, our understanding of how we categorize the various facets of AI also must evolve and adapt. AI falls into just two categories: AI based on capability, and AI based on functionality. AI based on capability has three sub-categories, two of which remain as purely theoretical concepts. AI that is based on functionality is distinguished by four sub-categories, with each one targeted at different problems, and solving them.

AB  - Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships (QSAR) is a computational model used to describe and anticipate the interaction and surface interactions of substances. In addition, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used for the development of linear and sigmoidal functionals, aiming to predict low-carbon steel, copper, and aluminum corrosion rates corresponding to environmental parameters. Thus this chapter explains the theory behind the QSAR/ANN and demonstrates its effectiveness related to corrosion. QSAR aims to draw an attention to the link between the effectiveness of prevention (any function) and the structural features (adjectives). It involves finding one or more items that, by mathematical equation, link these definitions to their blocking function. ANN (artificial neural network) shows excellent performance in the prediction (output) for various complex characteristic data (input). The obtained results give deep insight into the corrosion systems by analyzing the point of surface corrosion attack, the more stable site of the inhibitor adsorption, and the binding power of the adsorbed coating.

AB  - The immune system is composed of networks of interacting cells and molecules; therefore, to understand and control immune behavior we need to adopt the thinking and tools of systems immunology. This review describes the use of an antigen microarray device and informatics to profile the repertoires of autoantibodies in health and disease. Autoantibody profiling provides an insight into the biomarkers used by the immune system in its dialog with the body. Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and HSP70 are cited as examples of key hubs in physiological regulatory networks; HSP molecules and peptides can be viewed as natural regulators because the immune system itself deploys them to modulate inflammatory reactions. The discovery of such natural biomarkers paves the way towards natural control.

This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy education and identify gaps where additional research is needed.
Findings
Seven studies specifically addressing the use of AI in pharmacy education were identified. Of these 7 studies, 5 focused on AI use in the context of teaching and learning, 1 on the prediction of academic performance for admissions, and the final study focused on using AI text generation to elucidate the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT use in pharmacy education.
Summary
There are currently a limited number of available publications that describe AI use in pharmacy education. Several challenges exist regarding the use of AI in pharmacy education, including the need for faculty expertise and time, limited generalizability of tools, limited outcomes data, and several legal and ethical concerns. As AI use increases and implementation becomes more standardized, opportunities will be created for the inclusion of AI in pharmacy education.

By relying on video data and ethnographic observations of the student teams' collaborative invention processes, the investigation focused on investigating 1) how the teams generated and developed their design ideas in their materially anchored making process and 2) what kinds of maker practices they relied on during open-ended invention projects. The study focused on a microanalytic study of three teams of students, and we utilized and developed visual data analysis methods. Our findings reveal the complex nature of the student teams' materially contextualized ideation and the knowledge creation activities that took place within their projects. The findings suggest that open-ended, materially mediated co-invention projects offer ample opportunities for creative cultural participation and practice-based knowledge creation in schools.

AB  - A growing gap between progress in biological knowledge and improved health outcomes inspired the new discipline of translational medicine, in which the application of new knowledge is an explicit part of a research plan. Abramson and Parashar argue that a similar gap between complex computational technologies and ever-more-challenging applications demands an analogous discipline of translational computer science, in which the deliberate movement of research results into large-scale practice becomes a central research focus rather than an afterthought. We revisit from this perspective the development and application of grid computing from the mid-1990s onwards, and find that a translational framing is useful for understanding the technology’s development and impact. We discuss how the development of grid computing infrastructure, and the Globus Toolkit, in particular, benefited from a translational approach. We identify lessons learned that can be applied to other translational computer science initiatives.

AB  - Additive manufacturing can increase the flexibility in the design phase of product development and that, in its turn, has changed the designer’s way of thinking. The design problem has reformulated; from designs that were not possible to be constructed, due to lack of equipment and technology, to constructions that the designer could not think to design. Topology optimization and generative design are useful tools in the hands of designer that can help him/her in the pursuit of the global optimum of a construction and in the choice of an alternative design solution respectively. However, topology optimization results are always depended on the given boundary conditions and restrictions. In other words, the designer’s decisions can affect the results of topology optimization and can easily lead to a local and not a global solution. In this paper, an identification and categorization of the most important parameters, that can affect the topology optimization results, were conducted. The main focus of the implemented research was on the pre-processing of topology optimization and especially on the designer’s decisions. The applied topology optimization approach here was a simple compliance optimization based on the SIMP interpolation methodology (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) and it was executed with the use of the commercial software Tosca (Abaqus). Different alternative designs of a wall bracket were used as a case study to test the sensitivity of the optimization algorithm and quantify the potential loss.

AB  - This paper proposes modeling of artificial emotions through agents based on symbolic approach. The symbolic approach utilizes symbolic emotional rule-based systems (rule base that generated emotions) with continuous interactions with environment and an internal “thinking” machinery that comes as a result of series of inferences, evaluation, evolution processes, adaptation, learning, and emotions. We build two models for agent based systems; one is supported with artificial emotions and the other one without emotions. We use both in solving a bench mark problem; “The Orphanage Care Problem”. The two systems are simulated and results are compared. Our study shows that systems with proper model of emotions can perform in many cases better than systems without emotions. We try to shed the light here on how artificial emotions can be modeled in a simple rule-based agent systems and if emotions as they exist in “real intelligence” can be helpful for “artificial intelligence”. Agent architectures are presented as a generic blueprint on which the design of agents can be based. Our focus is on the functional design, including flow of information and control. With this information provided, the generic blueprints of architectures should not be difficult to implement agents, thus putting these theoretical models into practice. We build the agents using this architecture, and many experiments and analysis are shown.

KW  - Chronic coronary syndrome

KW  - Coronary revascularization
AB  - Background
In chronic coronary syndromes, guidelines mandate invasive functional guidance of revascularization whenever non-invasive proof of ischemia is missing. ISIS-2 survey aimed to evaluate how the adoption of guideline recommendation on ischemia-guided revascularization has evolved over the last 5–7 years.
Methods
In ISIS-2 participants assessed five complete angiograms, presenting only intermediate stenoses without information on non-invasive pre-testing. Fractional flow reserve was known for each stenosis, but remained undisclosed. Participants could determine stenosis significance either by angiography or by requesting an adjunctive invasive diagnostic method (intravascular imaging or functional tests). Primary endpoint was the rate of requesting adjunctive functional assessment. Secondary endpoints were the rate of concordance between angiography-based decisions and know functional severity. ISIS-2 utilized the same web-based platform as ISIS-1 in 2013. (NCT04001452).
Results
334 participants performed 2059 lesion evaluations: 1202 (59%) decisions were based solely on angiography without expressed need for further evaluation. These decisions were discordant with known functional significance in 39%, mainly with potential of overtreatment. Participants requested invasive functional assessment in 643 (31%) and intravascular imaging in 214 (10%) cases. Compared to ISIS-1 the rate of purely angiography-based decisions has decreased (59% vs 66%; p < 0.001), while invasive functional tests were more frequently requested (31% vs 25%; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
ISIS-2 suggests an evolving pattern in the intention to integrate invasive coronary physiology into the revascularization decisions. However, the disconnect between recommendations and current thinking is still dominant.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The entire pharmaceutical sector is in an urgent need of both innovative technological solutions and fundamental scientific work, enabling the production of highly engineered drug products. Commercial-scale manufacturing of complex drug delivery systems (DDSs) using the existing technologies is challenging. This review covers important elements of manufacturing sciences, beginning with risk management strategies and design of experiments (DoE) techniques. Experimental techniques should, where possible, be supported by computational approaches. With that regard, state-of-art mechanistic process modeling techniques are described in detail. Implementation of materials science tools paves the way to molecular-based processing of future DDSs. A snapshot of some of the existing tools is presented. Additionally, general engineering principles are discussed covering process measurement and process control solutions. Last part of the review addresses future manufacturing solutions, covering continuous processing and, specifically, hot-melt processing and printing-based technologies. Finally, challenges related to implementing these technologies as a part of future health care systems are discussed.

AB  - Designers take advantage of tool ecologies in order to find the most purposeful way of connecting often distinct processes that inform morphological design and associated building performance feedback. The ability to set up logical connections of design parameters across different digital applications becomes ever more relevant in a time where the proliferation of computational tools has led to a fundamental transformation in architectural education. Morphological exploration and form-finding get increasingly enriched by environmental performance feedback. This paper points out a major step forward in software interoperability and the alignment of digital design applications, allowing users to engage with morphological form-finding enriched by real-time physical building performance feedback. The key innovation presented here relates to tools available to designers who neither possess in-depth programming skills, nor need to rely on custom-developed scripts in order to advance their concepts. A recent architectural design studio serves as a testbed to interrogate the level of convergence among tools for morphological design and performance optimization.

AB  - Neurodevelopment is not merely a process of brain maturation, but an adaptation to constraints unique to each individual and to the environments we co-create. However, our theoretical and methodological toolkits often ignore this reality. There is growing awareness that a shift is needed that allows us to study divergence of brain and behaviour across conventional categorical boundaries. However, we argue that in future our study of divergence must also incorporate the developmental dynamics that capture the emergence of those neurodevelopmental differences. This crucial step will require adjustments in study design and methodology. If our ultimate aim is to incorporate the developmental dynamics that capture how, and ultimately when, divergence takes place then we will need an analytic toolkit equal to these ambitions. We argue that the over reliance on group averages has been a conceptual dead-end with regard to the neurodevelopmental differences. This is in part because any individual differences and developmental dynamics are inevitably lost within the group average. Instead, analytic approaches which are themselves new, or simply newly applied within this context, may allow us to shift our theoretical and methodological frameworks from groups to individuals. Likewise, methods capable of modelling complex dynamic systems may allow us to understand the emergent dynamics only possible at the level of an interacting neural system.

AB  - Despite the common misperception of playing games as wasteful activity, studies found that some of its components may contribute to users’ knowledge generation, soft skill improvement, and foreign language learning. This article reports the development of an application for reading and the initial impacts of the gamification-based application on students’ reading comprehension in English. The application was aimed to support generation Z's university students who are well exposed to gadgets with the ability in comprehending challenging texts. In addition to the sociocultural theory of learning and second language acquisition theories, we considered factors like university students as users, texts’ complexity offered at the university level, and gamification features in designing the application. The study resulted in a prototype of a gaming activity called” ReadOn”. Surveys, interviews, and experiments were carried out on a small group of participants during, and after designing processes. The Survey data was used as a foundation to design the app while the interview and the experiments provided data to explore the usability of the newly built prototype. The data of students’ experience in using the prototype was used as feedback for future development of the platform.

AB  - Language has been used as a privileged window to investigate mental processes. More recently, descriptions of psychopathological symptoms have been analyzed with the help of natural language processing tools. An example is the study of speech organization using graph theoretical approaches that began approximately 10 years ago. After its application in different areas, there is a need to better characterize what aspects can be associated with typical and atypical behavior throughout the lifespan, given the variables related to aging as well as biological and social contexts. The precise quantification of mental processes assessed through language may allow us to disentangle biological/social markers by looking at naturalistic protocols in different contexts. In this review, we discuss 10 years of studies in which word recurrence graphs were adopted to characterize the chain of thoughts expressed by individuals while producing discourse. Initially developed to understand formal thought disorder in the context of psychotic syndromes, this line of research has been expanded to understand the atypical development in different stages of psychosis and differential diagnosis (such as dementia) as well as the typical development of thought organization in school-age children/teenagers in naturalistic and school-based protocols. We comment on the effects of environmental factors, such as education and reading habits (in monolingual and bilingual contexts), in clinical and nonclinical populations at different developmental stages (from childhood to older adulthood, considering aging effects on cognition). Looking toward the future, there is an opportunity to use word recurrence graphs to address complex questions that consider biological/social factors within a developmental perspective in typical and atypical contexts.

AB  - In spite of the progress in emotion research over the past 20years, emotions remain an elusive phenomenon. While some underlying circuitry has been identified for some aspects of affective processing (e.g., amygdala-mediated processing of threatening stimuli, the role of orbitofrontal cortex in emotion regulation), much remains unknown about the mechanisms of emotions. Computational models of cognitive and affective processes provide a unique and powerful means of refining psychological theories, and can help elucidate the mechanisms that mediate affective phenomena. This paper outlines a number of open questions and challenges associated with developing computational models of emotion, and with their integration within biologically-inspired cognitive architectures. These include the following: the extent to which mechanisms in biological affective agents should be simulated or emulated in affective BICAs; importance of more precise, design-based terminology; identification of fundamental affective processes, and the computational tasks necessary for their implementation; improved understanding of affective dynamics and development of more accurate models of these phenomena; and understanding the alternative means of integrating emotions within agent architectures. The challenges associated with data availability and model validation are also discussed.

AB  - How individual differences in visuospatial thinking relate to environment learning from navigation is of growing interest and needs to be approached systematically. Here, a sample of 292 undergraduates learnt a virtual path (desktop-based), and their learning accuracy was assessed with recall tasks, i.e. route retracing, shortcut finding and landmark locating tasks. Several individual visuospatial measures, tasks and questionnaires, were administered. Relations between individual measures and recall tasks were estimated with regression models taking quantitative evidence available in the literature into account, and treated as Bayesian informed priors established by a meta-analysis. The results provide robust evidence of visuospatial abilities and wayfinding inclinations (composing two distinct factors) both affecting recall task performance, particularly the former. A different contribution of individual measures as a function of recall task is envisaged. This study offers new insight on the role of individual visuospatial measures in environment learning (navigation-like) and how they are related.

AB  - In this present paper, wet clutch is analysed by Computational Modeling. 2-D drawings are designed for multi plate clutch from computational calculations. 3D model is created in the Solid Edge modeling software for bike clutch. FEM analysis of clutch is carried out by varying friction materials with some non metals and composite materials. The best material suited for the lining of friction surfaces is found. Thermal transient investigation will be done on the wet grating plates to check the quality. Modeling of multi plate clutch is done by using Solid edge Software and then the model is imported into ANSYS Software for Structural, Thermal analysis to check the quality and temperature contours. Results show that friction materials like Al alloy, Al oxide, Cast iron, Carbon fiber and Al nitride generate 146.31 °C, 136.77 °C, 146.44 °C, 149.99 °C and 144.54 °C respectively. Heat flux results with the above friction materials are respectively 1.18 w/mm2, 1.04 w/mm2, 0.56 w/mm2, 0.0085 w/mm2 and 1.25 w/mm2. A twin grasp transmission is very like the traditional programmed, the primary distinction being the twofold grip structure contrasted with the single programmed grasp utilized in automatics. Automatics utilize a torque converter to move motor torque from the motor to the transmission. Basic investigation for grip plate has done utilizing the properties of three materials which are utilized for liner (for example carbon–carbon composites, Kevlar, Ceramic composites). A twin grasp transmission is very like the traditional programmed, the primary distinction being the twofold grip structure contrasted with the single programmed grasp utilized in automatics.

AB  - To address the challenge of overwhelming data inherent in classroom lesson videos, this study proposed a visual learning analytics (VLA) approach to video-based teacher professional development (TPD). Using a two-year experimental design, 46 secondary mathematics teachers were divided randomly into a treatment group (N = 24) and a control group (N = 22) to learn about and integrate academically productive talk into their teaching. The treatment teachers participated in a VLA-supported TPD program, while the control teachers participated in conventional knowledge-based workshops. Results show that teachers in the treatment group had more positive beliefs and higher self-efficacy in the post-test and delayed-post-test, while the control group improved, but not significantly, in their beliefs about the usefulness of classroom talk. In addition, although the control group made a significant improvement in their self-efficacy in guiding classroom talk in the post-test, this improvement was not sustained to the delayed post-test. Moreover, the coding of classroom teaching behaviour revealed that teachers in the treatment group relative to the control group significantly increased their use of academically productive talk in the post-test lessons to encourage the students' elaboration, reasoning, and thinking with others in the classroom. The results suggest that, while attending knowledge-based workshops had, to some degree, positive effects on the control teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy, these effects were not sustainable over time. In contrast, the use of visual learning analytics to support the treatment group's reflection on the classroom data not only had significant and sustained effects on the teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy but also significantly influenced their actual classroom teaching behaviour. Implications for designing VLA to support teacher learning and professional development are discussed.

The focus is on their potential lessons for individuals leading and managing research collaborations, evaluation of research partnerships and areas for further investigation. Examples from three partnerships – building the atomic bomb, the Human Genome Project and the World Commission on Dams – are used to highlight key elements of the ideas presented. The paper provides a framework for systematically thinking about integration of different perspectives and other elements essential to any particular collaboration. It also sketches out ideas for (1) managing differences which may destroy partnerships, (2) deciding what the collaboration should encompass, (3) understanding and accommodating forces which may distort what the collaboration is able to achieve, and (4) enlisting necessary supporters while preserving research independence.

AB  - Prominent theories of morality have integrated philosophy with psychology and biology. Although this approach has been highly generative, we argue that it does not fully capture the rich and dynamic nature of moral cognition. We review research from the dual-process tradition, in which moral intuitions are automatically elicited and reasoning is subsequently deployed to correct these initial intuitions. We then describe how the computations underlying moral cognition are diverse and widely distributed throughout the brain. Finally, we illustrate how social context modulates these computations, recruiting different systems for real (vs. hypothetical) moral judgments, examining the dynamic process by which moral judgments are updated. In sum, we advocate for a shift from dual-process to dynamic system models of moral cognition.

AB  - Except for single-mode traditional Chinese medicine imaging techniques such as infrared thermal imaging, the one-stop multimodal whole-body imaging health examination technology and device is still blank. We focus on infrared thermal imaging as the main modality, integrated various modalities of medical imaging intelligent sensing agents such as terahertz imaging. The upper and lower computer and virtual instrument architecture are used, and the imaging data are collected by the lower computers that each is an intelligent sensing agent. The upper computer is used for image reconstruction with intelligent algorithms. Based on the core theory of traditional Chinese medicine, intelligent fusion imaging is achieved through various modalities to achieve the ‘observation, hearing, questioning, and palpation’ four diagnostic integration. We use fractional Fourier transform to filter imaging data, Laplacian pyramid for image fusion. We have proposed an implementation method and process for combining traditional Chinese medicine imaging large language model with knowledge graph, and based on deep learning, we have studied the image and report generation algorithm that combines traditional Chinese medicine pathology and four diagnostic methods with knowledge graph fusion, as well as the traditional Chinese medicine human physiological and pathological interpretation and evaluation system. We have achieved some results, and through further research and development, we can achieve commercial applications.

AB  - Localization and quantification of structural damage and estimating the failure probability are key outputs in the reliability assessment of structures. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to reduce the computational effort required for reliability analysis and damage detection. Toward this end, one demonstrative structure is modeled and then several damage scenarios are defined. These scenarios are considered as training data sets for establishing an ANN model. In this regard, the relationship between structural response (input) and structural stiffness (output) is established using ANN models. The established ANN is more economical and achieves reasonable accuracy in detection of structural damage under a set of ground motions. Furthermore, in order to assess the reliability of a structure, five random variables are considered. These are columns’ area of the first, second, and third floor, elasticity modulus, and gravity loads. The ANN is trained by suing the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) technique. Finally, the trained neural network specifies the failure probability of the proposed structure. Although MCS can predict the failure probability for a given structure, the ANN model helps simulation techniques to receive an acceptable accuracy and reduce computational effort.

AB  - As the call for sustainable solutions at operational, industrial, and policy level increases, the need for a comprehensive assessment tool has been addressed by literature and practitioners. In particular, for the definition of a complete framework, the application of a life cycle thinking lens is required to explore the longitudinal dimension of the impacts and possible indirect effects triggered on environmental, social, and economic levels. The definition of an integrated life cycle sustainability assessment framework is currently an ongoing journey, which is summarized in the present chapters. The narrative follows a set of milestones, namely the definition of the concept and the preliminary scheme in the early years, the pathway towards the implementation of a standardized set of tools, an anthology of significant case studies in different sectors, and an overview of the challenges identified by literature and yet remaining open for future researches.

AB  - In this chapter, we present a set of concepts and tools for defining and examining strategic choice that are drawn from behavioral economics and discuss how they can be applied to and tested with neuroscience techniques. The standard language for studying strategic choice in economics is game theory. Game theory provides concrete mathematical formulas for linking strategic actions to rewarding payoffs. After outlining the four components necessary to make predictions about strategic social behavior, we present recent evidence that the computations predicted by game theory in specific strategic choice contexts are reflected in the brain. In addition, we discuss links between strategic decision making and the psychological concept of theory of mind. We conclude by suggesting that developing mathematical models of social and strategic actions may aid in the understanding of how the brain implements typical choice behavior as well as categorizing dysfunctions that lead to aberrant behavior in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Serotonergic psychedelics have been suggested to mirror certain aspects of psychosis, and, more generally, elicit a state of consciousness underpinned by increased entropy of on-going neural activity. We investigated the hypothesis that language produced under the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) should exhibit increased entropy and reduced semantic coherence. Computational analysis of interviews conducted at two different time points after 75 μg of intravenous LSD verified this prediction. Non-semantic analysis of speech organization revealed increased verbosity and a reduced lexicon, changes that are more similar to those observed during manic psychoses than in schizophrenia, which was confirmed by direct comparison with reference samples. Importantly, features related to language organization allowed machine learning classifiers to identify speech under LSD with accuracy comparable to that obtained by examining semantic content. These results constitute a quantitative and objective characterization of disorganized natural speech as a landmark feature of the psychedelic state.

KW  - Single person study
AB  - This paper represents a personal view of the state of HCI as a design discipline and as a scientific discipline, and how this is changing in the face of new technological and social situations. Going back 20years a frequent topic of discussion was whether HCI was a ‘discipline’. It is unclear whether this was ever a fruitful topic, but academic disciplines are effectively about academic communities and there is ample evidence of the long-term stability of the international HCI/CHI community. However, as in computer ‘science’, the central scientific core of HCI is perhaps still unclear; for example, a strength of HCI is the closeness between theory and practice, but the corresponding danger is that the two are often confused. The paper focuses particularly on the challenge of methodological thinking in HCI, especially as the technological and social context of HCI rapidly changes. This is set alongside two other challenges: the development of reliable knowledge in HCI and the clear understanding of interlinked human roles within the discipline. As a case study of the need for methodological thinking, the paper considers the use of single person studies in research and design. These are likely to be particularly valuable as we move from a small number of applications used by many people to a ‘long tail’ where large numbers of applications are used by small numbers of people. This change calls for different practical design strategies; focusing on the peak experience of a few rather than acceptable performance for many. Moving back to the broader picture, as we see more diversity both in terms of types of systems and kinds of concerns, this may also be an opportunity to reflect on what is core across these; potential fragmentation becoming a locus to understand more clearly what defines HCI, not just for the things we see now, but for the future that we cannot see.

AB  - Coffee is regarded as the highest consumed drink around the globe and has accounted as a major source of income in the regions where it is cultivated. To meet the coffee marketplace's requirements around the globe, cultivators must boost and analyze its cultivation and quality. Several factors like environmental changes and plant diseases are the major hindrance to increasing the yield of coffee. The development in the field of computer vision has facilitated the earliest diagnostic of diseased plant samples, however, the incidence of various image distortions i.e., color, light, size, orientation changes, and similarity in the healthy and diseased portions of examined samples are the major challenges in the effective recognition of various coffee plant leaf infections. The proposed work is focused to overwhelm the mentioned limitations by proposing a novel and effective DL model called the CoffeeNet. Explicitly, an improved CenterNet approach is proposed by introducing spatial-channel attention strategy-based ResNet-50 model for the computation of deep and disease-specific sample characteristics which are then classified by the 1-step detector of the CenterNet framework. We investigated the localization and cataloging outcomes of the suggested method on the Arabica coffee leaf repository which contains the images captured in the more realistic and complicated environmental constraints. The CoffeeNet model acquires a classification accuracy number of 98.54%, along with an mAP of 0.97 that is presenting the usefulness of our technique in localizing and categorizing various sorts of coffee plant leaf disorders.

AB  - The present analysis aims at a theoretical integration of, and a systems-neuroscience perspective on, a variety of historical and contemporary views on perception–action coordination (PAC). We set out to determine the common principles or lawful linkages between sensory and motor systems that explain how perception is action-oriented and how action is perceptually guided. To this end, we analyze the key ingredients to such an integrated framework, examine the architecture of dual-system conjectures of PAC, and endeavor in an historical analysis of the key characteristics, mechanisms, and phenomena of PACs. This analysis will reveal that dual-systems views are in need of fundamental re-thinking, and its elements will be amalgamated with current views on action-oriented predictive processing into a novel integrative theoretical framework (IMPPACT: Impetus, Motivation, and Prediction in Perception–Action Coordination theory). From this framework and its neurocognitive architecture we derive a number of non-trivial predictions regarding conative, motive-driven PAC. We end by presenting a brief outlook on how IMPPACT might present novel insights into certain pathologies and into action expertise.

AB  - Across disciplines, it is common practice to bring together groups to solve complex problems. Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent’s conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research.

AB  - There is now general consensus that at least some of the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are related to dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine (DA) system. At the cellular and synaptic level, the effects of DA in PFC via D1- and D2-class receptors are highly complex, often apparently opposing, and hence difficult to understand with regard to their functional implications. Biophysically realistic computational models have provided valuable insights into how the effects of DA on PFC neurons and synaptic currents as measured in vitro link up to the neural network and cognitive levels. They suggest the existence of two discrete dynamical regimes, a D1-dominated state characterized by a high energy barrier among different network patterns that favors robust online maintenance of information and a D2-dominated state characterized by a low energy barrier that is beneficial for flexible and fast switching among representational states. These predictions are consistent with a variety of electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral results in humans and nonhuman species. Moreover, these biophysically based models predict that imbalanced D1:D2 receptor activation causing extremely low or extremely high energy barriers among activity states could lead to the emergence of cognitive, positive, and negative symptoms observed in schizophrenia. Thus, combined experimental and computational approaches hold the promise of allowing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how DA alters information processing in normal and pathological conditions, thereby potentially providing new routes for the development of pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia.

AB  - Crane-lift path planning (CLPP) ensures the safe and efficient installation of hefty modules in high-rise modular integrated construction (MiC). The implementation of CLPP requires effective collision detection strategies. However, existing collision detection strategies suffer from limitations in terms of computational intensity or insufficient accuracy. This paper aims to develop a fast and accurate collision detection strategy for CLPP in high-rise MiC projects using a single tower crane, thereby achieving safe and efficient module installation. It is executed with the assumptions that the geometry of the building remains unchanged, the positions and orientations of the lifted module and the tower crane are monitored, and no external loads act on the lifted module. Based on the research scope and assumptions, an octree and bounding box (Oct-Box) integrated strategy is developed. The strategy operates in two stages, the pre-execution and execution stages, supported by two critical technical components: (1) an optimized octree for lifting space division and encoding, and (2) an integrated bounding box algorithm for construction object collision detection. The strategy was evaluated using a real-life MiC project in Hong Kong. The results show that the developed strategy minimized the CLPP time by about 95 %, while ensuring continuous and accurate collision detection. In addition, the strategy was significantly affected by the depth of octree, the encoding method of octree, the bounding box algorithm and the configuration density. The developed Oct-Box strategy for CLPP is novel as it addresses temporal efficiency and spatial tightness in tandem, and marks a breakthrough for collision detection in modular construction.

AB  - Aim
Psychotic symptoms are typically measured using clinical ratings, but more objective and sensitive metrics are needed. Hence, we will assess thought disorder using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) heuristic for language production, and its recommended paradigm of “linguistic corpus-based analyses of language output”. Positive thought disorder (e.g., tangentiality and derailment) can be assessed using word-embedding approaches that assess semantic coherence, whereas negative thought disorder (e.g., concreteness, poverty of speech) can be assessed using part-of-speech (POS) tagging to assess syntactic complexity. We aim to establish convergent validity of automated linguistic metrics with clinical ratings, assess normative demographic variance, determine cognitive and functional correlates, and replicate their predictive power for psychosis transition among at-risk youths.
Methods
This study will assess language production in 450 English-speaking individuals in Australia and Canada, who have recent onset psychosis, are at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, or who are healthy volunteers, all well-characterized for cognition, function and symptoms. Speech will be elicited using open-ended interviews. Audio files will be transcribed and preprocessed for automated natural language processing (NLP) analyses of coherence and complexity. Data analyses include canonical correlation, multivariate linear regression with regularization, and machine-learning classification of group status and psychosis outcome.
Conclusions
This prospective study aims to characterize language disturbance across stages of psychosis using computational approaches, including psychometric properties, normative variance and clinical correlates, important for biomarker development. SPEAK will create a large archive of language data available to other investigators, a rich resource for the field.

Modern medicinal chemistry is responsible for integrating innovation throughout early drug discovery, including new screening paradigms, computational approaches, novel synthetic chemistry, gene-family screening, investigating routes of delivery, and so on.

AB  - Sequence kernels have been widely used for learning from sequential data. In recent years, a significant effort has been devoted to sequence kernels focusing on individual problems, and so devising several approaches. As a contribution in developing a unified theory of machine learning, in this paper, we complement our previous general framework that deals with sequence kernels, termed weighted automata sequence kernel. We provide a more formal presentation of the framework fully supported with proofs. In fact, the mapping of a string s to a high dimensional feature space can be modeled by a formal power series that can be realized by a weighted automaton (WA) As representing all subsequences of the string s. The computation of the kernel K(s,t) between two strings is the behavior of the intersection weighted automaton As,t=As∩At. Regarding kernel computation efficiency, we propose a forward lookup automaton intersection technique to prevent unsuccessful ε-paths while evaluating the WA computations. The experiments use the Reuters-21578 collection. The results reveal that the kernel evaluation using our proposed technique is faster than the one that uses standard intersection. In order To highlight the unification aspect of our model, we study the relationship between our general framework and a variety of common sequence kernels. Finally, we prove that the proposed formalization can be generalized to sequence multiset kernels showing the robustness of our approach. In our case, the new defined sequence multiset kernel can also be seen as a tree kernel.

Where Smart Grids focus primarily on the electricity sector, Smart Energy Systems take an integrated holistic focus on the inclusion of more sectors (electricity, heating, cooling, industry, buildings and transportation) and allows for the identification of more achievable and affordable solutions to the transformation into future renewable and sustainable energy solutions. This paper first makes a review of the scientific literature within the field. Thereafter it discusses the term Smart Energy Systems with regard to the issues of definition, identification of solutions, modelling, and integration of storage. The conclusion is that the Smart Energy System concept represents a scientific shift in paradigms away from single-sector thinking to a coherent energy systems understanding on how to benefit from the integration of all sectors and infrastructures.

AB  - Planning and optimization of facility layouts have been investigated for decades and manifold approaches are applied for structuring and design of production layouts. However, results heavily depend on the experience and creativity of involved planning experts. Currently, complexity of planning processes constantly increases, e.g. due to further requirements of energy and media supply. Generative Design, hitherto mainly applied in component development, provides opportunities to cope with a much larger solution space and develop creative layout concepts. Thus, based on a structured overview on established planning methods, a concept and first results of factory layout planning with Generative Design are described.

AB  - In recent years, reinforcement learning and bandits have transformed a wide range of real-world applications including healthcare, finance, recommendation systems, robotics, and last but not least, the speech and natural language processing. While most speech and language applications of reinforcement learning algorithms are centered around improving the training of deep neural networks with its flexible optimization properties, there are still many grounds to explore to utilize the benefits of reinforcement learning, such as its reward-driven adaptability, state representations, temporal structures and generalizability. In this survey, we present an overview of recent advancements of reinforcement learning and bandits including those in the large language models, and discuss how they can be effectively employed to solve speech and natural language processing problems with models that are adaptive, interactive and scalable.

AB  - The performance of conventional computer based on von Neumann architecture is limited due to the physical separation of memory and processor. By synergistically integrating various sensors with synaptic devices, recently emerging interactive neuromorphic devices can directly sense/store/process various stimuli information from external environments and implement functions of perception, learning, memory, and computation. In this review, we present the basic model of bioinspired interactive neuromorphic devices and discuss the performance metrics. Next, we summarize the recent progress and development of bioinspired interactive neuromorphic devices, which are classified into neuromorphic tactile systems, visual systems, auditory systems, and multisensory system. They are discussed in detail from the aspects of materials, device architectures, operating mechanisms, synaptic plasticity, and potential applications. Additionally, the bioinspired interactive neuromorphic devices that can fuse multiple/mixed sensing signals are proposed to address more realistic and sophisticated problems. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons regarding to the computing neurons and integrating sensory neurons and deliver the perspectives on interactive neuromorphic devices at the material, device, network, and system levels. It is believed the neuromorphic devices can provide promising solutions to next generation of interactive sensation/memory/computation toward the development of multimodal, low-power, and large-scale intelligent systems endowed with neuromorphic features.

AB  - Online child sexual groomers manipulate their targets into partaking in sexual activity online and, in some cases, offline. To do so they use language (and other semiotic means, such as images) strategically. This study uses a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies methodology to identify recurring patterns in online groomers' language use, mapping them to the specific grooming goal that their use in context fulfils. The analysis of the groomers' language (c. 3.3 million words) within 622 conversations from the Perverted Justice website newly identifies 70 such recurring linguistic patterns (three-word collocations), as well as their relative strength of association to one or more grooming goals. The results can be used to inform computational models for detecting online child sexual grooming language. They can also support the development of training resources that raise awareness of typical language structures that characterise online sexual groomers’ communicative modus operandi.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate, at a fine-grained level of detail, the theorems-in-action deployed and the constraints encountered by middle-school students in reasoning reversibly in the multiplicative domain of fraction. A theorem-in-action (Vergnaud, 1988) is a conceptual construct to trace students’ reasoning in a problem solving situation. Two seventh grade students were interviewed in a rural middle-school in the southern part of the United States. The students’ strategies were examined with respect to the numerical features of the problem situations and the ways they viewed and operated on fractional units. The results show that reversible reasoning is sensitive to the numeric feature of problem parameters. Relatively prime numbers and fractional quantities acted as inhibitors preventing the cueing of the multiplication–division invariant, thereby constraining students from reasoning reversibly. Among others, two key resources were identified as being essential for reasoning reversibly in fractional contexts: firstly, interpreting fractions in terms of units, which enabled the students to access their whole number knowledge and secondly, the unit-rate theorem-in-action. Failure to conceptualize multiplicative relations in reverse constrained the students to use more primitive strategies, leading them to solve problems non-deterministically and at higher computational costs.

AB  - The paper introduces a computational model of airspace conflict risk in the hierarchy of performance-based navigation (PBN) airspace operation and combines it with air traffic controller (ATC) workload to propose a method for safety assessment of PBN airspace operational planning. Capacity probability distribution is employed to depict airspace capacity in uncertain weather, errors of deviating from nominal PBN track are taken into consideration, and the stochastic process based on Gaussian distribution is used to depict random aircraft motion according to airspace PBN specification, so as to build an airspace conflict risk computational model in corresponding capacity scenario. Guangzhou No. 15 sector is chosen for simulation validation. The analysis results suggest that 60% of ATC workload is corresponding to sector traffic flow of 31 aircraft/h and airspace risk of 0.018 conflict/h, while 70% of ATC workload is corresponding to sector traffic flow of 35 aircraft/h and airspace risk of 0.03 conflict/h. As air traffic flow increases, both airspace conflict risk value and ATC workload will increase, resulting in reduction of airspace safety, though their increasing magnitudes differ with different capacity scenarios. The safety assessment method enables effective quantization of safety with regard to airspace operational planning strategy, and benefits the development of optimal operational scheme that balances risk with capacity demand.

AB  - Wind storm and hurricane risks are attracting increased attention as a result of recent catastrophic events. The aim of this paper is to select, tailor, and develop extreme value methods for use in wind storm insurance. The methods are applied to the 1982–2005 losses for the largest Swedish insurance company, the Länsförsäkringar group. Both a univariate and a new bivariate Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) gave models which fitted the data well. The bivariate model led to lower estimates of risk, except for extreme cases, but taking statistical uncertainty into account the two models lead to qualitatively similar results. We believe that the bivariate model provided the most realistic picture of the real uncertainties. It additionally made it possible to explore the effects of changes in the insurance portfolio, and showed that loss distributions are rather insensitive to portfolio changes. We found a small trend in the sizes of small individual claims, but no other trends. Finally, we believe that companies should develop systematic ways of thinking about “not yet seen” disasters.

AB  - Background
Objective diagnostic approaches need to be tested to enhance the efficacy of depression detection. Non-invasive EEG-based identification represents a promising area.
Aims
The present EEG study addresses two central questions: 1) whether inner or overt speech condition result in higher diagnositc accuracy of depression detection; and 2) does the affective nature of the presented emotion words count in such diagnostic approach.
Methods
A matched case-control sample consisting of 10 depressed subjects and 10 healthy controls was assessed. An EEG headcap containing 64 electrodes measured neural responses to experimental cues presented in the form of 15 different words that belonged to three emotional categories: neutral, positive, and negative. 120 experimental cues was presented for every participant, each containing an “inner speech” and an “overt speech” segment. An EEGNet neural network was utilized.
Results
The highest diagnostic accuracy of the EEGNet model was observed in the case of the overt speech condition (i.e. 69.5%), while a an overall subject-wise accuracy of 80% was achieved by the model. Only a negligible difference in diagnostic accuracy could be found between aggregated emotion word categories, with the highest accuracy (i.e. 70.2%) associated with the presentation of positive emotion words. Model decision was primarily influenced by electrodes representing the regions of the left parietal, the left temporal lobe and the middle frontal areas.
Conclusions
While the generalizability of our results is limited by the small sample size and potentially uncontrolled confounders, depression was associated with sensitive and presumably network-like aspects of these brain areas, potentially implying a higher level of emotion regulation that increases primarily in open communication.

AB  - The processes and organizational principles of information involved in object recognition have been a subject of intense debate. These research efforts led to the understanding that local computations and feedforward/feedback connections are essential to our representations and their organization. Recent data, however, has demonstrated that distal computations also play a role in how information is locally processed. Here we focus on how long-range connectivity and local functional organization of information are related, by exploring regions that show overlapping category-preferences for two categories and testing whether their connections are related with distal representations in a category-specific way. We used an approach that relates functional connectivity with distal areas to local voxel-wise category-preferences. Specifically, we focused on two areas that show an overlap in category-preferences for tools and hands–the inferior parietal lobule/anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPL/aIPS) and the posterior middle temporal gyrus/lateral occipital temporal cortex (pMTG/LOTC) – and how connectivity from these two areas relate to voxel-wise category-preferences in two ventral temporal regions dedicated to the processing of tools and hands separately–the left medial fusiform gyrus and the fusiform body area respectively–as well as across the brain. We show that the functional connections of the two overlap areas correlate with categorical preferences for each category independently. These results show that regions that process both tools and hands maintain object topography in a category-specific way. This potentially allows for a category-specific flow of information that is pertinent to computing object representations.

AB  - Traditionally, individual financial risk tolerance information is gathered via questionnaires or similar structured psychometric tools. Our abundant digital footprint, as an unstructured alternative, is less investigated. Leveraging such information can potentially support large-scale and cost-efficient financial services. Therefore, I explore the possibility of building a computational model that distills risk tolerance information from user texts in this study, and discuss the design principles discovered from empirical results and their implications. Specifically, a new quaternary classification task is defined for text mining-based risk profiling. Experiments show that pre-trained large language models set a baseline micro-F1 of circa 0.34. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the reported system achieves a micro-F1 of circa 0.51, which significantly outperforms the baselines, and is a circa 4% further improvement over the standard CNN configurations (micro-F1 of circa 0.47). Textual feature richness and supervised learning are found to be the key contributors to model performances, while other machine learning strategies suggested by previous research (data augmentation and multi-tasking) are less effective. The findings confirm user texts to be a useful risk profiling resource and provide several insights on this task.

AB  - In this paper, a class of single-allocation hub location problems is investigated from the perspective of upgrading. The latter is understood as an improvement of a set of edges to increase their individual performance, e.g., a decreased unit transportation cost. The goal is to obtain an improved optimal solution to the problem compared to that obtained if upgrading was not done. A budget constraint is assumed to limit the upgrading operations. A flow-based formulation is initially proposed that extends a classical model for uncapacitated single-allocation hub location with complete hub networks. Nevertheless, the fact that the unit costs after upgrading may violate the triangle inequality needs to be accounted for. Since the proposed formulation has a high computing burden, different possibilities are discussed for enhancing it. This leads to devising an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm with different variants. Additionally, a formulation based on the discrete ordered median function is also introduced that is also enhanced and embedded into a branch-and-cut algorithm again with several variants. All models and algorithms are also adapted to problems embedding hub network design decisions. Extensive computational tests were conducted to assess the methodological contributions proposed.

AB  - We point out the need for Behavioral Operational Research (BOR) in advancing the practice of OR. So far, in OR behavioral phenomena have been acknowledged only in behavioral decision theory but behavioral issues are always present when supporting human problem solving by modeling. Behavioral effects can relate to the group interaction and communication when facilitating with OR models as well as to the possibility of procedural mistakes and cognitive biases. As an illustrative example we use well known system dynamics studies related to the understanding of accumulation. We show that one gets completely opposite results depending on the way the phenomenon is described and how the questions are phrased and graphs used. The results suggest that OR processes are highly sensitive to various behavioral effects. As a result, we need to pay attention to the way we communicate about models as they are being increasingly used in addressing important problems like climate change.

AB  - In order to understand the dynamics of emergence and spreading of socio-technical innovations and population moves it is important to determine the place of origin of these populations. Here we focus on the role of geographical factors, such as land fertility and mountains in the context of human population evolution and distribution dynamics. We use a constrained diffusion-based computational model, computer simulations and the analysis of geographical and land-quality data. Our analysis shows that successful human populations, i.e. those which become dominant in their socio – geographical environment, originate from lands of many valleys with relatively low land fertility, which are close to areas of high land fertility. Many of the homelands predicted by our analysis match the assumed homelands of known successful populations (e.g. Bantus, Turkic, Maya). We also predict other likely homelands as well, where further archaeological, linguistic or genetic exploration may confirm the place of origin for populations with no currently identified urheimat. Our work is significant because it advances the understanding of human population dynamics by guiding the identification of the origin locations of successful populations.

AB  - Real-world PLC software is modular and composed of many different function blocks. Due to its cyclic execution, an engineer’s mental model of a single function block often exhibits state machine semantics – partitioning a block’s behaviours into different modes of operation. We propose a technique called mode abstraction for automatic computation of such high-level models from program semantics and investigate its impact on the overall model checking performance. To this end, we use constrained horn clauses to characterise the program semantics, mode transitions and safety goals in a compositional way. The resulting verification conditions are discharged using an SMT solver. Evaluation of our prototypical implementation on examples from the PLCopen Safety library shows the effectiveness of both the chosen formalism and mode abstraction.

AB  - Since effective thermal insulation of buildings could significantly decrease energy consumption worldwide, this study examined the potential of concrete tiles with complex geometries at improving thermal performance in building envelopes. The study focused on air flow characteristics that occur near the external surface of the tile, and their influence on the rate of heat transfer within the material. Six groups of sculptured tiles were developed, using a systematic approach (i.e., repetition of basic geometries), biomimicry, and inspiration from natural envelopes. Air flow behavior and heat transfer rates were examined at three different wind speeds, through both experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations using a configuration of flow impingement that can be regarded as the worst case scenario. After successfully validating the data, additional numerical simulations were conducted for all developed tiles using the Star-CCM + commercial software. The results showed an improvement in the insulation performance of about half of all the tested cases. Moreover, significant improvements were seen in the geometries that mimicked animal fur, achieving heat transfer rates that were up to 24% lower than those achieved by smooth tiles. Our results indicate that the application of such tiles with increased thermal resistance could save on thermal insulation materials and improve the thermal performance of building façades.

Particularly in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, spectacular results have been achieved. The hype has now infiltrated several scientific communities. In (nano-) photonics, researchers are trying to apply deep learning to all kinds of forward and inverse problems. A particularly challenging problem is for instance the rational design of nanophotonic materials and devices. In this opinion article, I will first discuss the public expectations of deep learning and give an overview of the quite different scales at which actors from industry and research are operating their deep learning models. I then examine the weaknesses and dangers associated with deep learning.

AB  - Predictive coding posits that neural systems make forward-looking predictions about incoming information. Neural signals contain information not about the currently perceived stimulus, but about the difference between the observed and the predicted stimulus. We propose to extend the predictive coding framework from high-level sensory processing to the more abstract domain of theory of mind; that is, to inferences about others’ goals, thoughts, and personalities. We review evidence that, across brain regions, neural responses to depictions of human behavior, from biological motion to trait descriptions, exhibit a key signature of predictive coding: reduced activity to predictable stimuli. We discuss how future experiments could distinguish predictive coding from alternative explanations of this response profile. This framework may provide an important new window on the neural computations underlying theory of mind.

AB  - The application of mathematics mainly graph theory has a significant role in the development of chemistry. Topological indices act as a bridge between mathematics and chemistry. The topological index is nothing but a numerical quantity that has yielded valuable insights in terms of molecular structure. In nanotechnology, the structural characterization of the molecular species and the nanoparticles are indicated by the indices. These indices identify the symmetry of molecular structures and provide them a scientific terminology to predict qualities like boiling temperatures, viscosity, and gyrating radius. The main objective of the current paper is to compute topological indices with the corresponding formulae, moreover, these indices help in predicting physicochemical properties without the involvement of the laboratory. The current research paper investigated the computation of degree-based topological indices for the nanotubes HAC5C6C7[a,b] and TU(C4C6C8[a,b].

Analogies to the behavior of real biological neural systems are also noted. The alternatives for implementing the same computations are discussed and compared from a computational efficiency standpoint, with the conclusion that implementing neural networks on neuromorphic hardware is significantly more power efficient than numerical integration of model equations on traditional digital hardware.

AB  - Summary
Rangeomorphs are among the oldest putative eumetazoans known from the fossil record. Establishing how they fed is thus key to understanding the structure and function of the earliest animal ecosystems. Here, we use computational fluid dynamics to test hypothesized feeding modes for the fence-like rangeomorph Pectinifrons abyssalis, comparing this to the morphologically similar extant carnivorous sponge Chondrocladia lyra. Our results reveal complex patterns of flow around P. abyssalis unlike those previously reconstructed for any other Ediacaran taxon. Comparisons with C. lyra reveal substantial differences between the two organisms, suggesting they converged on a similar fence-like morphology for different functions. We argue that the flow patterns recovered for P. abyssalis do not support either a suspension feeding or osmotrophic feeding habit. Instead, our results indicate that rangeomorph fronds may represent organs adapted for gas exchange. If correct, this interpretation could require a dramatic reinterpretation of the oldest macroscopic animals.

AB  - Multi-agent learning (MAL) studies how agents learn to behave optimally and adaptively from their experience when interacting with other agents in dynamic environments. The outcome of a MAL process is jointly determined by all agents’ decision-making. Hence, each agent needs to think strategically about others’ sequential moves, when planning future actions. The strategic interactions among agents makes MAL go beyond the direct extension of single-agent learning to multiple agents. With the strategic thinking, each agent aims to build a subjective model of others decision-making using its observations. Such modeling is directly influenced by agents’ perception during the learning process, which is called the information structure of the agent’s learning. As it determines the input to MAL processes, information structures play a significant role in the learning mechanisms of the agents. This review creates a taxonomy of MAL and establishes a unified and systematic way to understand MAL from the perspective of information structures. We define three fundamental components of MAL: the information structure (i.e., what the agent can observe), the belief generation (i.e., how the agent forms a belief about others based on the observations), as well as the policy generation (i.e., how the agent generates its policy based on its belief). In addition, this taxonomy enables the classification of a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms into four categories based on the belief-generation mechanisms of the opponents, including stationary, conjectured, calibrated, and sophisticated opponents. We introduce Value of Information (VoI) as a metric to quantify the impact of different information structures on MAL. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of algorithms from different categories and point to promising avenues of future research.

AB  - In this work, a new evolutionary model is proposed for ranking answers to non-factoid (how-to) questions in community question-answering platforms. The approach combines evolutionary computation techniques and clustering methods to effectively rate best answers from web-based user-generated contents, so as to generate new rankings of answers. Discovered clusters contain semantically related triplets representing question–answers pairs in terms of subject-verb-object, which is hypothesized to improve the ranking of candidate answers. Experiments were conducted using our evolutionary model and concept clustering operating on large-scale data extracted from Yahoo! Answers. Results show the promise of the approach to effectively discovering semantically similar questions and improving the ranking as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In this work we study pebble automata. Those automata constitute an infinite hierarchy of discrete models of computation. The hierarchy begins at the level of finite state automata (0-pebble automata) and approaches the model of one-tape Turing machines. Thus, it can be argued that it is a complete hierarchy that covers, in a continuous way, all the models of automata that are important in the theory of computation. We investigate the use of this hierarchy as a narrative for the teaching of automata theory. We also investigate some fundamental questions concerning the power of pebble automata.

AB  - Despite some recent progress, scenario planning's development as an academic discipline remains constrained by the perception it is solely a practical tool for thinking about the future, with limited theoretical foundations. The paper addresses this issue by showing that G. L. S. Shackle's ‘Potential Surprise Theory’ (PST) contains much that can lend theoretical support to scenario planning - especially its use of plausibility rather than probability, and its focus on potential extreme outcomes. Moreover, PST and scenario planning share the same ontology, viewing the future as constructed by the imagination of individuals. Yet, under PST, while the future is imagined and, therefore, subjective, individuals nevertheless seek to identify the ‘best’ option through a deductive process of elimination. PST therefore assists in overcoming the divide between the constructivist and deductivist perspectives in scenario planning as it employs both. Finally, the paper shows that theoretically underpinning scenario planning with PST would place it at the heart of contemporary debates on decision making under uncertainty taking place in economics and other fields, enhancing its status and profile as a discipline.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has brought crucial changes to the whole field of natural sciences. Myriads of machine learning algorithms have been developed to facilitate the work of experimental scientists. Molecular property prediction and drug synthesis planning become routine tasks. Moreover, inverse design of compounds with tunable properties as well as on-the-fly autonomous process optimization and chemical space exploration became possible in silico. Affordable robotic platforms exist able to perform thousands of experiments every day, analyzing the results and tuning the protocols. Despite this, most of these developments get trapped at the stage of code or overlooked, limiting their use by experimental scientists. Meanwhile, visibility and the number of user-friendly tools and technologies available to date is too low to compensate for this fact, rendering the development of novel therapeutic compounds inefficient. In this Review, we set the goal to bridge the gap between modern technologies and experimental scientists to improve drug development efficacy. Here we survey advanced and easy-to-use technologies able to help medical chemists at every stage of their research, including those integrated in technological processes during COVID-19 pandemic motivated by the need for fast yet precise solutions. Moreover, we review how these technologies are integrated by industry and clinics to streamline drug development and production. These technologies already transform the current paradigm of scientific thinking and revolutionize not only medicinal chemistry, but the whole field of natural sciences.

AB  - Energy-conservative, hyperelastic solids assume the existence of a stored energy density which relates stresses and strains for any deformation state. The usual approach to model such materials is to impose an analytical expression of the stored energy function as a function of some invariants and material parameters. These material parameters are best-fitted to available experimental data. This approach is good for analytical derivations but less optimal for data-driven computational approaches and for accurate and efficient finite element analyses. We show in this paper that the stored energy solution of a solid may be accurately obtained in a general case from suitable numerical procedures, regardless of the invariants being use, without using material parameters nor fitting any assumed analytical form. We explain two general, simple, computational procedures to solve the problem. The numerically computed stored energies may be used in general-purpose finite element programs, yielding more general procedures that have an efficiency equivalent to that of the classical approach, which uses pre-defined analytical “models” and fitting parameters.

AB  - The access of unified power flow controllers (UPFC) has changed the structure and operation mode of power grids all across the world, and it has brought severe challenges to the traditional real-time calculation of security correction based on traditional models. Considering the limitation of computational efficiency regarding complex, physical models, a data-driven power system security correction method with UPFC is, in this paper, proposed. Based on the complex mapping relationship between the operation state data and the security correction strategy, a two-stage deep neural network (DNN) learning framework is proposed, which divides the offline training task of security correction into two stages: in the first stage, the stacked auto-encoder (SAE) classification model is established, and the node correction state (0/1) output based on the fault information; in the second stage, the DNN learning model is established, and the correction amount of each action node is obtained based on the action nodes output in the previous stage. In this paper, the UPFC demonstration project of Nanjing West Ring Network is taken as a case study to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can fully meet the real-time security correction time requirements of power grids, and avoid the inherent defects of the traditional model method without an iterative solution and can also provide reasonable security correction strategies for N-1 and N-2 faults.

However, to adequately prepare students for today's world, it is also necessary to stimulate critical thinking and make them reflect on how to improve current practices using new tools and technologies. In this line, the main motivation of this research consists in exploring ways supported by technology to enhance the learning process of students and to better prepare them to face the challenges of today's world. To this end, the purpose of this work is to design an innovative learning project based on collaborative work among students, and research its impact in achieving better learning outcomes, generating of collective intelligence and further motivation. The proposed collaborative working model is based on peer review assessment methodology implemented through a learning web-platform. Thus, students were encouraged to peer review their classmates' works. They had to make comments, suggest improvements, and assess final assignments. Teaching staff managed and supervised the whole process. Students were selected from computer science engineering at the University of Alicante (Spain). Results suggested greater content assimilation and enhanced learning in several scientific skills. The students' final grade exceeded what any student could produce individually, but we cannot conclude that real collective intelligence was generated. Learning methodologies based on the possibilities of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide new ways to transmit and manage knowledge in higher education. Collaborating in peer assessment enhances the students' motivation and promotes the active learning. In addition, this method can be very helpful and time saving for instructors in the management of large groups.

AB  - The process of interpretation, and the ways in which knowledge builds upon interpretations, has profound implications in scientific and managerial terms. Despite the significance of these issues, geomorphologists typically give scant regard to such deliberations. Geomorphology is not a linear, cause-and-effect science. Inherent complexities and uncertainties prompt perceptions of the process of interpretation in geomorphology as a frustrating form of witchcraft or wizardry — a dark art. Alternatively, acknowledging such challenges recognises the fun to be had in puzzle-solving encounters that apply abductive reasoning to make sense of physical landscapes, seeking to generate knowledge with a reliable evidence base. Carefully crafted approaches to interpretation relate generalised understandings derived from analysis of remotely sensed data with field observations/measurements and local knowledge to support appropriately contextualised place-based applications. In this paper we develop a cognitive approach (Describe-Explain-Predict) to interpret landscapes. Explanation builds upon meaningful description, thereby supporting reliable predictions, in a multiple lines of evidence approach. Interpretation transforms data into knowledge to provide evidence that supports a particular argument. Examples from fluvial geomorphology demonstrate the data-interpretation-knowledge sequence used to analyse river character, behaviour and evolution. Although Big Data and machine learning applications present enormous potential to transform geomorphology into a data-rich, increasingly predictive science, we outline inherent dangers in allowing prescriptive and synthetic tools to do the thinking, as interpreting local differences is an important element of geomorphic enquiry.

(“Role of Artificial Intelligence Techniques ... - PubMed”) Physiotherapy is mainly involving in curing bone-related pain and injuries. The recent emergence of artificially intelligent machines has seen human cognitive capacity enhanced by computational agents that can recognize previously hidden patterns within massive data sets. (“(PDF) Artificial intelligence in clinical practice ...”) In this context, artificial intelligence in pediatric physiotherapy could be one of the most important modalities in delivering better medical and healthcare services to needy people. It is an attempt to identify the types, as well as to assess the effectiveness of interventions provided by artificial intelligence on pediatric physical therapy optimization-related outcomes. Methods: Data acquisition was carried out by systematic searches from various academic and research databases i.e., google scholar, PubMed, and IEEE from March 2011 to March 2021. Besides, numerous trial registries and grey literature resources were also explored. A total of 187 titles/abstracts were screened, and forty-eight full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Conclusions: This research describes some of the possible influences of artificial intelligence technologies on pediatric physiotherapy practice, and the subsequent ways in which physiotherapy education will need to change to graduate professionals who are fit for practice in the 21st century health system for promoting safe and effective use of artificial intelligence and the delivery of Pediatric Physical Therapy care to people.

AB  - Introduction
Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a well-documented aspect of social and interpersonal functioning, but the underlying neural mechanisms for this capacity remain poorly understood. Here we used advanced brain connectivity techniques to explore the associations between EI and effective connectivity (EC) within four functional brain networks.
Methods
The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) was used to collect EI data from 55 healthy individuals (mean age = 30.56±8.3 years, 26 males). The MSCEIT comprises two area cores – experiential EI (T1) and strategic EI (T2). The T1 core included two sub-scales – perception of emotions (S1) and using emotions to facilitate thinking (S2), and the T2 core included two sub-scales – understanding of emotions (S3) and management of emotions (S4). All participants underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) scans. The spectral dynamic causal modeling approach was implemented to estimate EC within four networks of interest – the default-mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), control-execution network (CEN) and salience network (SN). The strength of EC within each network was correlated with the measures of EI, with correlations at pFDR < 0.05 considered as significant.
Results
There was no significant association between any of the measures of EI and EC strength within the DMN and DAN. For CEN, however, we found that there were significant negative associations between EC strength from the right anterior prefrontal cortex (RAPFC) to the left anterior prefrontal cortex (LAPFC) and both S2 and T1, and significant positive associations between EC strength from LAPFC to RAPFC and S2. EC strength from the right superior parietal cortex (SPC) to RAPFC also showed significant negative association with S4 and T2. For the SN, S3 showed significant negative association with EC strength from the right insula to RAPFC and significant positive association with EC strength from the left insula to dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC).
Conclusions
We provide evidence that the negative ECs within the right hemisphere, and from the right to left hemisphere, and positive ECs within the left hemisphere and from the left to right hemisphere of CEN (involving bilateral frontal and right parietal region) and SN (involving right frontal, anterior cingulate and bilateral insula) play a significant role in regulating and processing emotions. These findings also suggest that measures of EC can be utilized as important biomarkers to better understand the underlying neural mechanisms of EI.

AB  - Living systems inhabit the area of the world which is shaped by the predictable space-time of physical objects and forces that can be incorporated into their perception pattern. The process of selecting a “habitable” space-time is the internal quantum measurement in which living systems become embedded into the environment that supports their living state. This means that living organisms choose a coordinate system in which the influence of measurement is minimal. We discuss specific roles of biological macromolecules, in particular of the cytoskeleton, in shaping perception patterns formed in the internal measurement process. Operation of neuron is based on the transmission of signals via cytoskeleton where the digital output is generated that can be decoded through a reflective action of the perceiving agent. It is concluded that the principle of optimality in biology as formulated by Liberman et al. (BioSystems 22, 135–154, 1989) is related to the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns that are maximally predictable and can hold the living state for a prolonged time. This is achieved by the selection of a habitable space approximated to the conditions described by classical physics.

AB  - Automatic grading is not a new approach but the need to adapt the latest technology to automatic grading has become very important. As the technology has rapidly became more powerful on scoring exams and essays, especially from the 1990s onwards, partially or wholly automated grading systems using computational methods have evolved and have become a major area of research. In particular, the demand of scoring of natural language responses has created a need for tools that can be applied to automatically grade these responses. In this paper, we focus on the concept of automatic grading of short answer questions such as are typical in the UK GCSE system, and providing useful feedback on their answers to students. We present experimental results on a dataset provided from the introductory computer science class in the University of North Texas. We first apply standard data mining techniques to the corpus of student answers for the purpose of measuring similarity between the student answers and the model answer. This is based on the number of common words. We then evaluate the relation between these similarities and marks awarded by scorers. We consider an approach that groups student answers into clusters. Each cluster would be awarded the same mark, and the same feedback given to each answer in a cluster. In this manner, we demonstrate that clusters indicate the groups of students who are awarded the same or the similar scores. Words in each cluster are compared to show that clusters are constructed based on how many and which words of the model answer have been used. The main novelty in this paper is that we design a model to predict marks based on the similarities between the student answers and the model answer. We argue that computational methods be used to enhance the reliability of human scoring, and not replace it. Humans are required to calibrate the system, and to deal with situations that are challenging. Computational methods can provide insight into which student answers will be found challenging and thus be a place human judgement is required.

AB  - Background
Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established clinical therapy, but an anatomically clear definition of the underlying neural target(s) of the stimulation remains elusive. Patient-specific models of DBS are commonly used tools in the search for stimulation targets, and recent iterations of those models are focused on characterizing the brain connections that are activated by DBS.
Objective
The goal of this study was to quantify axonal pathway activation in the subthalamic region from DBS at different electrode locations and stimulation settings.
Materials and Methods
We used an anatomically and electrically detailed computational model of subthalamic DBS to generate recruitment curves for eight different axonal pathways of interest, at three generalized DBS electrode locations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (ie, central STN, dorsal STN, posterior STN). These simulations were performed with three levels of DBS electrode localization uncertainty (ie, 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm).
Results
The recruitment curves highlight the diversity of pathways that are theoretically activated with subthalamic DBS, in addition to the dependence of the stimulation location and parameter settings on the pathway activation estimates. The three generalized DBS locations exhibited distinct pathway recruitment curve profiles, suggesting that each stimulation location would have a different effect on network activity patterns. We also found that the use of anodic stimuli could help limit activation of the internal capsule relative to other pathways. However, incorporating realistic levels of DBS electrode localization uncertainty in the models substantially limits their predictive capabilities.
Conclusions
Subtle differences in stimulation location and/or parameter settings can impact the collection of pathways that are activated during subthalamic DBS.

AB  - Implementing computational methods for preservation, inheritance, and promotion of Cultural Heritage (CH) has become a research trend across the world since the 1990s. In China, generations of scholars have dedicated themselves to studying the country’s rich CH resources; there are great potential and opportunities in the field of computational research on specific cultural artefacts or artforms. Based on previous works, this paper proposes a systematic framework for Chinese Cultural Heritage Computing that consists of three conceptual levels which are Chinese CH protection and development strategy, computing process, and computable cultural ecosystem. The computing process includes three modules: (1) data acquisition and processing, (2) digital modeling and database construction, and (3) data application and promotion. The modules demonstrate the computing approaches corresponding to different phases of Chinese CH protection and development, from digital preservation and inheritance to presentation and promotion. The computing results can become the basis for the generation of cultural genes and eventually the formation of computable cultural ecosystem Case studies on the Mogao caves in Dunhuang and the art of Guqin, recognized as world’s important tangible and intangible cultural heritage, are carried out to elaborate the computing process and methods within the framework. With continuous advances in data collection, processing, and display technologies, the framework can provide constructive reference for building up future research roadmaps in Chinese CH computing and related fields, for sustainable protection and development of Chinese CH in the digital age.

AB  - The emerging popularity of the nexus discussion reflects the ongoing transition from a sectoral or silo approach to an integrative approach to address the global challenges pertinent to the three essential resources: food, energy, and water (FEW). Cities are critically important for advancing regional sustainable development and are thus placed at the center of the FEW nexus. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review to debate the current concepts and methods of the FEW nexus at different scales, with the aim of developing a conceptual knowledgebase framework for scientific analysis and policy making associated with the urban FEW nexus. Although the concept of nexus thinking has been widely accepted, a consistent and explicit cognition of the FEW nexus is still lacking, and a sophisticated methodological modeling framework is urgently required at various scales. As such, we proposed a three-dimensional conceptual framework of the urban FEW nexus from the perspective of resource interdependency, resource provision and system integration. This framework is useful in steering the systematic modeling and integrative management of the complex nexus issues of urban systems with different perspectives. Finally, the future directions of urban nexus research are identified from four aspects, including systematic characterization, cross-region tele-connection mechanisms, co-decision model development, and governance transition.

AB  - Product design activities are predicated on fuzzy modelling, given that verbalising and interpreting engineering requirements are inherently fuzzy processes. The aim of this paper is to present a method for fuzzy intelligent requirement engineering from natural language to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. The field exploring the dynamics of computational processes from fuzzy linguistic modelling to fuzzy design modelling is complex and remains under-explored. No existing research has been identified which focuses specifically on fuzzy requirements engineering from natural language to CAD modelling. This paper seeks to address this by providing a design formalisation system based on five key principles. These principles are used to set out a computing procedure which follows a method broken up into six phases. The results of these six phases are fuzzy semantic graphs, which provide engineering requirements according to reliable design information. The approach is put into practice using the fuzzy agent-based tool developed by the authors, called F-EGEON (Fuzzy Engineering desiGn sEmantics elabOration and applicatioN). The proposed method is illustrated through an application from the automotive industry.

AB  - Planning decentralised community-level hybrid energy systems has emerged as a solution to the various environmental and economic issues associated with conventional centralised energy supply systems. However, the optimal planning of community energy systems is a challenging issue due to the complexities, uncertainties, conflicting objectives, and high computational times in analysis. This study introduces a new multi-objective model based on weighted goal programming and grey pairwise comparison to assess renewable energy-based strategies in the case of net-zero energy communities. The problem was formulated to determine the optimal energy mix based on minimization of life cycle impacts and costs and maximization of renewable contributions and operational energy savings. To this end, binary integer and continues variables were applied on the code developed in a CPLEX environment. A pairwise comparison based on grey numbers was used to find the impacts of the goals in the objective function of the model under uncertainty. In addition to the grey-based weighting scenario, different weighting scenarios were employed to consider the importance of all goals on the system. These weighting scenarios were used to investigate the effects of changing decision priorities on the outcomes and on stakeholder interests at different levels. The developed goal-programming model was applied to the data of a case example and solved based on the weighting scenarios. Results indicated that the model is capable of finding the best possible strategies with the lowest total undesirable deviations from the desired levels of the goals compared to the literature of the decision-making techniques. The integration of maximum renewable energy (RE) supply in the energy mix with the locally available energy resources can deliver considerable benefits in terms of energy supply cost reduction as well as in mitigating life cycle environmental impacts. When environmental goals are prioritized, integrating low emissions RE as much as possible and excluding waste-to-energy technologies makes best sense, while under a pro-economic perspective, solar integration is comparatively discouraged. The findings of the study are expected to assist community developers and other decision makers involved in regional energy planning. The developed method will also be of use for those who are interested in the use of goal programming to solve complex planning issues involving numerous uncertain parameters.

AB  - With the assistance of digital media, entertainment oriented E-learning models can effectively enhance students’ learning enthusiasm. This article analyzes the application of entertainment E-learning mode based on Apriori algorithm in intelligent English reading assistance mode. At present, English reading teaching faces some problems, such as outdated teaching methods, passive learning among students, excessive emphasis on imparting grammar knowledge while neglecting the improvement of students’ reading skills and strategies, and so on. Therefore, this article conducts research on intelligent English reading comprehension tools based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm. This paper proposes a recreational E-learning model based on Apriori algorithm. Based on Apriori algorithm, students’ interests and preferences on different learning resources and entertainment elements are mined and incorporated into the learning model design. Then, a set of entertaining English reading assistant model is designed, which uses a variety of entertainment elements, such as gamified learning, interactive activities and reward mechanism, to increase students’ learning participation and enthusiasm. This article adopts the idea of LSA algorithm to construct a BERT semantic analysis model. We treat nodes in the network as word items and then use singular value decomposition algorithm to decompose the word document matrix. Secondly, the original association rule Apriori algorithm was optimized, and the optimized association rule Apriori algorithm effectively solved the problem of excessive computation in traditional algorithms. Finally, based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm, this article designs an intelligent English reading comprehension tool, mainly analyzing the practical application of the system and greatly improving the efficiency of English reading teaching.

AB  - Mixed integer linear programming is one of the main approaches used to solve unit commitment problems. Due to the computational complexity of unit commitment problems, several researches remark the benefits of using less binary variables or relaxing them for the branch-and-cut algorithm. However, integrality constraints relaxation seems to be case dependent because there are many instances where applying it may not improve the computational burden. In addition, there is a lack of extensive numerical experiments evaluating the effects of the relaxation of binary variables in mixed integer linear programming based unit commitment. Therefore, the primary purpose of this work is to analyze the effects of binary variables and compare different relaxations, supported by extensive computational experiments. To accomplish this objective, two power systems are used for the numerical tests: the IEEE118 test system and a very large scale real system. The results suggest that a direct link between the relaxation of binary variables and computational burden cannot be easily assured in the general case. Therefore, relaxing binary variables should not be used as a general rule-of-practice to improve computational burden, at least, until each particular model is tested under different load scenarios and formulations to quantify the final effects of binary variables on the specific UC implementation. The secondary aim of this work is to give some preliminary insight into the reasons that could be supporting the binary relaxation in some UC instances.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in emotional processes in cognitive science, theories on emotion regulation have remained rather isolated, predominantly focused on cognitive regulation strategies such as reappraisal. However, recent neurocognitive evidence suggests that early emotion regulation may involve sensorimotor control in addition to other emotion-regulation processes. We propose an action-oriented view of emotion regulation, in which feedforward predictions develop from action-selection mechanisms. Those can account for acute emotional-action control as well as more abstract instances of emotion regulation such as cognitive reappraisal. We argue the latter occurs in absence of overt motor output, yet in the presence of full-blown autonomic, visceral, and subjective changes. This provides an integrated framework with testable neuro-computational predictions and concrete starting points for intervention to improve emotion control in affective disorders.

AB  - By taking into account Bruce Bridgeman's interest in an evolutionary framing of human cognition, we examine effective (cause-and-effect) connectivity among cortical structures related to different parts of the triune phylogenetic stratification: archicortex, paleocortex and neocortex. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 healthy subjects and spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling, we report interactions among 10 symmetrical left and right brain areas. Our results testify to general rightward and top-down biases in excitatory interactions of these structures during resting state, when self-related contemplation prevails over more objectified conceptual thinking. The right hippocampus is the only structure that shows bottom-up excitatory influences extending to the frontopolar cortex. The right ventrolateral cortex also plays a prominent role as it interacts with the majority of nodes within and between evolutionary distinct brain subdivisions. These results suggest the existence of several levels of cognitive-affective organization in the human brain and their profound lateralization.

Computational technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) seemed to become ubiquitous in 2020 and have been increasingly applied as scientists worked from home and were separated from the laboratory and their colleagues. This shift may be more permanent as the future of molecule design across different industries will increasingly require machine learning models for design and optimization of molecules as they become “designed by AI”. AI and machine learning has essentially become a commodity within the pharmaceutical industry. This perspective will briefly describe our personal opinions of how machine learning has evolved and is being applied to model different molecule properties that crosses industries in their utility and ultimately suggests the potential for tight integration of AI into equipment and automated experimental pipelines. It will also describe how many groups have implemented generative models covering different architectures, for de novo design of molecules. We also highlight some of the companies at the forefront of using AI to demonstrate how machine learning has impacted and influenced our work. Finally, we will peer into the future and suggest some of the areas that represent the most interesting technologies that may shape the future of molecule design, highlighting how we can help increase the efficiency of the design-make-test cycle which is currently a major focus across industries.

AB  - Residential heating displays huge decarbonisation potential towards Net-Zero. The complexity of heating system and socio-economic system appeals for a systematic design to avoid exacerbating fuel poverty. This study develops a three-layer heat-for-all model which integrates building stocks analysis, distributed heating system optimisation, economic and environmental impacts simulation to tackle heating decarbonisation and fuel poverty simultaneously. This whole system model is a powerful decision support tool that can help conceive heating decarbonisation strategies for wider regions and countries. More than 400,000 scenarios are created, considering the effects of future policy schemes (No Grant, Business as Usual, Proposed), minimum emission reduction target, carbon intensity of grid, future natural gas, and electricity prices. Results show that optimised heating system decarbonisation plan heavily relies on future energy prices. In the case study, only air source heat pumps are chosen when electricity price is lower than 3 times gas price. Secondly, investment in heating system could stimulate the greenhouse gas emission of whole supply chain, hedging the emission reduction achieved in heating system. This further reveals that life cycle thinking is imperative in GHG emission mitigation. Thirdly, electricity decarbonisation plays a vital role in achieving whole system emission reduction. The grid carbon intensity reduction makes substantial contribution to the emission reduction of heating system and industry system. In tackling fuel poverty, it's worth noticing that the fuel poverty is aggravated with more grant support under certain scenarios, since current policy schemes focus on capital investment in heating system but overlook the increased energy bills. It appeals for a more comprehensive policy design considering all stakeholders.

AB  - Pragmatics is the study of human language use as it is exercised in a community of social practice. The exercise is, however, not limited to verbal signs: other communicative means are also included under the definition (e.g., as becomes clear when one studies pragmatic acts in addition to the traditional speech acts). In addition, emphasis is placed on the way communication is organized, first of all in the classical models put forward by Austin, Searle, and Grice, but extending also this approach to comprise more recent advances in pragmatic thinking, especially in relation to what used to be called the hyphenated disciplines: sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, the study of humans in interaction with computers, the teaching of first and second languages, and a host of other practically and theoretically oriented fields of study.

AB  - Today energy recovery using Micro-Hydropowers (MHPs) in Water Distribution Networks (WDN) is a well-known approach for recycling the wasted energy in infrastructures as a sample of circular economy. Likewise, in this study for the first time a framework for evaluation of WDN for energy harvesting have been designed with the application of statistical optimization, simulation, and artificial intelligence concepts. In this study, after modelling a WDN in Mashhad, Iran, with Environmental Protection Agency Network Evaluation Tool (EPANET) software, the potential of energy recovery using MHP technology was optimized with the application of Design of Experiment (DOE) methods, including Taguchi and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and then the model prediction ability was improved by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. Results of this investigation revealed that the combination of Taguchi and RSM methods could successfully optimize the energy recovery potential with consideration of improving the hydraulic parameters of WDN. With the application of RSM and Taguchi, high potential positions for MHP placement are detected and analyzed based on a high-performance operational decision-making methodology. According to Artificial Intelligence (AI) computations, energy harvesting and hydraulic responses can be estimated with more than a 99 % correlation coefficient. Also, it shows that the soft-operator can be executed to control the features of MHPs in WDNs. The outputs of this research demonstrated that MHP harvested energy is more than 400KW for the run time of this study with consideration of hydraulic parameters.

AB  - Brain science accelerates the study of intelligence and behavior, contributes fundamental insights into human cognition, and offers prospective treatments for brain disease. Faced with the challenges posed by imaging technologies and deep learning computational models, big data and high-performance computing (HPC) play essential roles in studying brain function, brain diseases, and large-scale brain models or connectomes. We review the driving forces behind big data and HPC methods applied to brain science, including deep learning, powerful data analysis capabilities, and computational performance solutions, each of which can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy and research output. This work reinforces predictions that big data and HPC will continue to improve brain science by making ultrahigh-performance analysis possible, by improving data standardization and sharing, and by providing new neuromorphic insights.
