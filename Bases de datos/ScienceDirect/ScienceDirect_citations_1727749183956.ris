AB  - This parallel randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) focused on repetitive negative thinking (RNT) versus a waitlist control (WLC) in improving interpersonal skills in adolescents with problems of social and school adaptation. Forty-two adolescents (11–17 years) agreed to participate. Participants were allocated through simple randomization to the intervention condition or the waitlist control condition. The intervention was a 3-session, group-based, RNT-focused ACT protocol. The primary outcome was the performance on a test of interpersonal skills (Interpersonal Conflict Resolution Assessment, ESCI). At posttreatment, repeated measures ANOVA showed that the intervention was efficacious in increasing overall interpersonal skills (d = 2.62), progress in values (d = 1.23), and reducing emotional symptoms (d = 0.98). No adverse events were found. A brief RNT-focused ACT intervention was highly efficacious in improving interpersonal skills and reducing emotional symptoms in adolescents.

AB  - This paper looks at peace with an integrated perspective. As a state, peace cannot be measured directly and requires the use of proxies and indicators. This paper revisits the positive peace index (PPI) introduced by the Institute for Economy and Peace (IEP) through the lens of systems thinking and modeling. Three sets of systems tools (cross-impact analysis, network analysis, and system dynamics) are proposed to explicitly account for the different levels of influence and dependence among the eight domains used to determine the PPI at the country level. Although more comprehensive than the original IEP formulation, the integrated approach proposed herein requires decisionmakers to be systems thinkers and able to conduct a detailed analysis of how the eight domains influence (impact) or depend on (sensitive to) each other. The proposed approach allows decisionmakers to capture the multidimensional and cross-disciplinary nature of positive peace better. This paper also shows that the three components of peace (positive, negative, and cultural) initially proposed by Johan Galtung can be represented using three-dimensional geometric features.

AB  - Thermochemical conversion technologies are emerging as preferred resource recovery practices for managing animal manure in agricultural regions. Although the implementation of such technologies has been previously studied, difficulties exist in maintaining balance between high rate of resource recovery and low environmental, economic, and social impacts, particularly in rural regions with limited resources. We developed a data-driven framework by integrating machine learning with life cycle thinking that can be used as an open-source tool to help overcome these barriers. The framework was applied to compare two emerging technologies: pyrolysis versus hydrothermal carbonization for managing the excess poultry litter in a rural agricultural region. Among different machine learning models, random forest regression was the most successful to predict resource recovery of both technologies. Next, sustainability analysis indicated that the environmental (global warming), economic (annual worth), and social (system intrusiveness) impacts of pyrolysis was lower than hydrothermal carbonization. Finally, the framework revealed that implementation of pyrolysis at 600 °C for 1 h with the heating rate of 20 °C/min would result in the highest rate of resource recovery that corresponded to the lowest impacts. These results can be helpful in providing operational conditions for implementing emerging resource recovery technologies in rural agricultural regions.

Cognitive studies are also significant in the research about design studio. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of designers intelligence quotient (IQ) on their designs. The statistical population in this study consisted of all Deylaman Institute of Higher Education architecture graduate students enrolled in 2011. Sixty of these students were selected via simple random sampling based on the finite population sample size calculation formula. The students’ IQ was measured using Raven’s Progressive Matrices. The students’ scores in Architecture Design Studio (ADS) courses from first grade (ADS-1) to fifth grade (ADS-5) and the mean scores of the design courses were used in determining the students’ design ability. Inferential statistics, as well as correlation analysis and mean comparison test for independent samples with SPSS, were also employed to analyze the research data. Results indicated that the students’ IQ, ADS-1 to ADS-4 scores, and the mean scores of the students’ design courses were not significantly correlated. By contrast, the students’ IQ and ADS-5 scores were significantly correlated. As the complexity of the design problem and designers’ experience increased, the effect of IQ on design seemingly intensified.

AB  - Background and aim:
In recent days, the research on student’s intelligence level modelling is a challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) task, which gains more attraction because it provides actionable insights to the tutor by analysing the intelligence level of the learners. Each learner’s knowledge, comprehension, and intellectual capacities are unique. It is critical to identify these capacities and provide learners, particularly slow learners, with the necessary knowledge. Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is an essential component for assessing the knowledge level of students. The reasoning level or coefficient deals with the analysis of the thinking capability in a logical way. It also reflects the child’s learning potential. The main aim of the proposed system is to design a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model (CKRM), which fuses Cognitive Performance Metrics (CPM) calculation and Reasoning Coefficient Calculation (RCC) algorithms to assess the student’s intelligence level. The result of the proposed system is stratification of students to three different ranges of reasoning coefficient.
Methods:
The CKRM consists of the following phases: data collection, statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building and analysis, which involve the assessment of the knowledge level using CPT and calculation of reasoning coefficient using First Order Logic (FOL), and finally model evaluation using cognitive evaluation metrics. CPM and RCC algorithms have been proposed in this paper to calculate the student’s reasoning coefficient by using the forward chaining FOL inference engine. The dataset is a real time data which consists of the academic and cognitive performance details of school students from classes 1 to 6 for the year 2019 to 2020. The academic data are collected from the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) maintained by the school. The cognitive performance data are collected by conducting the tests for the students using the memory training application called Lumosity.
Results:
The proposed system’s performance is evaluated using ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in which the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis achieved an accuracy of 0.97 for classes 1, 2, and 3. For classes 4, 5, and 6, nearly twelve ML algorithms are evaluated in which Random Forest (RF) Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.98. Six math expert committee teachers concluded that the reasoning coefficient value was acceptable with an average accuracy of 0.92 for classes 1, 2, 3 and 0.9 for classes 4, 5, 6. In comparison to the pre-existing models employed in the prior research, it was determined that the created CKRM (academic and cognitive) was superior. The cognitive metrics such as taskability, Response Time (RT), knowledge capacity and utilization has also been evaluated. The average values of taskability, RT, knowledge capacity and knowledge utilization are 0.85, 0.81, 0.55, and 0.44.
Conclusion:
The ultimate goal is to make customized teaching easier; hence, this article involves determining a student’s cognitive level by estimating their reasoning coefficient. The suggested approach analyses and categorizes students’ cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, thinking, and logical reasoning, using three different reasoning coefficients. This approach assists teachers in determining the degree of intelligence of their students.

AB  - COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. With half of the world's countries in lockdown as of April due to this pandemic, monitoring and understanding the spread of the virus and infection rates and how these factors relate to behavioural and societal parameters is crucial for developing control strategies. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of masks, social distancing, lockdown and self-isolation for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our findings from an agent-based simulation modelling showed that whilst requiring a lockdown is widely believed to be the most efficient method to quickly reduce infection numbers, the practice of social distancing and the usage of surgical masks can potentially be more effective than requiring a lockdown. Our multivariate analysis of simulation results using the Morris Elementary Effects Method suggests that if a sufficient proportion of the population uses surgical masks and follows social distancing regulations, then SARS-CoV-2 infections can be controlled without requiring a lockdown.

AB  - Globular PDZ domains typically serve as protein–protein interaction modules that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions via recognition of short linear motifs (SLiMs). Often, PDZ mediated-interactions are essential components of macromolecular complexes, and disruption affects the entire scaffold. Due to their roles as linchpins in trafficking and signaling pathways, PDZ domains are attractive targets: both for controlling viral pathogens, which bind PDZ domains and hijack cellular machinery, as well as for developing therapies to combat human disease. However, successful therapeutic interventions that avoid off-target effects are a challenge, because each PDZ domain interacts with a number of cellular targets, and specific binding preferences can be difficult to decipher. Over twenty-five years of research has produced a wealth of data on the stereochemical preferences of individual PDZ proteins and their binding partners. Currently the field lacks a central repository for this information. Here, we provide this important resource and provide a manually curated, comprehensive list of the 271 human PDZ domains. We use individual domain, as well as recent genomic and proteomic, data in order to gain a holistic view of PDZ domains and interaction networks, arguing this knowledge is critical to optimize targeting selectivity and to benefit human health.

AB  - A quantity value, such as 5 kg, consists of a number and a reference (often an International System of Units (SI) unit) that together express the magnitude of a quantity. Many software libraries, packages, and ontologies that implement “quantities and units” functions are available. Although all of them begin with SI and associated practices, they differ in how they address issues such as ad hoc counting units, ratios of two quantities of the same kind, and uncertainty. This short article describes an architecture that addresses the complete set of functions in a simple and consistent fashion. Its goal is to encourage more convergent thinking about the functions and the underlying concepts so that the many disparate implementations, present and future, will become more consistent with one another.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the logical, historical and computational approaches to the philosophy of science. It discusses how the logical approach to philosophy of science was introduced by the Vienna Circle, and developed by them and their followers and associates. The logical approach to philosophy of science remained the dominant subject throughout the 1950s; but, from the early 1960s, it was challenged by a striking development of the historical approach. The historical approach was not introduced for the ﬁrst time in the 1960s. On the contrary, it had been developed by Mach and Duhem much earlier. Although, Mach and Duhem are cited by the Vienna Circle as important inﬂuences on their philosophy, the Vienna Circle did not adopt the historical features of these two thinkers. In the excitement generated by the new logic of Frege and Russell, history of science seems to have been temporarily forgotten. The general idea of the historical approach is not new in the 1960s, however, that decade saw striking developments in this approach. After Kuhn, the analysis of scientiﬁc revolutions became a major problem for philosophy of science, while Lakatos applied the historical approach to mathematics for the ﬁrst time.

AB  - Regarding the massive sustainability challenge mankind is currently facing, there is an indisputable need to implement sustainability as the key reference point into higher engineering education in order to prepare the stakeholders of tomorrow. This requires networked thinking on the part of the learner and increases the learning goals’ complexity dramatically. The actual achieved learning outcomes are often evaluated by assessing factual knowledge in higher education. However, it has been shown many times that students choose the examination format for orientation when studying. Thus, the authors propose a gamified summative assessment approach that requires networked thinking to direct students’ learning efforts towards broad competency building. In a study with 25 students of a master engineering course, the effects of a gamified examination design are investigated.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic-driven financial crisis grew significant interest among firms to adopt supply chain finance (SCF) to optimize working capital for the financial stability of the supply chain. However, it is impractical for firms with a diverse and extensive supplier base to strategize the SCF solutions for individual suppliers by assessing their financial risk. Hence, this study conceptualizes an intelligent method to demonstrate how supplier segmentation based on suppliers’ payment risk portfolios helps supply chain practitioners to assess suppliers’ financial risk and strategize manageable supply chain finance solutions for them. This method employs a stochastic optimization model to compute suppliers’ optimum payment risk portfolios and generate a supplier segmentation matrix to offer supply chain practitioners the cognitive ability to select appropriate SCF solutions for their suppliers. The proposed method can be implemented into an AI-driven explainable recommendation system to aid supply chain practitioners in applying smart strategic thinking in supply chain finance decision-making.

AB  - The demand to satisfy environmental and economic performance requirements of buildings highlights the application of the responsive skin facades in offering superior performance, as compared to conventional façades. With this respect, responsive skins have become a growing field of research during the recent decade while a thorough review of studies investigating their design and technology aspects is still missing. To fill the identified gap, this study aims to present a systematic literature review and state of the art in an untouched research area of the responsive skins, integrated with their geometric and mechanism design approaches. To this end, a total of 89 studies, collected from two major bibliographic databases of Scopus and Google Scholar from the first of 2010 to the mid of 2021, were reviewed and several classifications and analyses on the associated design thinking, skin systems and responsive mechanisms were presented. The gap analysis of the findings indicates that the lack of controllable substitution design for mechanical skins is one of the reasons preventing the application of responsive skins in construction industry. Furthermore, the gap between simulation and constructability and the relationship between the designed skin geometry with climatic analysis and performance provide basis for future studies.

AB  - Intention recognition is one of the core components of mindreading, an important process in social cognition. Human beings, from age of 18months, have been shown to be able to extrapolate intentions from observed actions, even when the performer failed at achieving the goal. Existing accounts of intention recognition emphasize the use of an intent (plan) library, which is matched against observed actions for recognition. These therefore cannot account for recognition of failed sequences of actions, nor novel actions. In this paper, we begin to tackle these open questions by examining computational models for components of human intention recognition, which emphasize the ability of humans to detect and identify intentions in a sequence of observed actions, based solely on the rationality of movement (its efficiency). We provide a high-level overview of intention recognition as a whole, and then elaborate on two components of the model, which we believe to be at its core, namely, those of intention detection and intention prediction. By intention detection we mean the ability to discern whether a sequence of actions has any underlying intention at all, or whether it was performed in an arbitrary manner with no goal in mind. By intention prediction we mean the ability to extend an incomplete sequence of actions to its most likely intended goal. We evaluate the model, and these two components, in context of existing literature, and in a number of experiments with more than 140 human subjects. For intention detection, our model was able to attribute high levels of intention to those traces perceived by humans as intentional, and vice versa. For intention prediction as well, our model performed in a way that closely matched that of humans. The work highlights the intimate relationship between the ability to generate plans, and the ability to recognize intentions.

The main findings of this study are that (1) research on musical creativity has undergone an incipient phase and has had a growing scientific interest since the mid-2000s, (2) musical creativity is a relatively more specific research field compared to general creativity research that has been represented by more specific sub-fields, e.g., music psychology and ethnomusicology, (3) a small number of scholars – especially from the USA, England, Russia, Spain, Australia, and some countries from South Europe – have made the more impactful contribution as regards musical creativity, (4) there is a small number of research collaborations among scholars, yet the collaborative networks among countries and institutions occur intercontinentally, (5) musical creativity research is growing with cross-disciplinary links with several branches of psychology, neurosciences, cognitive sciences, education, sociology, arts and humanities, and computer sciences, and (6) eight main topical foci have been founded in the literature from 1990 to date – i.e., computational creativity, processes of improvisation, improvisation teaching and learning, interactions/collaboration during improvisation, effects of improvisation practice, innovative music technology, esthetic aspect of everyday creativity, and music therapy. Further research on musical creativity could map the literature by focusing on contextual themes.

AB  - One cognitive process that impacts dieters’ decision to indulge is the activation of compensatory beliefs. Compensatory beliefs (CBs) are convictions that the consequences of engaging in an indulgent behaviour (eating cake) can be neutralized by the effects of another behaviour (skipping dinner). Using experience sampling methodology, this study hypothesized that, in addition to the cognitive processes associated with restraint and disinhibition, compensatory thinking contributes to the prediction of caloric intake. Results indicated that higher scores on CB, CI and TFEQ-D predicted a greater number of portions eaten signifying that, along with disinhibition, compensatory thinking predicts caloric intake in dieters.

AB  - This study presents the structure of a strategic crisis management model, considering the context and characteristics of a Brazilian community college. Strategic crisis management associated with coordination and control mechanisms theoretically underpinned the problem under study. It is a single case study, with grounded theory as the strategy for data treatment and content analysis to interpret and present the findings. In the model, the strategic and tactical stages systematized the dynamics of crisis management in a coordinated manner. Strategic crisis management was considered a continuous process rather than a strictly punctual one. The dynamism of the model's operationalization considered some premises that guided the behavior of the leadership and the crisis management team: i) pragmatic strategic thinking shaped by rationality; ii) quick responses in facing the crisis; iii) simplicity in actions; iv) reversible decisions susceptible to flexibilization; v) creativity and boldness to innovate and set new standards; v) collaboration for common causes.

AB  - Solar energy is the most important source of thermal energy that comes from the sun. This kind of energy has enormous potential applications in fields of technology such as photovoltaic panels, renewable power, solar light poles, and solar pumps used for water extraction. The era in which we are living is all about the applications of solar energy in industrial sectors most importantly in solar sports car manufacturing. This article presents a new way of thinking about the heat transport analyses of photovoltaic hybrid vehicles, by factoring Casson-Sutterby liquid with the inclusion of various effects like variable thermal conduction, thermal radiation, heat generation, and tetrahybrid nanoparticles. To solve the modelled equations in regards to both momentum and energy, another well-computational approach known as the Cash and Carp method was used. The effects of a wide variety of factors on temperature, shear stress, and velocity fields, as well as the surface drag coefficient and Nusselt number, are briefly described and illustrated in the form of tables and figures. It then found that the thermal radiation, heat production, and thermal conductivity parameters and insertion of agglomerative tetrhybrid nanoparticles in the base fluid amplify heat transfer rate, it has been shown that the performance of the solar car increases in terms of heat transition. In comparison to standard nanofluid, tetrahybrid nanofluid is the most effective medium for the transmission of heat. From the regression analysis, it is observed that the error in terms of Nusselt number is smaller 0.0151 for the case ε=1.5, and increases to 0.0151 in the case of ε=2.5. Relative percentage error is smaller 4.62% in the case of heat generation Q=0.7 but a maximum of 15.8% in the case of thermal radiation Rd=2.

AB  - A conventional collaborative beamforming (CB) system suffers from high sidelobes due to the random positioning of the nodes. This paper introduces a hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm called the Particle Swarm Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm-Explore (PSOGSA-E) to suppress the peak sidelobe level (PSL) in CB, by the means of finding the best weight for each node. The proposed algorithm combines the local search ability of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) with the social thinking skills of the legacy particle swarm optimization (PSO) and allows exploration to avoid premature convergence. The proposed algorithm also simplifies the cost of variable parameter tuning compared to the legacy optimization algorithms. Simulations show that the proposed PSOGSA-E outperforms the conventional, the legacy PSO, GSA and PSOGSA optimized collaborative beamformer by obtaining better results faster, producing up to 100% improvement in PSL reduction when the disk size is small.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore factors causing failures in innovative thought processes in engineering design. An innovation process is here understood as a complex and multi-phased thinking and problem solving process generating new and mostly unforeseeable solutions. The phases are partly overlapping and simultaneous. This complicated nature of innovation process demands a lot from innovation management, and thus it is not unusual that innovation processes fail. Identifying problems and shortcomings is important because it helps organizations to eliminate them in the future. This study focus on thought processes of individual participants in an innovation process, which is referred by us as microinnovation approach. This approach understands innovations as being based on human thinking.This study shows that factors related to knowledge, management and interaction are causing failures in engineering design. We found haste to be the most common reason for failures. Other contributing factors were lack of long-term thinking and inability to understand others’ perspective.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a revolutionary impact on our societies. It is helping humans in facing the global challenges of this century. Traditionally, AI is developed in software or through neuromorphic engineering in hardware. More recently, a brand-new strategy has been proposed. It is the so-called Chemical AI (CAI), which exploits molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry in wetware to mimic human intelligence. In this work, two promising approaches for boosting CAI are described. One regards designing and implementing neural surrogates that can communicate through optical or chemical signals and give rise to networks for computational purposes and to develop micro/nanorobotics. The other approach concerns “bottom-up synthetic cells” that can be exploited for applications in various scenarios, including future nano-medicine. Both topics are presented at a basic level, mainly to inform the broader audience of non-specialists, and so favour the rise of interest in these frontier subjects.

KW  - Natural language processing
AB  - Civil court view generation (CCVG) is a novel but important task for legal intelligence that aims to automatically generate a judge’s opinion based on the plaintiff’s claims and fact descriptions to interpret the judgment result. The task is more challenging than criminal court view generation as the latter generates views based only on criminal facts as input, whereas the CCVG must consider both the plaintiff’s claims and civil facts under the principle of “no claim, no trial.” However, current approaches still follow criminal domain practices to solve problems in civil cases. Moreover, the explicit modeling of the potential correspondence between claims and facts has often been neglected, as court views are required to respond to each corresponding claim based on factual evidence. To address the issues, we propose a dual path interaction network augmented by two self-supervised auxiliary tasks (named DuaPIN), which follows a bionic design by simulating the thinking logic of judges when writing opinions. Specifically, we construct a structurally symmetric Transformer-based dual path multi-encoder–decoder model such that the two inputs, claim and fact, contribute equally to the generation of civil court views. Moreover, an auxiliary task enhanced (ATE) training paradigm using multiple DuaPIN decoders is proposed to explicitly model the potential correspondence between claims and facts. Extensive experiments on public legal document dataset demonstrated that DuaPIN achieves competitive performance compared with previous methods and offers certain performance improvements to popular pre-trained language models via the ATE training method.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter introduces some of the vocabulary and concepts used in designing computer systems. It also introduces the “systems perspective,” a way of thinking about systems that is global and encompassing rather than focused on particular issues. The usual course of study of computer science and engineering begins with linguistic constructs for describing computations (software) and physical constructs for realizing computations (hardware). To develop applications that have these requirements, the designer must look beyond the software and hardware and view the computer system as a whole. In doing so, the designer encounters many new problems—so many that the limit on the scope of computer systems generally arises neither from laws of physics nor from theoretical impossibility, but rather from limitations of human understanding.

AB  - Philosophical work on values in science is held back by widespread ambiguity about how values bear on scientific choices. Here, I disambiguate several ways in which a choice can be value-laden and show that this disambiguation has the potential to solve and dissolve philosophical problems about values in science. First, I characterize four ways in which values relate to choices: values can motivate, justify, cause, or be impacted by the choices we make. Next, I put my proposed taxonomy to work, using it to clarify one version of the argument from inductive risk. The claim that non-epistemic values must play a role in scientific choices that run inductive risk makes most sense as a claim about values being needed to justify such choices. The argument from inductive risk is not unique: many philosophical arguments about values in science can be more clearly understood and assessed by paying close attention to how values and choices are related.

AB  - Dementia is a major neurocognitive disease which affects memory, thinking skills, attitudes, and social behavior, extremely causing disturbances in daily routine activities and social activities. Alzheimer is the most general form of dementia in the elderly. Recently, biomotivated techniques have become famous in the domain of healthcare and have obtained appreciable success. This review shows that these techniques are mostly utilized to resolve various problems such as image segmentation, feature selection, classification, and optimization in the detection of various disorders like cancer, anemia, Alzheimer, kidney and skin diseases. It is observed that the dementia diagnosis was performed using classical approaches which led to reduced performance (accuracy, precision). This performance parameter can be enhanced by using biomotivated techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the different role of biomotivated metaheuristics in the domain of dementia diagnosis with a detailed analysis of published work. The results showed that a biomotivated technique plays an important role in dementia diagnosis.

AB  - Leaders and their employees must navigate competing yet interrelated demands and processes when developing and implementing creative ideas. They have to engage in divergent and convergent thinking, challenge existing assumptions and accept them, plan and persist while remaining spontaneous and adaptive. We explore how, why, and when adopting a paradox approach to navigating such tensions enhances creativity and innovation. Rather than seeking to eliminate the discomfort associated with tensions by prioritizing one demand or process over the other, the paradox approach sees tensions as an opportunity for growth and learning. When adopting a paradox approach, people feel comfortable with the discomfort as tensions arise and recognize that by engaging in one process they enable the seemingly opposing process. We review research on paradoxical frames, mindset, and leadership, and offer a comprehensive theoretical model that delineates the related cognitive, affective, motivational, and social pathways, as well as contextual and cultural boundary conditions. We conclude by identifying promising future directions for research.

AB  - Specific environmental features, such as natural settings or spatial design, can foster creativity. The effect of object-context congruency on creativity has not yet been investigated. While congruence between an object and its visual context provides meaning to the object, it may hamper creativity due to mental fixation effects. In the current study, virtual reality technology (VR) was employed to examine the hypothesis that people display more cognitive flexibility - a key element of creativity, representing the ability to overcome mental fixation - when thinking about an object while being in an incongruent than in a congruent environment. Participants (N = 184) performed an Alternative Uses Task, in which they had to name as many uses for a book as possible, while being immersed in a virtual environment that was either object-context congruent (i.e., places where you would expect a book; e.g., a library or a living room; n = 91) or object-context incongruent (i.e., places where a book is not expected; e.g., a clothing store or a car workshop; n = 93). The effect of object (in)congruency was also assessed for three other indices of creativity: fluency (i.e., the number of ideas generated), originality and usefulness. In line with our hypothesis, participants scored higher on pure cognitive flexibility in the object-context incongruent than in the object-context congruent environment. Moreover, participants in the object-context incongruent environment condition generated more original ideas. The theoretical and practical implications of the current findings are discussed.

AB  - With increasing recognition of the roles RNA molecules and RNA/protein complexes play in an unexpected variety of biological processes, understanding of RNA structure–function relationships is of high current importance. To make clean biological interpretations from three-dimensional structures, it is imperative to have high-quality, accurate RNA crystal structures available, and the community has thoroughly embraced that goal. However, due to the many degrees of freedom inherent in RNA structure (especially for the backbone), it is a significant challenge to succeed in building accurate experimental models for RNA structures. This chapter describes the tools and techniques our research group and our collaborators have developed over the years to help RNA structural biologists both evaluate and achieve better accuracy. Expert analysis of large, high-resolution, quality-conscious RNA datasets provides the fundamental information that enables automated methods for robust and efficient error diagnosis in validating RNA structures at all resolutions. The even more crucial goal of correcting the diagnosed outliers has steadily developed toward highly effective, computationally based techniques. Automation enables solving complex issues in large RNA structures, but cannot circumvent the need for thoughtful examination of local details, and so we also provide some guidance for interpreting and acting on the results of current structure validation for RNA.

AB  - Reflection is widely acknowledged as a crucial skill for successful learning and decision-making. Recent evidence has shown that reflection can enhance motivation for in-depth learning, improve cognitive and metacognitive strategies, and promote self-regulated learning. While some studies have reported the positive effects of reflective interventions on student academic outcomes, conflicting findings exist. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of reflective interventions on academic achievement, this meta-analysis synthesized data from 25 quantitative studies (comprising 29 effect sizes) conducted between 2012 and 2022, with a total of 2,111 participants. The results revealed a significant overall effect of reflective interventions on academic achievement (g = 0.793, p < 0.001). Further moderator analyses indicated that the effectiveness of reflective interventions was influenced by factors such as learning mode, intervention duration, the role of reflective writing, and culture. However, education level, discipline, teacher or expert feedback, peer interaction, and technological scaffolding did not significantly affect the impact of reflective interventions across studies. These findings highlight the importance of fostering reflective thinking and refining the detailed design of reflective interventions to enhance students’ academic achievement.

AB  - Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) uses wireless radio frequency technology to automatically identify tagged objects. Despite the extensive development of RFID technology, tag collisions still remains a major drawback. The collision issue can be solved by using anti-collision techniques. While existing research has focused on improving anti-collision methods alone, it is also essential that a suitable type of anti-collision algorithm is selected for the specific circumstance. In this work, we evaluate anti-collision techniques and perform a comparative analysis in order to find the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. To identify the best anti-collision selection method in various scenarios, we have proposed two strategies for selective anti-collision technique management: a “Novel Decision Tree Strategy” and a “Six Thinking Hats Strategy”. We have shown that the selection of the correct technique for specific scenarios improve the quality of the data collection which, in turn, will increase the integrity of the data after being transformed, aggregated, and used for event processing.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly impacting various aspects of our daily lives, including education. With the rise of digital technologies, higher education has also been experiencing a transformation, and AI has been playing a crucial role in this transformation. The application of AI in higher education has been rapidly increasing, with a focus on improving student engagement, increasing efficiency, and enhancing the learning experience. The use of AI in higher education is not without its challenges and ethical considerations. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring the accuracy and fairness of AI algorithms, as well as avoiding potential biases. In addition, there are concerns about the privacy of student data, as well as the potential for AI to replace human instructors and support staff. Another challenge is ensuring that AI is used in a way that supports the overall goals of higher education, such as promoting critical thinking and creativity, rather than just being used as a tool for automating tasks and increasing efficiency. In this article, we will discuss the various ways in which AI is being applied in higher education where a proposed model for improving the cognitive capability of students is proposed and compared to other existing algorithms. It will be shown that the proposed model shows better performance compared to other models.

AB  - Periodic signals called Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) are elicited in the brain by flickering stimuli. They are usually detected by means of regression techniques that need relatively long trial lengths to provide feedback and/or sufficient number of calibration trials to be reliably estimated in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI). Thus, for BCI systems designed to operate with SSVEP signals, reliability is achieved at the expense of speed or extra recording time. Furthermore, regardless of the trial length, calibration free regression-based methods have been shown to suffer from significant performance drops when cognitive perturbations are present affecting the attention to the flickering stimuli. In this study we present a novel technique called Oscillatory Source Tensor Discriminant Analysis (OSTDA) that extracts oscillatory sources and classifies them using the newly developed tensor-based discriminant analysis with shrinkage. The proposed approach is robust for small sample size settings where only a few calibration trials are available. Besides, it works well with both low- and high-number-of-channel settings, using trials as short as one second. OSTDA performs similarly or significantly better than other three benchmarked state-of-the-art techniques under different experimental settings, including those with cognitive disturbances (i.e. four datasets with control, listening, speaking and thinking conditions). Overall, in this paper we show that OSTDA is the only pipeline among all the studied ones that can achieve optimal results in all analyzed conditions.

AB  - As a large number of renewable energy resources are connected to power systems, the operation, planning, and optimization of power systems have been becoming more and more complex. Power flow calculation, unit commitment, economic dispatch, energy pricing, and power system planning are essentially computation problems. A lot of computing resources are required for these problems, which are non-trivial, especially for large-scale power systems with the high penetration of renewable energy. Traditionally, the calculation and optimization of power systems are completed by classical computers based on the classical computing theory and the von Neumann architecture. However, with Moore’s law getting closer and closer to the limit, the importance of quantum computing has become increasingly prominent. Quantum computing has been applied to some fields to a certain extent, yet the applications of quantum computing in power systems are rare. As the power industry is the foundation of the national economy, introducing quantum computing into the power system has far-reaching and crucial significance, such as improving the penetration of renewable energy, enhancing the computing efficiency, and helping in achieving the goal of net zero and climate neutrality by 2050. This paper first introduces the core concepts, essential ideas and theories of quantum computing, and then reviews the existing literature on the applications of quantum computing in power systems, and puts forward our critical thinking about the applications of quantum computing in power systems. In brief, this paper is dedicated to a tutorial on quantum computing targeting power system professionals and a review of its applications in power systems. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) introduce quantum computing into the field of power engineering in a thoroughly detailed way and delineate the analysis methodologies of quantum circuits systematically without losing mathematical rigor; (2) based on Dirac’s notation, the related formulae are derived meticulously with sophisticated schematic diagrams; (3) elaborate and derive some critical quantum algorithms in depth, which play an important role in the applications of quantum computing in power systems; (4) critically summarize and comment on the existing literature on the applications of quantum computing in power systems; (5) the future applications and challenges of quantum computing in power systems are prospected and remarked.

AB  - There is a divide in energy access studies, between technologically-focused modeling papers in engineering and economics, and energy justice frameworks and principles grounded in social sciences. Quantitative computational models are necessary when analyzing energy, and more specifically electricity, systems, as they are technologically-complex systems that can diverge from intuitive patterns. To assure energy justice, these models must be reflective of, and informative to, a wide range of stakeholders, including households and communities alongside utilities, governments, and others. Yet, moving from a qualitative understanding of preferences to quantitative modeling is challenging. In this perspective piece, we pilot the use of the value-focused thinking framework to inform stakeholder engagement. The result is a strategic objective hierarchy that highlights the tradeoffs and the social, economic and technological factors that need to be measured in models. We apply the process in Ghana, using a survey, stakeholder workshops, and follow-up interviews to uncover key tradeoffs and stakeholder-derived objectives. We discuss three key areas that have been rarely, if ever, well-represented in energy models: (1) the relationship between the dynamics of electricity end-use and the technology and economic structure of the system; (2) explicit tradeoffs between electricity access, cost, and reliability as defined by stakeholders; and (3) the definition of new objectives, such as minimizing hazards related to theft. We conclude that this model of engagement provides an opportunity to tie together rigorous qualitative analysis and stakeholder engagement with crucial quantitative models of the electricity system.

AB  - We examined the influences of pre-solving pause time, algebraic knowledge, mathematics self-efficacy, and mathematics anxiety on middle-schoolers' strategy efficiency in an algebra learning game. We measured strategy efficiency using (a) the number of steps taken to complete a problem, (b) the proportion of problems completed on the initial attempt, and (c) the number of resets prior to completing the problems. Using the log data from the game, we found that longer pre-solving pause time was associated with more efficient strategies, as indicated by fewer solution steps, higher initial completion rate, and fewer resets. Higher algebraic knowledge was associated with higher initial completion rate and fewer resets. Mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety was not associated with any measures of strategy efficiency. The results suggest that pause time may be an indicator of student thinking before problem-solving, and provide insights into using data from online learning platforms to examine students' problem-solving processes.

AB  - The classical result by Dyer–Scott about fixed subgroups of finite order automorphisms of Fn being free factors of Fn is no longer true in Zm×Fn. Within this more general context, we prove a relaxed version in the spirit of Bestvina–Handel Theorem: the rank of fixed subgroups of finite order automorphisms is uniformly bounded in terms of m,n. We also study periodic points of endomorphisms of Zm×Fn, and give an algorithm to compute auto-fixed closures of finitely generated subgroups of Zm×Fn. On the way, we prove the analog of Day's Theorem for real elements in Zm×Fn, contributing a modest step into the project of doing so for any right angled Artin group (as McCool did with respect to Whitehead's Theorem in the free context).

As a preamble to the design of a persuasive system for learning, we collected data to identify the study behaviours of students and recent alumni. We then developed two models to measure which behaviours have the most significant impact on learning performance. Current students reported more foundational behaviours whereas alumni demonstrated more higher-order thinking traits.

AB  - Facebook and Instagram are currently the most popular Social Network Sites (SNS) for young adults. A large amount of research examined the relationship between these SNS and well-being, and possible intermediate constructs such as social comparison, self-esteem, and repetitive negative thinking (RNT). However, most of these studies have cross-sectional designs and use self-report indicators of SNS use. Therefore, their conclusions should be interpreted cautiously. Consequently, the goal of the current experience sampling study was to examine the temporal dynamics between objective indicators of SNS use, and self-reports of social comparison, RNT, and daily fluctuations in negative affect. More specifically, we assessed 98 participants 6 times per day during 14 days to examine reciprocal relationships between SNS use, negative affect, emotion regulation, and key psychological constructs. Results indicate that (1) both Facebook and Instagram use predicted reduced well-being, and (2) self-esteem and RNT appear to be important intermediate constructs in these relationships. Future longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to further support and extend the current research findings.

AB  - The natural number bias (NNB) in arithmetic operations refers to the application of natural number properties to reasoning about rational numbers. Previous studies found the NNB interferes with students’ problem-solving. However, few studies have examined it in the Chinese context or the underlying mechanism by which it can be overcome. Addressing these gaps, in Experiments 1a (n = 31) and 1b (n = 30), we found that Chinese students demonstrate the NNB despite linguistic differences between Chinese and western languages. Experiment 2 (n = 38) adopted a negative priming paradigm and found that inhibitory control was necessary to overcome the NNB. Experiment 3 (n = 34) employed the event-related potential technique; we observed increased P2 amplitude when students solved congruent problems, and increased N2 and decreased P3 amplitude when they solved incongruent problems. These results indicated that the NNB is rooted in intuitive thinking, and overcoming this bias relies on inhibition.

AB  - Goals play a central role in human cognition. However, computational theories of learning and decision-making often take goals as given. Here, we review key empirical findings showing that goals shape the representations of inputs, responses, and outcomes, such that setting a goal crucially influences the central aspects of any learning process: states, actions, and rewards. We thus argue that studying goal selection is essential to advance our understanding of learning. By following existing literature in framing goal selection within a hierarchy of decision-making problems, we synthesize important findings on the principles underlying goal value attribution and exploration strategies. Ultimately, we propose that a goal-centric perspective will help develop more complete accounts of learning in both biological and artificial agents.

The ‘PSE’ term suffers from a branding issue to the point that PSE does not get the recognition it deserves. This work aims to provide an informative industrial and academic perspective on PSE, arguing that the ‘systems thinking’ and ‘systems problem solving’ have to be prioritized ahead of just applications of computational problem solving methods.

AB  - Motion estimation is considered significant for tracking the movement of an object in video sequences, and it is widely used in various video processing applications. Traditionally, many researchers focus on pixel-based motion estimation for object tracking, but it experienced increased computation time and cost. To reduce computation time, the utilization of a block-based motion estimation approach for object tracking is a recent trend. The existing block-based approach faces difficulty in finding representative points within the intensity domain. Therefore, this current research merged the deep learning approach with a block-matching algorithm for achieving efficient object tracking. In this proposed work, initially, video sequences are collected from a benchmark video dataset. Then, the acquired video sequences are segmented into frames. From the segmented frames, current and previous frames are considered for motion estimation. Frames are sent for the data augmentation process in which the process of flipping, cropping, and rotation is carried out. Then, the augmented frames are sent into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction. Representative Point Matching (RPM) is used to estimate the motion vector based on the extracted features. After estimating the motion vector, the similarity between two consecutive frames is found using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) technique. Finally, based on the similarity score, the movement of an object in the video is tracked effectively. Simulation analysis of the proposed block-based motion estimation model is done by evaluating some performance metrics. RMSE, PSNR, Execution Time, SSIM, and accuracy obtained for the proposed model are 27.5, 26.5 db, 31 sec, 0.91, and 94 %. This analysis suggested that the proposed CNN-RPM motion estimation model performs better in tracking the movement of the object.

AB  - Psychological treatments for persecutory delusions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis, are efficacious; however, mechanistic theories explaining why they work rarely bridge to the level of cognitive neuroscience. Predictive coding, a general brain processing theory rooted in cognitive and computational neuroscience, has increasing experimental support for explaining symptoms of psychosis, including the formation and maintenance of delusions. Here, we describe recent advances in cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis–based psychotherapy for persecutory delusions, which targets specific psychological processes at the computational level of information processing. We outline how Bayesian learning models employed in predictive coding are superior to simple associative learning models for understanding the impact of cognitive behavioral interventions at the algorithmic level. We review hierarchical predictive coding as an account of belief updating rooted in prediction error signaling. We examine how this process is abnormal in psychotic disorders, garnering noisy sensory data that is made sense of through the development of overly strong delusional priors. We argue that effective cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis systematically targets the way sensory data are selected, experienced, and interpreted, thus allowing for the strengthening of alternative beliefs. Finally, future directions based on these arguments are discussed.

AB  - With the increasing concern for climate change, renewable and sustainable energy production has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community, industrial practitioners, and policy and decision-makers. There are many technological alternatives for each sub-category of complex sustainable energy systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an effective tool to compare the environmental impacts of each pathway and identify the most promising alternatives from an environmental impact perspective. This contribution first reviews the environmental assessment methods and tools developed over the years. Secondly, a comprehensive review of the contribution of the PSE community to the environmental impact analysis of renewable energy systems is performed. It is observed that while LCA is the preferred method, these studies differed widely concerning the choice of impact assessment method used, the level of details shared concerning the underlying LCA calculations, and whether or not sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out, among many others. This makes the comparison of results from different studies difficult and often impossible. It is clear that the PSE community, with its emphasis on systems thinking and holistic approaches, plays a critical role in the design, integration, and operation of complex sustainable energy systems. However, the thorough calculations necessary to ensure a robust and transparent LCA analysis require a shared methodology and a detailed description of the rules. Such explicit, systematic, and transparent methods will set the bar for a minimum requirement for thorough LCA calculations, ensuring fair comparison and discussions of different technical solutions developed in the wider PSE community for sustainable renewables.

This study determines how ChatGPT can become a human agent for students on two financial accounting course units, multiple choice question assessments. The study provided five numerical-based and five narrative-based multiple choice questions. There were ten questions for the Introductory Financial Accounting and 10 for the Advanced Financial Accounting course units. ChatGPT received one question at a time requesting a solution. In the Introductory Financial Accounting section, ChatGPT produced incorrect answers because it incorrectly assumed the underlying assumptions contained in those questions. In Advanced Financial Accounting, ChatGPT presented incorrect answers because of the complexity of the task contained in those questions. ChatGPT demonstrated similar competencies in providing solutions to numerical-based and narrative-based questions. ChatGPT obtained the correct answers to sit in the 80th percentile in the Introductory Financial Accounting course unit assessment and the 50th percentile in the Advanced Financial course unit assessment. ChatGPT4 showed improved performance, with the 90th percentile for Introductory Financial Accounting and the 70th percentile for Advanced Financial Accounting. The findings indicate that the knowledge construct requires reflective thinking with ChatGPT in the ecosystem, and what is assumed and assessable knowledge must be revisited.

AB  - Due to the inherent shortcomings of traditional depth models, the Transformer model based on the self-attention mechanism has become popular in the field of fault diagnosis. The current Transformer's self-attentive mechanism provides an alternative way of thinking, which can make direct association between each signal. However, it can only focus on the association information within a sequence, and it is difficult to understand the information gap between samples. Therefore, this paper proposes the two-branch Twins attention, which for the first time uses cross-attention to focus on information associations between samples. Twins attention uses cross-attention to learn information associations between samples in addition to retaining the information associations within sequences learned by self-attention. The performance of the proposed model was validated on four popular bearing datasets.

AB  - Cognitive psychology seeks to understand how we acquire knowledge about ourselves and the world, how this knowledge is represented in the mind and brain, and how we use knowledge to guide behavior. Major topics in cognitive psychology include sensation and perception, attention, memory, categorization, learning, language and communication, and thinking, reasoning, judgment, and decision-making. Cognitive development is discussed from both an ontogenetic and phylogenetic point of view. Cognitive neuroscience explores the neural substrates of cognitive processes. The cognitive point of view has been extended to personality, social, and clinical psychology, as well as to sociology, anthropology, and other social-science disciplines.

AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies are progressing rapidly and may eventually be implemented widely within society, yet their risks have arguably not yet been comprehensively identified, nor understood. This study analysed an anticipated invasive BCI system lifecycle to identify the individual, organisational, and societal risks associated with BCIs, and controls that could be used to mitigate or eliminate these risks. A BCI system lifecycle work domain analysis model was developed and validated with 10 subject matter experts. The model was subsequently used to undertake a systems thinking-based risk assessment approach to identify risks that could emerge when functions are either undertaken sub-optimally or not undertaken at all. Eighteen broad risk themes were identified that could negatively impact the BCI system lifecycle in a variety of unique ways, while a larger number of controls for these risks were also identified. The most concerning risks included inadequate regulation of BCI technologies and inadequate training of BCI stakeholders, such as users and clinicians. In addition to specifying a practical set of risk controls to inform BCI device design, manufacture, adoption, and utilisation, the results demonstrate the complexity involved in managing BCI risks and suggests that a system-wide coordinated response is required. Future research is required to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the identified risks and the practicality of implementing the risk controls.

AB  - Cognitive computing seeks to build applications which model and mimic human thinking. One approach toward achieving this goal is to develop brain-inspired computational models. A prime example of such a model is the class of deep convolutional networks which is currently used in pattern recognition, machine vision, and machine learning. We offer a brief review of the mammalian neocortex, the minicolumn, and the ventral pathway. We provide descriptions of abstract neural circuits that have been used to model these areas of the brain. This include Poisson spiking networks, liquid computing networks, spiking models of feature discovery in the ventral pathway, spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, and deep convolutional networks. In summary, this chapter explores abstractions of neural networks found within the mammalian neocortex that support cognition and the beginnings of cognitive computation.

AB  - This paper proposes a practical method for determining the optimal allocation of micro-Phasor Measurement Units (μPMUs) for distribution system state estimation (DSSE). The proposed method formulates the state estimation based on the nest structure of DistFlow, which is used for power flow calculation in distribution systems due to the redundancy of less than 1. The use of μPMUs can significantly improve the accuracy of estimates. However, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) need to consider optimization constraints before deciding on the optimal location of μPMUs. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes the use of DPPBSO (Discrete Predator-Prey Brain Storm Optimization) of Evolutionary Computation (EC) to optimize the location of μPMUs. PPBSO is an extension method that applies the Predator-Prey strategy to Brain Storm Optimization (BSO), and DPPSO is the discrete version of PPBSO used in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The Predator-Prey strategy is critical in improving the solution candidates by intensifying and diversifying solution searches in EC. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the IEEE 69-node distribution system.

AB  - Rainforests play an important role in the global ecosystem. However, significant regions of them are facing deforestation and degradation due to several reasons. Diverse government and private initiatives were created to monitor and alert for deforestation increases from remote sensing images, using different ways to deal with the notable amount of generated data. Citizen Science projects can also be used to reach the same goal. Citizen Science consists of scientific research involving nonprofessional volunteers for analyzing, collecting data, and using their computational resources to outcome advancements in science and to increase the public’s understanding of problems in specific knowledge areas such as astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. In this sense, this work presents a Citizen Science project called ForestEyes, which uses volunteer’s answers through the analysis and classification of remote sensing images to monitor deforestation regions in rainforests. To evaluate the quality of those answers, different campaigns/workflows were launched using remote sensing images from Brazilian Legal Amazon and their results were compared to an official groundtruth from the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project PRODES. In this work, the first two workflows that enclose the State of Rondônia in the years 2013 and 2016 received more than 35,000 answers from 383 volunteers in the 2,050 created tasks in only two and a half weeks after their launch. For the other four workflows, even enclosing the same area (Rondônia) and different setups (e.g., image segmentation method, image spatial resolution, and detection target), they received 51,035 volunteers’ answers gathered from 281 volunteers in 3,358 tasks. In the performed experiments, it was possible to observe that the volunteers achieved satisfactory overall accuracy, higher than 75%, in the classification of forestation and non-forestation areas using the ForestEyes project. Furthermore, considering an efficient segmentation and a better image spatial resolution, they achieved almost 66% accuracy in the classification of recent deforestation, which is a great challenge to overcome. Therefore, these results show that Citizen Science might be a powerful tool in monitoring deforestation regions in rainforests as well as in obtaining high-quality labeled data.

AB  - The world is changing and business schools are struggling to keep up. Theories of reflective practice developed by the likes of Schon (1983), Gibbs (1988), Driscoll (1994, 2007) and Kolb (1984, 2015) are outdated and unfit for current purposes. Problems include the chronology of events, the orientation of the observer, the impact of external inputs, and the fact that neither education nor the workplace follow a structured, linear path. In response to these challenges, we propose a new ‘solution’: John Boyd's OODA loop. We argue that OODA loops offer the chance to reshape reflective practice and work-based learning for a world in which individuals must cope with ‘an unfolding evolving reality that is uncertain, ever changing and unpredictable’ (Boyd, 1995, slide 1). By embracing the philosophy of John Boyd and his OODA loop theory, business schools can develop greater resilience and employability in graduates, preparing them to embrace change while also embedding the concept of life-long learning to make them better equipped to face the uncertainty that the modern world brings.

KW  - Climate storylines
KW  - Downward counterfactuals
KW  - European Union Solidarity Fund
AB  - Recent research introduced the concept of climate storylines as an alternative approach to estimate climate impact and better deal with uncertainties. A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) without conducting a participatory analysis. Tropical cyclones represent a serious threat for the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 % percent may be required.

This paper presents a dialogical framework to help the teacher fostering creativity among students of computer science in programming and interaction design. The framework presented here involves underlying dialogic processes from seven collaborative and creative dimensions that allow students to develop creativity. The use of the pedagogical framework makes it possible to teachers create significant interaction design and computer programming experiences to students, motivating them to activate mental processes underlying creativity. Students can simultaneously activate two or more ideas, images, or thoughts and have them interact, prompt thought experiments, change cognitive perspectives, raise new points of view, and risk category mistakes.

The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process.
Background
The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation.
Design
Discussion paper.
Methods
We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results.
Results
In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases.
Conclusions
Using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time-efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical-thinking and fact-checking.

AB  - Creativity is necessary to human survival, human prosperity, civilization and well-being. Visual creativity is an important part of creativity and is the ability to create products of novel and useful visual forms, playing important role in many fields such as art, painting and sculpture. There have been several neuroimaging studies exploring the neural basis of visual creativity. However, to date, little is known about the relationship between cortical structure and visual creativity as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Here, we investigated the association between cortical thickness and visual creativity in a large sample of 310 healthy adults. We used multiple regression to analyze the correlation between cortical thickness and visual creativity, adjusting for gender, age and general intelligence. The results showed that visual creativity was significantly negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the left insula. These observations have implications for understanding that a thinner prefrontal cortex (PFC) (e.g. IFG, MFG), SMA and insula correspond to higher visual creative performance, presumably due to their role in executive attention, cognitive control, motor planning and dynamic switching.

AB  - On the dark side of creativity, creative ideation is intentionally used to damage others. This first electroencephalogram (EEG) study on malevolent creativity investigated task-related power (TRP) changes in the alpha band while n = 89 participants (52 women, 37 men) generated original ideas for revenge in the psychometric Malevolent Creativity Test. TRP changes were assessed for different stages of the idea generation process and linked to performance indicators of malevolent creativity. This study revealed three crucial findings: 1) Malevolent creativity yielded topographically distinct alpha power increases similar to conventional creative ideation. 2) Time-related activity changes during malevolent creative ideation were reflected in early prefrontal and mid-stage temporal alpha power increases in individuals with higher malevolent creativity performance. This performance-related, time-sensitive pattern of TRP changes during malevolent creativity may reflect early conceptual expansion from prosocial to antisocial perspectives, and subsequent inhibition of dominant semantic associations in favor of novel revenge ideas. 3) The observed, right-lateralized alpha power increases over the entire ideation phase may denote an additional emotional load of creative ideation. Our study highlights the seminal role of EEG alpha oscillations as a biomarker for creativity, also when creative processes operate in a malevolent context.

AB  - Summary
Computational structural biology aims to accurately predict biomolecular complexes with AlphaFold 3 spearheading the field. However, challenges loom for structural analysis, especially when complex assemblies such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), which catalyzes the link reaction in cellular respiration, are studied. PDHc subcomplexes are challenging to predict, particularly interactions involving weaker, lower-affinity subcomplexes. Supervised modeling, i.e., integrative structural biology, will continue to play a role in fine-tuning this type of prediction (e.g., removing clashes, rebuilding loops/disordered regions, and redocking interfaces). 3D analysis of endogenous metabolic complexes continues to require, in addition to AI, precise and multi-faceted interrogation methods.

The paper will also investigate how context influences which features of a theorem are salient and consequently which proofs are explanatory. The paper will discuss several ways in which explanatory proofs can contribute to teaching and learning, including how shifts in context (and hence in a proof’s explanatory power) can be exploited in a classroom setting, leading students to dig more deeply into why some theorem holds. More generally, the paper will examine how “Why?” questions operate in mathematical thinking, teaching, and learning.

AB  - In this opinion paper, we make a journey across different accounts of creativity that emphasize either the mindful, conscious and cognitive expression of creativity, or its mindless, unconscious and sensorimotor expression. We try to go beyond dichotomy, putting creativity in motion and outlining its embodied and enactive features. Based on the assumption that no creative act is purely conscious or purely unconscious, our discussion on creativity relies on the distinction of three types of creativity that complementarily contribute to the creative process through shifts in the activation of their substrates in the brain: the deliberate, spontaneous and flow types of creativity. The latter is a hybrid and embodied type, in which movement and physical activity meet creativity. We then focus on the most fascinating contribution of unconscious processes and mind wandering to spontaneous and flow modes of creativity, exploring what happens when the individual apparently takes a break from a deliberate and effortful search for solutions and the creative process progresses through an incubation phase. This phase and the overall creative process can be facilitated by physical activity which, depending on its features and context, can disengage the cognitive control network and free the mind from filters that constrain cognitive processes or, conversely, can engage attentional control on sensorimotor and cognitive task components in a mindful way. Lastly, we focus on the unique features of the outer natural environment of physical activity and of the inner environment during mindful movements that can restore capacities and boost creativity.

AB  - Information, the measure of order in a complex system, is the opposite of entropy, the measure of chaos and disorder. We can distinguish several levels at which information is processed in the brain. The first one is the level of serial molecular genetic processes, similar in some aspects to digital computations (DC). At the same time, higher cognitive activity is probably based on parallel neural network computations (NNC). The advantage of neural networks is their intrinsic ability to learn, adapting their parameters to specific tasks and to external data. However, there seems to be a third level of information processing as well, which involves subjective consciousness and its units, so called qualia. They are difficult to study experimentally, and the very fact of their existence is hard to explain within the framework of modern physical theory. Here I propose a way to consider consciousness as the extension of basic physical laws – namely, total entropy dissipation leading to a system simplification. At the level of subjective consciousness, the brain seems to convert information embodied by neural activity to a more simple and compact form, internally observed as qualia. Whereas physical implementations of both DC and NNC are essentially approximate and probabilistic, qualia-associated computations (QAC) make the brain capable of recognizing general laws and relationships. While elaborating a behavioral program, the conscious brain does not act blindly or gropingly but according to the very meaning of such general laws, which gives it an advantage compared to any artificial intelligence system.

AB  - This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art techniques used to simulate hurricane winds in atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) for wind engineering testing. The wind tunnel simulation concept is presented along with its potential applications, advantages and challenges. ABL simulation at open-jet simulators is presented along with an application example followed by a discussion on the advantages and challenges of testing at these facilities. Some of the challenges and advantages of using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are presented with an application example. The paper show that the way the wind can be simulated is complex and matching one parameter at full-scale may lead to a mismatch of other parameters. For instance, while large-scale testing is expected to improve Reynolds number and hence approach the full-scale scenario, it is challenging to generate large-scale turbulence in an artificially created wind. New testing protocols for low-rise structures and small-size architectural features are presented as an answer to challenging questions associated with both wind tunnel and open-jet testing. Results show that it is the testing protocol that can be adapted to enhance the prediction of full-scale physics in nature. Thinking out of the box and accepting non-traditional ABL is necessary to compensate for Reynolds effects and to allow for convenient experimentation. New research directions with focus on wind, rain and waves as well as other types of non-synoptic winds are needed, in addition to a more focus on the flow physics in the lower part of the ABL, where the major part of the infrastructure exists.

AB  - Affective computing (AfC) is a continuously growing multidisciplinary field, spanning areas from artificial intelligence, throughout engineering, psychology, education, cognitive science, to sociology. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to the aim of addressing numerous issues, regarding different facets of AfC solutions. However, there is a lack of classification of the AfC systems. This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing and evaluating the state-of-the-art studies in a qualitative manner. In this line of thinking, we put forward a threefold classification that breaks down to desktop and mobile AfC systems, and AfC machines. Moreover, we identified four types of AfC systems, based on the features extracted. In our opinion, the results of this study can serve as a guide for future affect-related research and design, on the one hand, and provide a better understanding on the role of emotions and affect in human-computer interaction, on the other hand.

AB  - Although there is no direct connection, the incidence of Legionnaire’s disease has increased concurrently with increased usage of energy efficient domestic hot water (DHW) systems, which serve as ideal growth environments for Legionella pneumophila, the bacteria responsible for Legionnaire’s disease. The Duck Foot Heat Exchange Model (DFHXM) was developed to aid design of energy efficient thermal pasteurization systems with Legionella control specifically in mind. The model simulates a system design imitating the countercurrent heat exchange in the feet of ducks, an evolutionary adaption reducing environmental heat losses in cold climates. Such systems use a heat exchanger to preheat fluids prior to pasteurization and cool the same fluid after pasteurization. Thus, the design requires minimal addition of heat to achieve pasteurization temperatures and to cover environmental heat losses. This article describes the underlying principles and use of the freely available Microsoft Excel model, as well as compares results from the DFHXM to measurements of an experimental pilot system. Simulation outputs agreed well with experimental results for transient and steady-state temperatures, the largest discrepancy in steady-state temperatures being 4.6%. Lastly, we discuss the flexibility of the DFHXM to simulate a wide variety of designs with special emphasis on Legionella control and solar-thermal water disinfection.

AB  - Awareness of the potential psychological significance of false news increased during the coronavirus pandemic, however, its impact on psychopathology and individual differences remains unclear. Acknowledging this, the authors investigated the psychological and psychopathological profiles that characterize fake news consumption. A total of 1452 volunteers from the general population with no previous psychiatric history participated. They responded to clinical psychopathology assessment tests. Respondents solved a fake news screening test, which allowed them to be allocated to a quasi-experimental condition: group 1 (non-fake news consumers) or group 2 (fake news consumers). Mean comparison, Bayesian inference, and multiple regression analyses were applied. Participants with a schizotypal, paranoid, and histrionic personality were ineffective at detecting fake news. They were also more vulnerable to suffer its negative effects. Specifically, they displayed higher levels of anxiety and committed more cognitive biases based on suggestibility and the Barnum Effect. No significant effects on psychotic symptomatology or affective mood states were observed. Corresponding to these outcomes, two clinical and therapeutic recommendations related to the reduction of the Barnum Effect and the reinterpretation of digital media sensationalism were made. The impact of fake news and possible ways of prevention are discussed.

KW  - Robot manipulator configuration calibration
AB  - High precision and low complexity control algorithm plays an important role in the developing of the end-effector instrumentation of different robot manipulators. In order to reduce the kinetic energy and the high-speed drift phenomenon of the repetitive motion tracking task, the robot manipulator needs to calibrate its configuration. In this paper, we formulate the configuration calibration of the robot manipulator for the repetitive motion task as a future quadratic programming optimization problem constrained with equality constraints, which is also regarded as a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and modern control engineering. Zhang neural network, which is a canonical method, can be adopted to deal with the continuous form of the future optimization problem, named as temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints. In order to overcome the issue of temporally dependent inverse computing, a novel Zhang neural network model and its uncertain disturbance tolerant model, which are termed as filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model, respectively, are proposed by integrating the energy-type cost function and Zhang neural network design formula for solving the temporally dependent quadratic programming problem with equality constraints in this paper. Based on the Euler discrete formula and the models, the discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network and the discrete uncertain disturbance tolerant filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms are proposed for solving the future quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and the robot manipulator configuration calibration problem of repetitive motion. The convergence properties of the reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model and its corresponding uncertain disturbance tolerant model are obtained by Lyapunov stability theory of nonlinear system and its corresponding perturbed system, while the convergence property of the filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network model is analyzed by the limit thinking. For the repetitive motion task, three experiments for solving the configuration calibration problem of PUMA560, Kinova Jaco2, and Franka Emika Panda robot manipulators are performed to illustrate the effectiveness, robustness and superiority of our proposed discrete filtered reciprocal-kind Zhang neural network algorithms.

AB  - Summary
Autonomous vehicles will share roads with human-driven vehicles until the transition to fully autonomous transport systems is complete. The critical challenge of improving mutual understanding between both vehicle types cannot be addressed only by feeding extensive driving data into data-driven models but by enabling autonomous vehicles to understand and apply common driving behaviors analogous to human drivers. Therefore, we designed and conducted two electroencephalography experiments for comparing the cerebral activities of human linguistics and driving understanding. The results showed that driving activates hierarchical neural functions in the auditory cortex, which is analogous to abstraction in linguistic understanding. Subsequently, we proposed a neural-informed, semantics-driven framework to understand common human driving behavior in a brain-inspired manner. This study highlights the pathway of fusing neuroscience into complex human behavior understanding tasks and provides a computational neural model to understand human driving behaviors, which will enable autonomous vehicles to perceive and think like human drivers.

AB  - Star sensors are an important means of autonomous navigation and access to space information for satellites. They have been widely deployed in the aerospace field. To satisfy the requirements for high resolution, timeliness, and confidentiality of star images, we propose an edge computing algorithm based on the star sensor cloud. Multiple sensors cooperate with each other to form a sensor cloud, which in turn extends the performance of a single sensor. The research on the data obtained by the star sensor has very important research and application values. First, a star point extraction model is proposed based on the fuzzy set model by analyzing the star image composition, which can reduce the amount of data computation. Then, a mapping model between content and space is constructed to achieve low-rank image representation and efficient computation. Finally, the data collected by the wireless sensor is delivered to the edge server, and a different method is used to achieve privacy protection. Only a small amount of core data is stored in edge servers and local servers, and other data is transmitted to the cloud. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the cost of communication and storage, and has strong privacy.

AB  - Mindfulness foundation is an excellent method of the human spiritual development by the reasonable thinking and consideration, which was established by Lord Buddha a long time ago. There are four ways of thinking and consideration-(i) form (body), (ii) sensation, (iii) spiritual and (iv) Dhamma. In this paper, we propose the use of the form consideration for the spiritual development, in which the form can be considered thoroughly inside the body by the spiritual projection. By using the nonlinear microring resonator known as a Panda-ring resonator, the electromagnetic (EM) signals called polaritons can be generated by the coupling interaction between the intense EM fields and the ionic diploes within the almost closed system, where the dipoles can obtain from the coupling between the gold grating and the strong electromagnetic fields. In the manipulation, cells, tissues, and organs inside the human body can communicate with the spiritual (polaritonic) signals and investigation. The simulation results obtained have shown that the Lorentz factor of 0.99999959 is obtained. The successively filtering of the signal circulation within the body during the meditation can be formulated and the meditation behaviors modeled. The aura, the stopping, and the cold body states can be configured and explained.

AB  - In mechanical optimization design problems, there are often some non-continuous or non-differentiable objective functions. For these non-continuous and non-differentiable optimization objectives, it is often difficult for existing optimal design algorithms to find the desired optimal solutions. In this paper, we incorporate the idea of gradient descent into cellular automata and propose a Cellular Gradient (CG) method. First, we have given the basic rules and algorithmic framework of CG and designed three kinds of growth and extinction rules respectively. Then, the three evolutionary rules for cellular within a single cycle are analyzed separately for form and ordering. The best expressions for the cellular jealous neighbor rule and the solitary regeneration rule are given, and the most appropriate order in which the rules are run is selected. Finally, the solution results of the cellular gradient algorithm and other classical optimization design algorithms are compared with a multi-objective multi-parameter mechanical optimization design problem as an example. The computational results show that the cellular gradient algorithm has an advantage over other algorithms in solving global and dynamic mechanical optimal design problems. The novelty of CG is to provide a new way of thinking for solving optimization problems with global discontinuities.

Uniquely human cognitive faculties arise from flexible interplay between specific local neural modules, with hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization. Here, we discuss how these computational design principles provide a scaffold that enables some of the most advanced cognitive operations, such as semantic understanding of world structure, logical reasoning, and communication via language. We draw parallels to dual-processing theories of cognition by placing a focus on Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2. We propose integration of these ideas with the global workspace theory to explain dynamic relay of information products between both systems. Deepening the current understanding of how neurocognitive asymmetry makes humans special can ignite the next wave of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence.

AB  - This chapter discusses various aspects of biological perspectives on creativity. Some of the research on creativity as of late involves the brain and biological correlates of originality, novelty, and insight. Handedness is sometimes used as an indication of hemispheric dominance or hemisphericity, with right-handed people being compared with left-handed people. There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have been studied with electroencephalogram (EEG), positron emission topography (PET), cerebral blood flow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem solving, or at least specific phases within the problem solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on divergent thinking tasks. The complexity disappears when those same individuals work on convergent thinking tasks. It is found that the role of the prefrontal cortex in creative thinking and behavior comes from several sources and uses different methodologies.

This paper applies a general search algorithm to a macroeconomic model with an observed interest rate and exchange rate to solve the signal extraction problem. Firstly, the algorithm is tested against a linear model with a known analytical solution. Then, the algorithm is applied to all the observed current endogenous variables in a non-linear rational expectations model of the UK. The informational advantage of applying the signal extraction algorithm is evaluated in terms of the forecasting efficiency of the model.

AB  - While research has shown that argument based systems (ABSs) can be used to improve aspects of individual thinking and learning, relatively few studies have shown that ABSs improve decision performance in real world tasks. In this article, we strive to improve the value-proposition of ABSs for decision makers by showing that individuals can, with minimal training, use a novel ABS called Pendo to improve their ability to predict housing market trends. Pendo helps to weight and aggregate evidence through a computational engine to support evidence-based reasoning, a well-documented deficiency in human decision-making. It also supports individuals in the creation of knowledge artifacts that can be used to solve similar problems in the same domain. An unexpected finding and one of the major contributions of this work is that individual unaided decision-making performance was not predictive of an individual's performance with Pendo, even though the average performance of assisted individuals was higher. We infer that the skills activated when using the tool are substantially different than those enacted to solve the same problem without that tool. We discuss the implications this result has for the design and application of ABSs to decision-making, and possibly other decision support technologies.

We focus on a lesson from our classroom teaching experiment in which the students were working on a problem that involved a linear functional relationship (y=2x). From the analysis of students’ written work and classroom video, we illustrate two different approaches that students adopt to express the relationship between two quantities. Students show fluency recontextualizing the problem posed, moving between extra-mathematical and intra-mathematical contexts.

AB  - This paper focuses on the differences between interior design students' design processes as derived from an analysis of their sketching and design behavior. By implementing qualitative methodologies in the analysis of the sketches produced in the conceptual phase of the design process, the experiment allows identifying sketching characteristics and profiles. The motivation is to show that sketches can serve as a tool to differentiate between designers and recognize their personal approach and design strategies. The results point to three distinct sketching profiles that characterize designers' use of sketches as a tool for thinking and communicating ideas during their solution generation process. Awareness to differences between students' sketches and design behavior may support the development of pedagogical concepts, strategies and tools.

AB  - This study explores the complex relationship between traffic noise and school children's cognition, acknowledging existing empirical inconsistencies and aiming to contribute to a richer understanding of this pivotal issue. Schools adjacent to noisy roads were selected, and outdoor noise levels were measured employing a Kimo dB300 sound level meter, focusing on noise level indices LAeq, L10, and L90. Subsequent calculations were performed to determine the noise pollution level (Lnp), noise climate (NC), and traffic noise index (TNI), revealing a severe noise exposure when compared to standard guidelines. A perception questionnaire for various noise and acoustic factors influencing cognition was developed, and 1524 student responses were collected. Data analysis incorporated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) for dimension reduction, revealing three latent factors labelled 'annoyance,' 'behaviour,' and 'cognition'. Further, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to explore multivariate relationships between variables and latent factors. Resultant path coefficients were obtained as 0.12, 0.98, and 0.10 for the impact of 'behaviour' and 'annoyance' on 'cognition' and the correlation between 'annoyance' and 'behaviour', respectively. Findings underscore a potent positive impact of annoyance, stemming from acute ambient noise exposure, on the deterioration of children's cognition. While suggesting that ambient noise may be correlated with adverse health impacts due to its influence on cognition, this study emphasizes the pressing necessity for noise mitigation in roadside schools and stringent enforcement of noise pollution guidelines in academic zones.

AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are an effective way to introduce students to contemporary scientific research. Research experiences have been shown to promote critical thinking, improve understanding and proper use of the scientific method, and help students learn practical skills including writing and oral communication. We aimed to improve scientific training by engaging students enrolled in an upper division elective course in a human microbiome CURE. The “Fiber Force” course is aimed at studying the effect of a wholesome high-fiber diet (40 to 50 g/day for two weeks) on the students’ gut microbiomes. Enrolled students participated in a noninvasive diet intervention, designed health surveys, tested hypotheses on the effect of a diet intervention on the gut microbiome, and analyzed their own samples (as anonymized aggregates). The course involved learning laboratory techniques (e.g., DNA extraction, PCR, and 16S sequencing) and the incorporation of computational techniques to analyze microbiome data with QIIME2 and within the R software environment. In addition, the learning objectives focused on effective student performance in writing, data analysis, and oral communication. Enrolled students showed high performance grades on writing, data analysis and oral communication assignments. Pre- and post-course surveys indicate that the students found the experience favorable, increased their interest in science, and heightened awareness of their diet habits. Fiber Force constitutes a validated case of a research experience on microbiology with the capacity to improve research training and promote healthy dietary habits.

AB  - Climate Change is a global issue which touches the lives of all human beings, each of whom have their own unique outlooks and motivations. Hence, the high degree of complexity which emerges from the involvement of such a large number of people might be better understood through the lenses of their individual differences. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched keywords on Web of Science™ and Scopus®, and included peer-reviewed articles which quantitatively examined correlations between personality and climate attitudes. After screening, 74 papers were included in our review. From these articles, k = 100 samples were extracted and included in meta-analysis models. Our results show that Climate Change Denial is positively correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (r = 0.39) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = 0.42), and negatively with Openness (r = −0.14), Conscientiousness (r = −0.05), Agreeableness (r = −0.11), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = −0.38), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (r = −0.38). Concern for Climate Change correlates with Openness (r = 0.10), Neuroticism (r = 0.12), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = 0.34), and negatively with Social Dominance Orientation (r = -0.36) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = −0.22). Finally, Proactivity towards Climate Change correlates positively with Openness (r = 0.17), Extraversion (r = 0.09), Agreeableness (r = 0.05), Neuroticism (r = 0.10), Consideration of Future Consequences (r = 0.39), and negatively with Social Dominance Orientation (r = -0.25) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (r = -0.31). Moderation analysis shows geographical variations in the Social Dominance Orientation and Climate Denial relationship. We conclude that some personality traits – such as Openness – transversally affect climate change attitudes. Moreover, meta-analytic data suggest that the personality involvement in Climate Change may be dependent on the socio-political context of different countries. Future research, policies, and communication campaigns should take these peculiarities into account.

AB  - Three-way decision model is an effective way to deal with complex decision problems. However, since the three-way decision models now proposed are all based on a single decision criterion, the decision results typically reflect only one preference of decision-makers. Thus, these models may also not effectively deal with complex decision-making problems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new three-way decision model based on ensemble learning. Specifically, we first obtain different three-way decision results by employing different decision criteria. Then, we can acquire the core and candidate sets of the positive and negative regions through set operations. Next, we use the K-means algorithm to divide the candidate sets into three disjoint subsets based on similarities. After that, we adopt a hierarchical filtering method to select suitable objects from the candidate sets and add them to the core sets. Finally, we employ four three-way decision models with different decision criteria as examples to conduct experiments on eight datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model can obtain higher classification accuracy and lower deferment rate than other traditional three-way decision models under most experimental conditions.

AB  - In Malaysia and also elsewhere in the world the demands for graduates who have employability skills such as ability to think critically, solve problems and can communicate are highly sought in the workplace. In the early 2006, the development of such skills was recognized as integral goals of undergraduate education at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Since then rigorous efforts have been made to inculcate these skills amongst the undergraduates. In this paper, we will share some of our experiences in coping with the challenges of changing our teaching practices to accommodate this quest though focusing on communication. For mathematics learning to occur, we believed that students should participate actively in the knowledge construction and be able to take charge of their own learning. Taking these aspects into consideration, we had developed a framework of active learning and used it to guide our instruction in engineering mathematics at UTM. Here we will discuss the strategies that we had designed and employed in engaging students with the subject matter as well as to initiate and support student's thinking and communication in the language of mathematics. Some student's responses that gave indications of their struggle, progress and growth encountered in the research implementation will also be presented.

AB  - Graduate student teaching assistants (GTAs) usually teach introductory level courses at the undergraduate level. Since GTAs constitute the majority of future mathematics faculty, their image of effective teaching and preparedness to lead instructional improvements will impact future directions in undergraduate mathematics curriculum and instruction. In this paper, we argue for the need to support GTAs in improving their mathematical meanings of foundational ideas and their ability to support productive student thinking. By investigating GTAs’ meanings for average rate of change, a key content area in precalculus and calculus, we found evidence that even mathematically sophisticated GTAs possess impoverished meanings of this key idea. We argue for the need, and highlight one approach, for supporting GTAs to improve their understanding of foundational mathematical ideas and how these ideas are learned.

AB  - A large variety of models have been developed in the last two decades aiming at supply chain (SC) stress-testing and resilience. New digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allow to develop novel approaches and tools in this area for the transition from standalone models to intelligent decision-support systems (DSSs). However, the literature lacks concepts and guidelines for the design of such systems. In this paper, we offer a generalized decision-making framework for using digital twins in SC stress-testing and resilience analysis as well as delineate how digital twins can contribute to theory development in SC resilience and viability. We position our proposed approach as an intelligent digital twin (iDT) – a human–AI system which visualizes physical SCs in digital form, collects and processes data for modelling using analytics methods, mimics human decision-making rules, and creates new knowledge and decision-making algorithms through human–AI collaboration. We conclude that the iDT supports monitoring, disruption prediction (early signals), event-driven responses, learning, and proactive thinking, integrating proactive and reactive approaches to SC resilience. The iDT helps to make the unknown known and so contributes to the development of a proactive, adaptation-based view on SC resilience and viability. This research can be used to solve existing problems in the industry, and it develops new methods and infrastructures for solutions to future problems.

AB  - When thinking about possibility, one can consider both epistemic and deontic principles (i.e., physical possibility and permissibility). Cultural influences may lead individuals to weigh epistemic and deontic obligations differently; developing possibility conceptions are therefore positioned to be affected by cultural surroundings. Across two studies, 251 U.S. and Chinese 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds sampled from major metropolitan areas in Texas and the Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, and Guangdong Provinces judged the possibility of impossible, improbable, and ordinary events. Across cultures and ages, children judged ordinary events as possible and impossible events as impossible; cultural differences emerged in developing conceptions of improbable events. Whereas U.S. children became more likely to judge these events possible with age, Chinese children's judgments remained consistent with age: Chinese 4- to 8-year-olds judged these events to be possible ∼25% of the time. In Study 2, to test whether this difference was attributable to differential prioritization of epistemic versus deontic constraints, children also judged whether each event was an epistemic violation (i.e., required magic to happen) and a deontic violation (i.e., would result in someone getting in trouble). With age, epistemic judgments were increasingly predictive of possibility judgments for improbable events for U.S. children, and decreasingly so for Chinese children. Contrary to our predictions, deontic judgments were not predictive. We propose that cultural valuation of norms might shape children's developing intuitions about possibility. We discuss our findings in light of three accounts of possibility conceptions, suggesting ways to integrate cultural context into each.

AB  - Stereotyping is a ubiquitous feature of social cognition, yet surprisingly little is known about how group-related beliefs influence the acquisition of person knowledge. Accordingly, in combination with computational modeling (i.e., Reinforcement Learning Drift Diffusion Model analysis), here we used a probabilistic selection task to explore the extent to which gender stereotypes impact instrumental learning. Several theoretically interesting effects were observed. First, reflecting the impact of cultural socialization on person construal, an expectancy-based preference for stereotype-consistent (vs. stereotype-inconsistent) responses was observed. Second, underscoring the potency of unexpected information, learning rates were faster for counter-stereotypic compared to stereotypic individuals, both for negative and positive prediction errors. Collectively, these findings are consistent with predictive accounts of social perception and have implications for the conditions under which stereotyping can potentially be reduced.

We replicated and developed a coding scheme used in previous research in the US to categorise lecturers’ questions in a sample of 136 lectures given by 24 lecturers at a research-intensive UK university. We found that the coding scheme could be applied reliably, and that factual questions were predominant (as in previous research). We explore differences in the lecturers’ use of questions – both between our UK sample and the previous US work, and between individual lecturers in our sample. We note the presence of strings of related successive questions from the lecturer, which we term ‘question chains’. We explore the nature of these, examine their prevalence, and seek to account for them in terms of the lecturers’ possible intentions.

AB  - The appearance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is significant for the future progress of the Internet of Things (IoT). Since the system model with a continuous action space and high-dimensional state space, the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and the computational offloading problem is non-convex, and traditional algorithms for instance ant colony algorithm, genetic algorithm, Actor Critic (AC) algorithm, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm are difficult to cope with. Reasonably formulating the computational task offloading strategy and the trajectory control of the UAV is crucial for the high-efficiency completion of the task. In this paper, a computational offloading and trajectory control system model for UAV-assisted MEC is proposed. We seek to maximize the user ratio of coverage by jointly optimizing computing offload scheduling and UAV trajectories. We propose an improved DDPG algorithm to optimize the objective function and achieve the optimal solution. Meanwhile, our algorithm can achieve an improvement in the user rate of coverage while avoiding obstacles as compared with baseline algorithms, AC, and DDPG.

AB  - Activist short sellers (AShSs) and financial analysts are information intermediaries who analyze firm disclosures as well as produce and disseminate influential investment narratives. This study aims to better understand narrative challenges surrounding the legitimate expertise of financial analysts. Specifically, we examine how AShSs challenge sell-side financial analysts' narrative authority (i.e., the perception that they produce expert knowledge) in interpreting firms' performance and future prospects. We investigate how analysts respond (or do not respond) to this challenge. We use 442 AShS reports, 12 interviews with AShSs and analysts, and analysts' stock recommendations and target prices. In their criticisms of analysts (found in one-third of reports), AShSs frequently frame analysts as lacking market expertise and critical thinking – two core dimensions of analysts' narrative authority. Sixty-six percent of analysts, although explicitly criticized in AShS reports, do not engage in written responses in their equity research reports because they reportedly either adopt a renunciation attitude to the challenge or they engage in off-the-record discussions with certain market participants. However, 34% of analysts respond overtly by counter-framing AShSs as lacking market expertise and objectivity. After the dissemination of AShS reports, analysts, on average, do not revise their highly visible stock recommendations but they revise target prices downward. Theoretically, this study extends our understanding of the construction of narrative authority in capital markets as we examine a challenge to the expertise of influential information intermediaries.

AB  - The effect of background music (BGM) on cognitive task performance is a popular topic. However, the evidence is not converging: experimental studies show mixed results depending on the task, the type of music used and individual characteristics. Here, we explored how people use BGM while optimally performing various cognitive tasks in everyday life, such as reading, writing, memorizing, and critical thinking. Specifically, the frequency of BGM usage, preferred music types, beliefs about the scientific evidence on BGM, and individual characteristics, such as age, extraversion and musical background were investigated. Although the results confirmed highly diverse strategies among individuals regarding when, how often, why and what type of BGM is used, we found several general tendencies: people tend to use less BGM when engaged in more difficult tasks, they become less critical about the type of BGM when engaged in easier tasks, and there is a negative correlation between the frequency of BGM and age, indicating that younger generations tend to use more BGM than older adults. The current and previous evidence are discussed in light of existing theories. Altogether, this study identifies essential variables to consider in future research and further forwards a theory-driven perspective in the field.

“Soft theories,” i.e., “heuristic models based on reasoning by analogy” largely drove chemistry understanding for 150 years or more. But soft theories have their limitations and with the expansion of chemistry in the mid-20th century, more and more inexplicable (by soft theory) experimental results were being obtained. In the past 50 years, quantum chemistry, most often in the guise of applied theoretical chemistry including computational chemistry, has provided (a) the underlying “hard evidence” for many soft theories and (b) the explanations for chemical phenomena that were unavailable by soft theories. In this publication, we define “hard theories” as “theories derived from quantum chemistry.” Both soft and hard theories can be qualitative and quantitative, and the “Houk quadrant” is proposed as a helpful categorization tool. Furthermore, the language of soft theories is often used appropriately to describe quantum chemical results. A valid and useful way of doing science is the appropriate use and application of both soft and hard theories along with the best nomenclature available for successful communication of results and ideas.

AB  - When we are unaware of the causes for the observed deviations, we are more likely to react. When we react or are unaware of problems, we fail. Increasing the effectiveness of quality control samples starts with addressing what we do not know about them. So, this chapter first clarifies what we want, then describes what we have, and lastly what can be done to fill the gaps. The development, validation, and application of the batch control spike is a great illustration highlighting the importance the quality of the performance feedback and learning capacity the control samples are supposed to provide. When done correctly—while contextually questioning the relevance and appropriateness of current operating criteria, imposed limits and standards—the introduction of the batch control spike allows a process of critical errors identification, compensation, and progressive elimination to take place so that at the end, no significant systematic errors remain. This fact is demonstrated using z-scores from multiple international round-robin studies. In the context of achieving accuracy, the batch control spike examines the relationships between the standards used, when they are spiked, how they are spiked, and their purpose, that is, it renders the technology-in-use (isotope dilution) transparent and keeps it honest. It is also an excellent teaching tool. It is a quality learning sample helping the transformation of our methods into “thinking tools.”

AB  - Increased battery energy density is required to boost electric vehicle endurance; however, this also raises the possibility of thermal runaway and power battery explosion. Improving the cooling system performance requires optimization and enhancement of classical systems. Traditional design approaches struggle to simultaneously enhance multiple aspects of performance, while an optimization based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods is often inefficient. Therefore, by integrating a flow resistance network model (FRNM) with a weighted average optimization algorithm (INFO), an efficient optimization for the comprehensive performance of the system can be achieved. Five optimized systems under different airflow rates were obtained through optimization. A comparison with two existing systems validated the effectiveness of the optimized system. The results demonstrate that, compared to the two reference systems, the optimized system decreases the maximum temperature difference by 65.51 % and 39.07 %, respectively. Furthermore, the improvement in temperature uniformity is more significant, increasing by 63.76 % and 34.40 %, respectively.

AB  - There are two fundamental models to understanding the phenomenon of natural life. One is the computational model, which is based on the symbolic thinking paradigm. The other is the biological organism model. The common difficulty attributed to these paradigms is that their reductive tools allow the phenomenological aspects of experience to remain hidden behind yes/no responses (behavioral tests), or brain ‘pictures’ (neuroimaging). Hence, one of the problems regards how to overcome methodological difficulties towards a non-reductive investigation of conscious experience. It is our aim in this paper to show how cooperation between Eastern and Western traditions may shed light for a non-reductive study of mind and life. This study focuses on the first-person experience associated with cognitive and mental events. We studied phenomenal data as a crucial fact for the domain of living beings, which, we expect, can provide the ground for a subsequent third-person study. The intervention with Jhana meditation, and its qualitative assessment, provided us with experiential profiles based upon subjects' evaluations of their own conscious experiences. The overall results should move towards an integrated or global perspective on mind where neither experience nor external mechanisms have the final word.

AB  - The massive growth in mobile users and wireless technologies has resulted in increased data traffic and created demand for additional radio spectrum. This growing demand for radio spectrum has resulted in spectrum congestion and mandated the need for coexistence between radar and interfering communication emitters. To address the aforementioned issues, it is critical to review existing policies and evaluate new technologies that can utilize spectrum in an efficient and intelligent manner. Cognitive radio and cognitive radar are two promising technologies that exploit spectrum using dynamic spectrum access techniques. Additionally, introducing the bio-inspired concept ‘metacognition’ in a cognitive process has shown to increase the effectiveness and robustness of the cognitive radio and cognitive radar system. Metacognition is a high-order thinking agent that monitors and regulates the cognition process through a feedback and control process called the perception–action cycle. Extensive research has been done in the field of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio and spectral coexistence between radar and communication systems. This paper provides a detailed classification of spectrum sensing schemes and explains how dynamic spectrum access strategies share the spectrum between radar and communication systems. In addition to this, the fundamentals of cognitive radio, its architecture, spectrum management framework, and metacognition concept in radar are discussed. Furthermore, this paper presents various research issues, challenges, and future research directions associated with spectrum sensing in cognitive radar and dynamic spectrum access strategies in cognitive radar.
