AB  - Sustainable land use is crucial for achieving Carbon Neutrality goals, which requires a scientific identification of optimized pathways for land use patterns across multiple scales. Yet, current land use studies predominantly focus on single scales but lack system thinking and fail to establish complementary cross-regional carbon neutrality collaboration schemes. Applying life-cycle thinking to analyze land use sustainability and carbon neutrality potential at multiple scales could address this challenge. This study aims to present China's first multi-scale spatiotemporal optimization pathway for sustainable land use to improve carbon neutrality potential. It systematically integrates the complex spatial coupling relationships between land use intensity and efficiency. We integrate multi-scale sustainable land use pathways, spanning grid, basin, and administrative levels, and unveil significant variations in land use sustainability and carbon neutrality potential across China. Sixty-three percent of China's land is in low sustainability, and the overall carbon neutrality potential in China is relatively low, with regions accounting for <30 % facing more carbon neutrality missions. Implementing sequential and partitioned governance modes can effectively support China in achieving sustainable land use and advancing Carbon Neutrality goals. Our sustainable land use pathways for China provide valuable insights for systematically undertaking carbon neutrality actions across different scales.

AB  - Background
Food retailers in community settings are gatekeepers to the crucial food systems changes needed to improve population nutrition. Evidence-based models of change are needed to enable shifts in these complex retail environments. Systems thinking offers unique insights by capturing potential unintended consequences and multiple pathways to success. This study sought to create a systems map for retailers, public health practitioners and other stakeholders seeking to implement healthy food retail policies. It aimed to identify (i) points of intervention through which community-based organisations can shift to healthier food provision, and (ii) key feedback loops that could drive potential unintended consequences of such policies in a complex system.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews (n = 26) were conducted, from 2015 to 2018, across four community food retail settings where healthy food retail policies had been implemented in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were coded by identifying causal relationships and their direction between factors. Vensim software was used to merge interview results and then reduce the map to the strongest and most frequent factors and relationships. Illustrative implementation stories and points of intervention were identified.
Findings
The resulting map is titled the Systems Thinking Approach for Retail Transformation (START) map. Five prominent implementation stories incorporating 17 factors highlighted that: 1) retailer resistance to change is strongest in the beginning but decreases with the demonstration of favourable initiative outcomes; 2) successive changes tend to be increasingly complex, and therefore harder for retailers to implement; 3) organisational resourcing can be influenced through multiple pathways; 4) customer acceptability of healthy changes and retailers' willingness to engage in changes influence each other; and 5) challenges in accessing healthy supply options make retailers more resistant to implementing healthy changes.
Conclusions
The application of systems thinking to the challenge of unhealthy food retail creates novel and practical insights for retailers and health promotion practitioners into what actions are most likely to promote healthy changes in complex retail environments.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the importance of information systems in modeling interactive computations performed on (complex) granules and we propose a formal approach to interactive computations based on generalized information systems and rough sets which can be combined with other soft computing paradigms such as fuzzy sets or evolutionary computing, but also with machine learning and data mining techniques. Information systems are treated as dynamic granules used for representing the results of the interaction of attributes with the environment. Two kinds of attributes are distinguished, namely, the perception attributes, including sensory attributes, and the action attributes. Sensory attributes are the basic perception attributes, other perception attributes are constructed on the basis of the sensory ones. Actions are activated when their guards, being often complex and vague concepts, are satisfied to a satisfactory degree. The guards can be approximated on the basis of measurements performed by sensory attributes rather than defined exactly. Satisfiability degrees for guards are results of reasoning called the adaptive judgment. The approximations are induced using hierarchical modeling. We show that information systems can be used for modeling more advanced forms of interactions in hierarchical modeling. The role of hierarchical interactions is emphasized in the modeling of interactive computations. Some illustrative examples of interactions used in the ACT-R 6.0 system are reported. ACT-R 6.0 is based on a cognitive architecture and can be treated as an example of a highly interactive complex granule which can be involved in hierarchical interactions. For modeling of interactive computations, we propose much more general information systems than the studied dynamic information systems (see, e.g., Ciucci (2010) [8] and Pałasiński and Pancerz (2010) [32]). For example, the dynamic information systems are making it possible to consider incremental changes in information systems. However, they do not contain the perception and action attributes necessary for modeling interactive computations, in particular for modeling intrastep interactions.

KW  - Similarity
AB  - One of the main challenges of cognitive science is to explain the representation of conceptual knowledge and the mechanisms involved in evaluating the similarities between these representations. Theories that attempt to explain this phenomenon should account for the fact that conceptual knowledge is not static. In line with this thinking, many studies suggest that the representation of a concept changes depending on context. Traditionally, concepts have been studied as vectors within a geometric space, sometimes called Semantic-Vector Space Models (S-VSMs). However, S-VSMs have certain limitations in emulating human biases or context effects when the similarity of concepts is judged. Such limitations are related to the use of a classical geometric approach that represents a concept as a point in space. Recently, some theories have proposed the use of sequential projections of subspaces based on Quantum Probability Theory (Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Pothos et al., 2013). They argue that this theoretical approach may facilitate accounting for human similarity biases and context effects in a more natural way. More specifically, Pothos and Busemeyer (2011) proposed the Quantum Similarity Model (QSM) to determine expectation in conceptual spaces in a non-monotonic logic frame. To the best of our knowledge, previous data-driven studies have used the QSM subspaces in a unidimensional way. In this paper, we present a data-driven method to generate these conceptual subspaces in a multidimensional manner using a traditional S-VSM. We present an illustration of the method taking Tversky’s classical examples to explain the effects of Asymmetry, Triangular Inequality, and the Diagnosticity by means of sequential projections of those conceptual subspaces.

AB  - The conformational space of methacrylamide was explored by quantum mechanical modeling and surveyed in the 59.6–104.0 GHz frequency range using a millimeter-wave Stark-modulated free-jet absorption spectrometer. According to the relative orientation of the two unsaturated bonds, two conformers were observed, namely s-trans (A=5234.360(1), B=3364.9717(8) and C=2173.099(1) MHz) and s-cis (A=5207.292(1), B=3470.930(1) and C=2113.496(1) MHz). The s-trans conformation is the global minimum, with relative energy 4(2) kJ mol−1 and calculated isomerization barrier 15 kJ mol−1. Except for the methyl hydrogen atoms, s-cis-methacrylamide is planar and its methyl internal rotation barrier is 10.2(1) kJ mol−1. In s-trans-methacrylamide the allyl and amino frames form a dihedral angle of about 30° and the methyl internal rotation barrier is 7.4 kJ mol−1. This different behaviour is explained in terms of attractive and repulsive intramolecular interactions between groups: CH2/CO and CH3/NH2 for s-cis, CH2/NH2 and CH3/CO for s-trans. The tunneling splitting related to the double-well potential describing the interconversion between the two equivalent s-trans forms is 837.97(2) MHz and was reproduced by a one-dimensional flexible model using a 3.6 kJ mol−1 interconversion barrier.

AB  - Natural computing, inspired by biological course of action, is an interdisciplinary field that formalizes processes observed in living organisms to design computational methods for solving complex problems, or designing artificial systems with more natural behaviour. Based on the tasks abstracted from natural phenomena, such as brain modelling, self-organization, self-repetition, self evaluation, Darwinian survival, granulation and perception, nature serves as a source of inspiration for the development of computational tools or systems that are used for solving complex problems. Nature inspired main computing paradigms used for such development include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, rough sets, evolutionary algorithms, fractal geometry, DNA computing, artificial life and granular or perception-based computing. Information granulation in granular computing is an inherent characteristic of human thinking and reasoning process performed in everyday life. The present article provides an overview of the significance of natural computing with respect to the granulation-based information processing models, such as neural networks, fuzzy sets and rough sets, and their hybridization. We emphasize on the biological motivation, design principles, application areas, open research problems and challenging issues of these models.

AB  - Background
Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, and co-occurring mood symptoms. Network analysis offers a novel approach to investigate the intricate relationships between these symptom dimensions, potentially informing personalized treatment strategies.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2019 to October 2021, involving 1285 inpatients with schizophrenia in Liaoning Province, China. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-14), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Network analysis was conducted to investigate the network structure, central symptoms, and bridge symptoms.
Results
The network analysis uncovered profound interconnectivity between core symptoms and the anxiety-depression community. Central symptoms, such as psychic anxiety, poor rapport, delusions, and attention, were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Bridge symptoms, including insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety-somatic, conceptual disorganization, and stereotyped thinking, emerged as key nodes facilitating interactions between symptom communities. The stability and reliability of the networks were confirmed through bootstrapping procedures.
Discussion
The findings highlight the complex interplay between schizophrenia symptoms, emphasizing the importance of targeting affective symptoms and cognitive impairment in treatment. The identification of central and bridge symptoms suggests potential pathways for personalized interventions aimed at disrupting self-reinforcing symptom cycles. The study underscores the need for a transdiagnostic, personalized approach to schizophrenia treatment.

AB  - The distributive property plays a pivotal role in advancing students’ understanding of multiplication, enabling the decomposition of problems and the acquisition of new facts. However, this property of multiplication is difficult for students to understand. We used two unique data sets to explore middle school students’ use of the distributive property. Study 1 involved data from 1:1 structured interviews of students (N = 24) discussing worked examples and solving associated practice problems. We examined whether or not students used the distributive property to solve the problems and whether or not interviewers followed the recommended distributive property prompts or defaulted to more conventional methods. Despite exposure to worked examples using the distributive property and a protocol calling for attention to it, students and interviewers favored methods like PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) or long multiplication. Study 2 used a data set with middle school students’ (N = 131) item-level responses on Kirkland’s (2022; doctoral dissertation, University of Notre Dame) Brief Assessment of Mature Number Sense along with several related measures of domain-general and domain-specific skills. We extracted problems involving the distributive property for analysis. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that students’ use of the distributive property improved from sixth grade to eighth grade. However, both grade-level mathematics achievement and cognitive reflection uniquely predicted the correct use of the distributive property. Results suggest that middle school students who exhibit stronger reflective thinking tend to perform better on distributive property problems. Findings highlight cognitive reflection as a potentially important construct involved in the understanding and use of the distributive property.

A level-k speculator performs k rounds of iterative reasoning to infer information from asset prices. In contrast to the static rational expectations equilibrium, the level-k framework produces a unified theory of momentum and contrarian trading strategies. Besides, this paper discusses how the distribution of sophistication levels affects several market variables and it sheds new light on empirical patterns such as: (1) overreaction of asset prices, (2) the excess volatility puzzle, and (3) the excessive trading volume puzzle. Moreover, this paper explores whether the level-k strategy converges to the rational expectations equilibrium.

AB  - The relationship between stress-tolerance mechanisms (cell-wall structure, metabolism, morphology, etc.) of individual fungi and the physiochemistry of their food environment selects for a small group of specific spoilage organisms (SSOs). However, common process deviations and post-processing contamination widen the lens of potentially relevant spoilage fungi. For example, although heat-resistant molds are considered the SSOs in thermally processed foods, unintended events (deviations, post-processing contamination) lead to spoilage by other propagules, notably yeast. The frequency of these unintended events changes our assessments of which spoilage fungi are relevant to a given food system. Consequently, a framework using probabilistic and systems-based thinking is needed to understand spoilage risk. Toward that goal, simple molecular tools for identification and subtyping are required.

AB  - In this paper we report validation efforts around the finite-to-finite strand of a provisional learning progression (LP) for the concept of function. We regard an LP as an empirically-verified account of how student understandings form over time and in response to instruction. The finite-to-finite strand of the LP was informed by literature on students’ thinking and learning related to functions as well as the Algebra Project’s curricular approach, which is designed for students who are traditionally underserved by mathematics education. Developing and validating an LP is a multi-step, cyclic process. Here we report on one step in this process, an item and response analysis. Data sources include 680 students’ responses to 13 multipart computer-delivered tasks. Results suggest that revisions to the items, associated scoring rubrics, and in some instances the LP are warranted. We illustrate this task, rubric, and LP revision process through an item analysis for a selected task.

AB  - Objective
Predicting outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) may help improve patient outcomes. We developed and validated a machine learning prediction model for post-rehabilitation functional outcomes after ICH. Patient selection and explanatory variable settings were based on clinical significance. Functional outcomes were predicted using ternary classification.
Methods
The subjects were patients aged > 18 years without pre-onset severe disability who developed primary putaminal and/or thalamic hemorrhage and underwent an inpatient rehabilitation program. As explanatory variables, 43 values related to patient background, imaging-related findings, systemic conditions, neurological findings, and blood tests were acquired within 10 days of onset. As an objective variable, the functional outcome at discharge to home or nursing home was acquired using a ternary classification. The dataset consisting of the collected information was split into a training dataset and a test dataset with a ratio of 2:1. A predictive model using a balanced random forest algorithm was created using supervised learning from the training dataset. The predictive performance was validated using a test dataset.
Results
Between January 2018 and June 2019, 100 consecutive patients were included in the study. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for predictions of good, moderate, and poor outcomes were 0.952, 0.790, and 0.921, respectively.
Conclusions
The predictive performance of the model was comparable to that of previous models. Patient selection and variable settings from a clinical perspective may contribute to accurate and detailed predictions. These study designs are based on design thinking and may meet the needs of clinical practice.

AB  - We inquire into the role of Turing’s biological thought in the development of his concept of intelligent machinery. We trace the possible relations between his proto-connectionist notion of ‘organising’ machines in Turing (1948) on the one hand and his mathematical theory of morphogenesis in developmental biology (1952) on the other. These works were concerned with distinct fields of inquiry and followed distinct paradigms of biological theory, respectively postulating analogues of Darwinian selection in learning and mathematical laws of form in organic pattern formation. Still, these strands of Turing’s work are related, first, in terms of being amenable in principle to his (1936) computational method of modelling. Second, they are connected by Turing’s scattered speculations about the possible bearing of learning processes on the anatomy of the brain. We argue that these two theories form an unequal couple that, from different angles and in partial fashion, point towards cognition as a biological and embodied phenomenon while, for reasons inherent to Turing’s computational approach to modelling, not being capable of directly addressing it as such. We explore ways in which these two distinct-but-related theories could be more explicitly and systematically connected, using von Neumann’s contemporaneous and related work on Cellular Automata and more recent biomimetic approaches as a foil. We conclude that the nature of ‘initiative’ and the mode of material realisation are the key issues that decide on the possibility of intelligent machinery in Turing.

AB  - Software piracy represents a major damage to the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property. The rate of software piracy appears to be increasing globally, suggesting that additional research that uses new approaches is necessary to evaluate the problem. The study remedies previous econometric and methodological shortcomings by applying Bayesian, robust and evolutionary computation robust regression algorithms to formally test empirical literature on software piracy. To gain further insights into software piracy at the global level, the study also uses five neuro-computational intelligence methodologies: multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), radial basis function neural network (RBF), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and Kohonen’s self-organizing maps (SOM) to classify, predict and cluster software piracy rates among 102 nations. At the empirical level, this research shows that software piracy is significantly affected by the wealth of nation as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), the nation’s expenditure on research and development and the nation’s judicial efficiency. At the methodological level, this research shows that neuro-computational models outperform traditional statistical techniques such as regression analysis, discriminant analysis and cluster analysis in predicting, classifying and clustering software piracy rates due to their robustness and flexibility of modeling algorithms.

KW  - Endless fibre reinforced composites
AB  - The market for carbon fibers is forecast to experience a double-digit growth over the next years. The reason for this development can be found in the special characteristics of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) like high stiffness and strength at very low weight which make this composite an ideal material for lightweight design. However, the design of parts made of CFRP is a tightrope walk between costs, mechanical characteristics and manufacturability for product developers. On the one hand, the mechanical properties are highly dependent on the ideal fiber orientation within the part and the unique material characteristics can only be exploited with a suitable fiber orientation, but on the other hand, the ideal fiber orientation is often not manufacturable or the required manufacturing technique is too expensive. Therefore, a novel algorithm to support product developers in finding a manufacturable fiber orientation or patch layout which is as close as possible to the ideal fiber orientation is introduced. This algorithm computes and highlights areas with constant fiber orientation (=cluster) based upon the ideal fiber alignment from the CAIO method. With the help of the visualization of the clusters, product developers can be supported in the decision for the best patch placement and geometry as well as in choosing the best manufacturing technique. It is important to point out that the algorithm is intended for endless fiber reinforced parts only.

AB  - Discovering the processes and types of knowledge organization which are involved in the creative process is a challenge up to this date. Human creativity is usually measured by psychological tests, such as the Remote Associates Test (RAT). In this paper, an approach based on a specific type of knowledge organization and processes which enables automatic solving of RAT queries is implemented (comRAT) as a part of a more general cognitive theoretical framework for creative problem-solving (CreaCogs). This aims to study: (a) whether a convergence process can be used to solve such queries and (b) if frequency of appearance of the test items in language data may influence knowledge association or discovery in solving such problems. The comRAT uses a knowledge base of language data extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English. The results obtained are compared to results obtained in empirical tests with humans. In order to explain why some answers might be preferred over others, frequencies of appearance of the queries and solutions are analyzed. The difficulty encountered by humans when solving RAT queries is expressed in response times and percentage of participants solving the query, and a significant moderate correlation between human data on query difficulty and the data provided by this approach is obtained.

AB  - Makerspace environments are becoming popular project-based learning spaces where students interact with physical objects and peer collaboration, while developing 21st century skills and engaging with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. At the same time, augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. These results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments.

AB  - This text discusses today’s digital transformation through the lens of Horkheimer and Adornos’ study of the enlightenment. Policy and public discourse around digitalisation embrace and adhere to the narrow tenets enlightenment thinking; the idea that rationality, individual freedom, and a society free from superstition are necessary and attainable goals. The costs of what has come to be called ‘Modernity’ are many. Through the application of rationality to all spheres of life, married with disruptive technological advancement, humanity has diminished its’ imagination – its ability to seek new directions. To paraphrase Horkheimer and Adorno, Modernism fights against nature, of which we are a part, and thus, paradoxically, sets us in a fight against ourselves. Environmental degradation, the price of progress, being just one example of this – deadening work, consumerism and severed social connections being amongst others. In this framing, digitalisation itself comes to be understood itself as akin to a force of nature – one that we can do little about, other than adjust and adapt or be swept away. But this by no means a foregone conclusion, there is light at the end of the optical fibre. Albeit that recent technical developments around artificial intelligence appears to be pushing policy makers into hasty decisions, the pace of the technical development is not as fast as we believe, and in comparison with the Reformation – we have time. If we can restrain ourselves from the resist, adapt or die responses promoted in popular discourse in face of the shock of large language models and rising threat of automation, then we create room to consider economic, social, and ecological alignment and accord, in the decision making and design of future interactive artefacts and digital services. The article argues that through postdigital aesthetics, technology makers can embrace materiality and the inherent qualities of digital technology to formulate a critique of existing trajectories in digital transformation, with consequences for a more sustainable future.

AB  - Objective
We aim to investigate whether EEG dynamics differ in adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders), ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), compared with healthy subjects during the performance of an innovative cognitive task: Aristotle's valid and invalid syllogisms. We follow the Neuroanatomical differences type of criterion in assessing the results of our study in supporting or not the dual-process theory of Kahneman, 2011) (Systems I & II of thinking).
Method
We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes in 30 adults with ADHD, 30 with ASD and 24 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), the Aristotle's four types of syllogism mentioned above. The multiscale entropy (MSE), a nonlinear information-theoretic measure or tool was computed to extract features that quantify the complexity of the EEG.
Results
The dynamics of the curves of the grand average of MSE values of the ADHD and ASD participants was significantly in higher levels for the majority of time scales, than the healthy subjects over a number of brain regions (electrodes locations), during the performance of both valid and invalid types of syllogism. This result is seemingly not in accordance of the broadly accepted ‘theory’ of complexity loss in ‘pathological’ subjects, but actually this is not the case as explained in the text. ADHD subjects are engaged in System II of thinking, for both Valid and Invalid syllogism, ASD and Control in System I for valid and invalid syllogism, respectively. A surprising and ‘provocative’ result of this paper, as shown in the next sections, is that the Complexity-variability of ASD and ADHD subjects, when they face Aristotle's types of syllogisms, is higher than that of the control subjects. An explanation is suggested as described in the text. Also, in the case of invalid type of Aristotelian syllogisms, the linguistic and visuo-spatial systems are both engaged ONLY in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of ADHD subjects. In the case of valid type, both above systems are engaged in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of both ASD and ADHD subjects, while in the control subjects only the visuo-spatial type is engaged (Goel et al., 2000; Knauff, 2007).
Conclusion
Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, the differences in the EEG complexity between the three groups of participants lead to the conclusion that cortical information processing is changed in ASD and ADHD adults, therefore their level of cortical activation may be insufficient to meet the peculiar cognitive demand of Aristotle's reasoning.
Significance
The present paper suggest that MSE, is a powerful and efficient nonlinear measure in detecting neural dysfunctions in adults with ASD and ADHD characteristics, when they are called on to perform in a very demanding as well as innovative set of cognitive tasks, that can be considered as a new diagnostic ‘benchmark’ in helping detecting more effectively such type of disorders. A linear measure alone, as the typical PSD, is not capable in making such a distinction. The work contributes in shedding light on the neural mechanisms of syllogism/reasoning of Aristotelian type, as well as toward understanding how humans reason logically and why ‘pathological’ subjects deviate from the norms of formal logic.

AB  - The retina confers upon us the gift of vision, enabling us to perceive the world in a manner unparalleled by any other tissue. Experimental and clinical studies have provided great insight into the physiology and biochemistry of the retina; however, there are questions which cannot be answered using these methods alone. Mathematical and computational techniques can provide complementary insight into this inherently complex and nonlinear system. They allow us to characterise and predict the behaviour of the retina, as well as to test hypotheses which are experimentally intractable. In this review, we survey some of the key theoretical models of the retina in the healthy, developmental and diseased states. The main insights derived from each of these modelling studies are highlighted, as are model predictions which have yet to be tested, and data which need to be gathered to inform future modelling work. Possible directions for future research are also discussed. Whilst the present modelling studies have achieved great success in unravelling the workings of the retina, they have yet to achieve their full potential. For this to happen, greater involvement with the modelling community is required, and stronger collaborations forged between experimentalists, clinicians and theoreticians. It is hoped that, in addition to bringing the fruits of current modelling studies to the attention of the ophthalmological community, this review will encourage many such future collaborations.

AB  - Habitual behaviors significantly shape our daily actions. Furthermore, habit formation is proposed as a key mechanism contributing to the development and maintenance of addiction. However, the neural substrates underlying daily habitual tendencies and their contribution to behavioral addiction symptoms in everyday life remain poorly understood. To explore these questions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of data from 219 individuals who underwent neuroimaging (structural MRI) assessments alongside evaluations of their daily habitual tendencies and symptoms of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU). Using voxel-based morphometry, meta-analytic decoding, and mediation analysis, we found that daily habitual tendencies were positively correlated with larger gray matter volumes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), precuneus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Notably, the midline regions, including the vmPFC and precuneus, play a crucial role in value-based computation, emotional regulation, social cognition, and self-referential thinking. Individual variations in gray matter volumes within these regions served as mediators, influencing the bidirectional relationship between daily habitual tendencies and IGD symptoms. However, vmPFC variations were specifically found to mediate the pathway from PSU to daily habitual tendencies. Our findings suggest that the morphological architecture of the vmPFC and precuneus is associated with habitual tendencies in daily life and may mediate the development of addictive behaviors. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of daily habitual tendencies and their role in addictive behaviors.

AB  - The predominant, but largely untested, assumption in research on food choice is that people obey the classic commandments of rational behavior: they carefully look up every piece of relevant information, weight each piece according to subjective importance, and then combine them into a judgment or choice. In real world situations, however, the available time, motivation, and computational resources may simply not suffice to keep these commandments. Indeed, there is a large body of research suggesting that human choice is often better accommodated by heuristics—simple rules that enable decision making on the basis of a few, but important, pieces of information. We investigated the prevalence of such heuristics in a computerized experiment that engaged participants in a series of choices between two lunch dishes. Employing MouselabWeb, a process-tracing technique, we found that simple heuristics described an overwhelmingly large proportion of choices, whereas strategies traditionally deemed rational were barely apparent in our data. Replicating previous findings, we also observed that visual stimulus segments received a much larger proportion of attention than any nutritional values did. Our results suggest that, consistent with human behavior in other domains, people make their food choices on the basis of simple and informationally frugal heuristics.

I draw attention to a range of other systems approaches including system dynamics, soft systems methodology, complexity theory, critical systems thinking, critical realism and multimethodology. I conclude with tentative guidelines of my own.

AB  - The brain disease model (BMDA) and psychosocial models of addiction attend to phenomena at different levels of biological organization, and evidence suggests neither is sufficient to explain substance use disorder (SUD). Here, we extend a Bayesian model of the emergence and persistence of delusions to SUD etiology and recovery, building upon efforts to link lower-level impacts of psychoactive compounds to higher-level phenomena such as attitudes, beliefs, and self-control. According to the resulting two-component model of SUD, psychoactive substances interact with genetic and environmental factors to produce delusions about the biological importance of substance use and its contexts by perturbating basic human affective systems. These delusions are most often revised or rejected based on individuals’ existing belief systems. But in some individuals, factors explaining the persistence of an array of delusions (e.g., lower levels of executive functioning) prevent the evaluation and revision system from rejecting or revising beliefs that attribute high salience to substance-related stimuli. This theory provides novel hypotheses regarding the potential roles of factors such as dichotomous thinking, positive illusions and self-deception, and denial or lack of awareness in SUD etiology and recovery. Furthermore, it provides an account of SUD that may result in less stigma than the BDMA.

AB  - Ship engine room layout design (SERLD) significantly impacts a ship's transportation efficiency and safety by focusing on the layouts of equipment and piping. However, owing to complex constraints, previous research has mainly focused on single-dimensional layout designs and has failed to provide comprehensive references for designers. To address this research gap, this study proposes a collaborative layout method based on a multistrategy hybrid-objective artificial fish swarm algorithm (HMSAFSA). In terms of the underlying mathematical representation, a more stable Manhattan trajectory-based coding method suitable for a collaborative layout is proposed. Building on this coding method, multiple strategies are incorporated into the heuristic AFSA to enhance its optimization and collaborative performance. Collaborative evaluation functions and methods are designed and refined to ensure effective layout results for multiple objectives. Furthermore, a layout procedure incorporating bidirectional guidance strategies and hierarchical thinking is proposed. This method achieves collaborative layouts through the mutual guidance of optimal objectives. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through representative cases of various types of ship engine rooms in practical engineering. The method demonstrates its capability to offer multiple optimal layout schemes, thus presenting substantial value for practical engineering designs.

AB  - After a brief review of the evolution of thinking about systems, consisting of an ensemble of components, the chapter analyzes the nondeterminism, nonlinearity, and phase transitions in complex systems. A range of topics pertinent to complexity, such as self-organization, self-organized criticality, power law distributions, computational irreducibility, and quantitative characterization of complexity are then covered. Cybernetics and the interdisciplinary nature of complexity conclude the chapter.

AB  - The current view posits that objects, despite changes in appearance, are uniquely encoded by ‘expert’ cells. This view is untenable. First, even if cell ensemble responses are invariant and unique, we are consciously aware of all of the objects’ details. Second, in addition to detail preservation, data show that the current hypothesis fails to account for uniqueness and invariance. I present an alternative view whereby objects’ representation and recognition are based on parallel representation of space by primary visual cortex (V1) responses. Information necessary for invariance and other attributes is handled in series by other cortical areas through integration, interpolation, and hierarchical convergence. The parallel and serial mechanisms combine to enable our flexible space perception. Only in this alternative view is conscious perception consistent with the underlying architecture.

AB  - In the first author's thesis [Marcial-Romero, J. R., “Semantics of a sequential language for exact real-number computation”, PhD thesis at the University of Birmingham, 2004)], a sequential language, LRT, for real number computation is investigated. The thesis includes a proof that all polynomials are programmable, but that work comes short of giving a complete characterization of the expressive power of the language even for first-order functions. The technical problem is that LRT is non-deterministic. So a natural characterization of its expressive power should be in terms of relations rather than functions. In [Brattka, V., Recursive characterization of computable real-valued functions and relations, Theoretical Computer Science 162 (1) (1996) 45–77], Brattka investigates a formalization of recursive relations in the style of Kleene's recursive functions on the natural numbers. This paper establishes the expressive power of LRTp, a variant of LRT, in terms of Brattka's recursive relations. Because Brattka already did the work of establishing the precise connection between his recursive relations and Type 2 Theory of Effectivity, we thus obtain a complete characterization of first-order definability in LRTp.

AB  - When programming with sublinear space constraints one often needs to use special implementation techniques even for simple tasks, such as function composition. In this paper, we study how such implementation techniques can be supported in a functional programming language. Our approach is based on modelling computation by interaction using the Int construction of Joyal, Street & Verity. We apply this construction to a term model of a first-order programming language and use the resulting structure to derive the functional programming language intml. Intml can be understood as a programming language simplification of Stratified Bounded Affine Logic. We formulate intml by means of a type system inspired by Baillot & Terui's Dual Light Affine Logic. We show that it captures the complexity classes flogspace and nflogspace. We illustrate its expressiveness by showing how typical graph algorithms, such a test for acyclicity in undirected graphs, can be represented.

AB  - Single port access surgery requires several specialized and one-time use devices to perform the surgery. By making the specialized devices suitable for multiple use may reduce surgical cost and increase the popularity of single port access surgery. However, this requires a new design thinking that emphasize on modular design and sterilization. We are exploiting simulation and computational intelligence methods to aid the design process that includes splitting an existing single use device design into modules and identifying the parts from the modules for manufacturing. Linking the design of the device with manufacturing can be achieved using feature graphs. This paper relates the development of a multiple use hand instrument for single port access surgery by re- using and enhancing the design of single-use devices with the proposed simulation-based methodology.

AB  - We address the need to develop efficient algorithms for numerical simulation of models, based in part or entirely on adaptive resonance theory. We introduce modifications that speed up the computation of the gated dipole field (GDF) in the Exact ART neural network. The speed increase of our solution amounts to at least an order of magnitude for fields with more than 100 gated dipoles. We adopt a ‘divide and rule’ approach towards the original GDF differential equations by grouping them into three categories, and modify each category in a separate way. We decouple the slow-dynamics part — the neurotransmitters from the rest of system, solve their equations analytically, and adapt the solution to the remaining fast-dynamics processes. Part of the node activations are integrated by an unsophisticated numerical procedure switched on and off according to rules. The remaining activations are calculated at equilibrium. We implement this logic in a Generalized Net (GN) — a tool for parallel processes simulation which enables a fresh look at developing efficient models. Our software implementation of generalized nets appears to add little computational overhead.

AB  - The foreign language effect, or thinking in a foreign language, reduces judgment bias under uncertainty. This study investigates how language use (native versus foreign) affects accounting judgment on uncertainty expressions. We conducted two separate experiments: between-subjects and within-subjects, both of which included tasks requiring interpretations and probability estimations based on accounting standard uncertainty expressions. The results demonstrated that foreign language use affected the interpretation of uncertainty expressions and reduced judgment bias in probability estimation, particularly in the context of asset recognition. These findings have important implications for accounting research and reporting.

AB  - This paper draws a parallel between creative cognition and a multi-armed bandit problem involving learning from experience in an uncertain environment. Special emphasis is put on the optimal sequencing of divergent and convergent behavior by showing that divergence must be inhibited at one point to converge toward creative behavior so that excessive divergence is counterproductive. We test this hypothesis with a behavioral experiment, using measures of individual divergence and convergence components of creative potential in high school students. Results confirmed that a mix of divergence and convergence predicted high performance in a bandit task but not in a purely random task or in a simple repetitive task. These predictions are maintained after controlling for sex, personality, incentives, and other factors. As hypothesized, creative cognition was necessary for high performance under the appropriate conditions. However, it was not necessary to get high grades in a traditional school system.
Educational relevance statement
Relating to the goal of educators and public policies in the 21st century to make children and adolescents more creative, and schools more receptive to creative thinking, this research focuses on the creative potential and behavior of high school students. It provides an evidence-based policy argument in support of the screening and development by the educational sector of the creative potential of students.

AB  - Modern science having embarked on the thorough and accurate interpretation of natural and physical phenomena has proven to provide successful models for the analysis of complex systems and harnessing of control over the various processes therein. Computational complexity, in this regard, comes to the foreground by providing applicable sets of ideas or integrative paradigms to recognize and understand the complex systems' intricate properties. Thus, while making the appropriate, adaptable and evolutive decisions in complex dynamic systems, it is essential to acknowledge different degrees of acceptance of the problems and construct the model it to account for its inherent constraints or limits. In this respect, while hypothesis-driven research has its inherent limitations regarding the investigation of multifactorial and heterogeneous diseases, a data-driven approach enables the examination of the way variables impact one another, which paves the way for the interpretation of dynamic and heterogeneous mechanisms of diseases. Fractional Calculus (FC), in this scope characterized by complexity, provides the applicable means and methods to solve integral, differential and integro-differential equations so FC enables the generalization of integration and differentiation possible in a flexible and consistent manner owing to its capability of reflecting the systems' actual state properties, which exhibit unpredictable variations. The fractional integration and differentiation of fractional-order is capable of providing better characterization of nonstationary and locally self-similar attributes in contrast to constant-order fractional calculus. It becomes possible to model many complex systems by fractional-order derivatives based on fractional calculus so that related syntheses can be realized in a robust and effective way. To this end, our study aims at providing an intermediary facilitating function both for the physicians and individuals by establishing accurate and robust model based on the integration of fractional-order calculus and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes with the diseases which display highly complex properties. The integrative approach we have proposed in this study has a multistage quality the steps of which are stated as follows: first of all, the Caputo fractional-order derivative, one of the fractional-order derivatives, has been used with two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function on the stroke dataset and cancer cell dataset, manifesting biological and neurological attributes. In this way, new fractional models with varying degrees have been established. Mittag-Leffler function, with its distributions of extensive application domains, can address irregular and heterogeneous environments for the solution of dynamic problems; thus, Mittag-Leffler function has been opted for accordingly. Following this application, the new datasets (mlf_stroke dataset and mlf_cancer cell dataset) have been obtained by employing Caputo fractional-order derivative with the two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function (α,β). In addition, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the raw datasets; and cd_stroke dataset and cd_cancer cell dataset were obtained. Secondly, the performance of the new datasets as obtained from the Caputo fractional derivative with the two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function, the datasets obtained from the classical derivative application and the raw datasets have been compared by using feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, one of the algorithms of ANN (along with accuracy rate, sensitivity, precision, specificity, F1-score, multiclass classification (MCC), ROC curve). Based on the accuracy rate results obtained from the application with FFBP, the Caputo fractional-order derivative model that is most suitable for the diseases has been generated. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the applicability of the complex-systems-grounded paradigm scheme as proposed through this study, which has no existing counterpart. The integrative multi-stage method based on mathematical-informed framework with comparative differentiability prediction analyses can point toward a new direction in the various areas of applied sciences to address formidable challenges of critical decision making and management of chaotic processes in different complex dynamic systems.

AB  - We study the fundamental problem of distributed network formation among mobile agents of limited computational power that aim to achieve energy balance by wirelessly transmitting and receiving energy in a peer-to-peer manner. Specifically, we design simple distributed protocols consisting of a small number of states and interaction rules for the formation of arbitrary and k-ary tree networks. Furthermore, we evaluate (theoretically and also using computer simulations) a plethora of energy redistribution protocols that exploit different levels of knowledge in order to achieve desired energy distributions among the agents which require that every agent has exactly or at least twice the energy of the agents of higher depth, according to the structure of the network. Our study shows that without using any knowledge about the network structure, such energy distributions cannot be achieved in a timely manner, meaning that there might be high energy loss during the redistribution process. On the other hand, only a few extra bits of information seem to be enough to guarantee quick convergence to energy distributions that satisfy particular properties, yielding low energy loss.

Monat has hypothesized that human-level organismal self-awareness will emerge spontaneously in a well-connected neural network as the number of interconnected nodes exceeds ∼70 billion; he speculates that computer networks may achieve self-awareness as the number of nodes approaches this figure. Forests have historically not been perceived as interconnected networks of trees; recently however, researchers have described the “wood-wide web” in which underground fungi interconnect large numbers of trees and plants via chemical and electrical signals. Some of earth’s forests number many billions of trees, and some of the world’s prairies and seagrass meadows also contain billions of individual plants. These plant ecosystems may thus be self-aware, and in fact there may be a multitude of self-aware plant-based ecosystems on earth already. The speed of signal transmission via fungi within each ecosystem is much slower than that in humans, and therefore their organismal self-awareness may be of a different nature than the self-awareness that we associate with humans and upper primates. However, the possibility that our plant systems may be aware of the environmental insults that are being wrought upon them should make us reconsider our anthropocentric activities, as well as the possibility that humanity may need to collaborate with other intelligent non-human earth-based life forms to ensure mutual survival.

The container-loading research has important industrial and commercial application for global logistics. In practice, loading pooled shipment into containers is a complex procedure that has relied largely on the workers’ experience. We developed an efficient computational procedure involving three-dimensional cutting for determining near-optimal container-loading patterns to minimize the waste of container space. We used numerical examples from a motor company that imports key components from Japan, produces parts in Taiwan, and assembles cars in China to estimate its validity and discussed the effectiveness of the proposed solution. This study concludes with a discussion of future research.

In addition, Nature has inspired the development of a significant number of pharmaceutical agents. In contrast, computational approaches applied to drug discovery date back to only a few decades. Nonetheless, computational methods are evolving at an impressive speed and are making significant contributions to identifying and developing bioactive compounds of therapeutic relevance. Computational methods have a broad range of applications in natural product research including the organization and comprehensive analysis of molecular databases, systematic screening of natural products libraries, computer-aided optimization of lead compounds, and identification of biological activities for natural products of dietary origin.

AB  - Cognitive biases are systematic cognitive dispositions or inclinations in human thinking and reasoning that often do not comply with the tenets of logic, probability reasoning, and plausibility. These intuitive and subconscious tendencies are at the basis of human judgment, decision making, and the resulting behavior. Psychological frameworks consider biases as resulting from the use of (inappropriate) cognitive heuristics that people apply to deal with data-limitations, from information processing limitations, or from a lack of expertise. Neuro-evolutionary frameworks provide a more profound explanation of biases as originating from the inherent design characteristics of our brain as a neural network that was primarily developed to perform basic physical, perceptual and motor functions, and which also had to promote the survival of our hunter-gatherer ancestors.

AB  - Titanium flexible intramedullary nails have become far more prevalent for stabilization of pediatric femur fractures in recent years. While steel may be expected to have superior fracture stability due to its higher elastic modulus; titanium alloy has experimentally demonstrated improved biomechanical stability, as measured by gap closure and nail slippage. The purpose of this study was to verify these observations computationally, and thus, explain why titanium alloy may be better suited for surgical fixation of fractured femurs. A finite element model of a femur with complete mid-diaphyseal fracture and having two 3.5mm nails in a retrograde “C” pattern was created. Static analyses were run in which the nail material properties were titanium alloy or stainless steel, respectively. Gap closure for the stainless steel nails was 1.03mm; while the titanium alloy nails had 0.69mm of closure. Titanium alloy nails slipped slightly less at each loading increment than stainless steel nails. The titanium alloy nails distributed stress more evenly along the nail axis, resulting in lower peak magnitudes. These results agree with previously published clinical and biomechanical studies that reported increased gap closure and nail slippage with stainless steel nails. The increased deformation of the titanium alloy nail likely increases the contact area with the intramedullary canal wall, thus, increasing stability. Additionally, stainless steel nails had higher curve apex von Mises stresses, potentially inducing a stress-shielding effect which could hamper remodeling and consequently increase risk of re-fracture.

AB  - Research on resident participation in neighborhood regeneration provides valuable insights for urban policymakers in environmental governance. While previous studies have extensively examined various influencing factors, they often neglect the impact of behavioral inertia. To address this gap, this study conducts a behavioral experiment to quantitatively assess the presence and impact of behavioral inertia on residents' governance and financial participation behaviors. A total of 576 valid survey questionnaires were collected, and conditional logit model and ordered logit model were utilized for analysis. The study reveals that behavioral inertia is indeed observable in residents' governance participation and financial participation behaviors. Furthermore, the findings underscore distinct drivers of behavioral inertia for these two types of participation behaviors, with emotional reactions predominantly influencing governance participation, while short-term thinking largely shapes financial participation. Theoretically, this study uses the innovative concept of “behavioral inertia” to offer a new explanatory framework for aspects of behavior that cannot be solely explained by the attributes of regeneration plans. Furthermore, the behavioral experiments utilized in this study exemplify how the research framework of behavioral science can be applied to the study of urban governance in a broad context internationally. Practically, the research findings provide valuable insights for urban policymakers to tailor measures aimed at promoting resident participation and fostering sustainable urban development.

AB  - Although rating scales to assess formal thought disorder exist, there are no objective, high-reliability instruments that can quantify and track it. This proof-of-concept study shows that CoVec, a new automated tool, is able to differentiate between controls and patients with schizophrenia with derailment and tangentiality. According to ratings from the derailment and tangentiality items of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, we divided the sample into three groups: controls, patients without formal thought disorder, and patients with derailment/tangentiality. Their lists of animals produced during a one-minute semantic fluency task were processed using CoVec, a newly developed software that measures the semantic similarity of words based on vector semantic analysis. CoVec outputs were Mean Similarity, Coherence, Coherence-5, and Coherence-10. Patients with schizophrenia produced fewer words than controls. Patients with derailment had a significantly lower mean number of words and lower Coherence-5 than controls and patients without derailment. Patients with tangentiality had significantly lower Coherence-5 and Coherence-10 than controls and patients without tangentiality. Despite the small samples of patients with clinically apparent thought disorder, CoVec was able to detect subtle differences between controls and patients with either or both of the two forms of disorganization.

AB  - In the past, a range of computational models have been developed for analysing the social implications of spatial patterns and types. While such models are typically focussed on macro-patterns, often in cellular or linearly-organised spaces, few models exist for predicting where people will cluster within complex environments. One reason for this relates to the inherent uncertainty associated with spatial attributes and consequently of human spatial behaviours. The present paper draws on the concept of fuzzy spatial objects to develop an approach to handle such uncertainty in architecture. Focussing on large, open plan spaces, where the configuration of space does not define strict patterns of usage, the paper proposes a computational model for predicting patterns of spatial inhabitation. This new model relies on the theory of fuzzy sets to propose the existence of a “fuzzy architectural spatial object, (FASO)” which is comprised of spatial units with degrees of membership that reflect the possibility of a person being present in a sub-space or involved in a sub-function within a larger space. This model calculates and visualises the FASOs using a fuzzy inference engine and represents the space as distributed possibilities of presence according to the given data. After describing the model the paper demonstrates its application in the prediction of patterns of usage within a major exhibition space, and then presents a check of the efficacy of this prediction against the actual inhabitation of the space.

AB  - This paper proposes the concept of the probabilistic unbalanced linguistic term set which considers not only the probability of linguistic variables but also the non-uniform and non-symmetric distribution of linguistic labels. A new computational model on basis of Archimedean copula and corresponding co-copula is developed to deal with probabilistic unbalanced linguistic information. The most advantage of the model is that it can keep the closure of the operation. Some operational properties and particular cases are further investigated. We present the concepts of Archimedean copula weighted probabilistic unbalanced linguistic arithmetic average aggregation operator and Archimedean copula weighted probabilistic unbalanced linguistic geometric average aggregation operator, some properties are also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness and universality of the developed approach are illustrated by a hospital selection and comparison analysis. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to test the robustness of proposed methods.

Although sensitivity analysis is extensively addressed in the literature, little attention has been brought to the methodological aspects of the sensitivity of nonlinear parametric solutions computed through a continuation technique. This paper proposes four combinations of sensitivity analysis with continuation and homotopy methods, including sensitivity analysis along solution branches or at a particular point. Theoretical aspects are discussed in the higher order continuation framework Diamant. The sensitivity methods are applied to a thermal ignition problem and some free vibration problems. Remarkable eigenvalue maps are produced for the complex nonlinear eigenvalue problems.

KW  - Intuitionistic linguistic number
AB  - Conceptual design is a pivotal stage of new product development in manufacturing industries. Since multiple design alternatives are put forward at this stage, developing advanced evaluation methods is of great importance. Existing methods adopt additive models to integrate evaluation data. They face some inconsistency issues, e.g. inconsistency in the independent assumption and interdependent data, since evaluation criteria are interactional. Fuzzy measure that replaces the additivity with monotonicity has enabled advances in addressing such issues. This work proposes a two-additive fuzzy measure-based information integration approach to product design alternative evaluation for the first time. The evaluation data given by experts are in the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers. They are more in accordance with the thinking habits of experts because the hesitation degree in linguistic assessment can be revealed. In order to reduce the subjective bias, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method combining with grey relational analysis is applied to adjust evaluation data. Then monotonous two-additive fuzzy measure is identified by nonlinear programming using these data. It makes a good trade-off between computational complexity and presentation capability. Hence, evaluation data can be integrated by non-additive Choquet integral for ranking design alternatives. In comparison to additive model-based methods, the extra effect on the simultaneous satisfaction of criteria can be effectively revealed by the proposed approach. And the robustness of it is demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis. A case study on an elevator's design alternative evaluation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in K-12 education has flourished. In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.

AB  - This study proposes the Smart Design method to support the design decision making in the sustainable neighborhood development with multiple objectives. Instead of the “creative design” approach in the scenario making in traditional PSS and recent Geodesign frameworks, the Smart Design method applies the optimization algorithms to search for optimal design solutions in the design space. It integrates the design thinking, computational performance modeling and optimization techniques to efficiently and effectively approximate optimal designs. This method is applied to a hypothetical residential neighborhood design case study with three sustainability objectives: to maximize FAR, to minimize building energy use, and to minimize outdoor human discomfort. Based on the form parameterization, the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm is utilized to guide the evolution of the neighborhood design throughout 80 generations, with neighborhood performance modeling tools. The Smart Design method is able to identify 38 representative design solutions as Pareto optimal which are equally optimal. Those solutions set a basis for discussions and negotiations among stake holders to make design decisions with the three objectives. Further research will be focused on addressing the challenges such as recursive objective definitions, parametrization of complex forms, quantification of performances and optimization uncertainties, from simple cases to more realistic and complex designs for sustainable neighborhood development.

AB  - Improving flood resilience of communities requires a holistic understanding of risks and resilience options as well as the preferences and priorities of different stakeholders. Innovations in risk and resilience assessment have helped communities to identify gaps in their flood risk management strategy but selecting and implementing resilience solutions remains a big challenge for many decision-makers. In addition to traditional appraisals and cost-benefit assessments this also calls for a participatory process in which various stakeholders are encouraged to adopt a system-level approach in identifying interventions that can maximise a range of benefits and co-benefits. In this study, we investigate how a combination of modelling and measurement methods can help decision-makers with their flood resilience strategies. We apply a participatory system thinking approach combining Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) with a flood resilience measurement framework called Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC). We first investigate stakeholders' biases on flood resilience interventions, and then lead them through a system thinking exercise using FCM and FRMC to elicit mental models representing important aspects of flood resilience and their interrelation. These are then aggregated, representing the collective perceptions and knowledge of stakeholders, and used to identify the most beneficial resilience actions in terms of direct and indirect impacts on flood resilience. We apply this approach to the case of Lowestoft, a coastal town in England exposed to significant flood risk. Developed in close collaboration with the local authorities, the ambition is to support decision-making on flood resilience interventions. We find that this combination of methods enables system-level thinking and inclusive decision-making about flood resilience which can ultimately encourage transformative decisions on prioritization of actions and investments.

As evidence, we present a fine-grained analysis of a whole-class theory-building discussion with 8th grade students. The goal of the discussion was to construct a theoretical account for why a glass of cold milk warmed quickly at first and then more slowly as it approached room temperature. Though they initially produced scientifically non-normative explanations, by the end of the discussion the class had refined their ideas into an explanation of difference drives rate – a relationship at the heart of Newton’s law of heating and other equilibration phenomena. The students’ flawed initial explanations were productive in the knowledge-construction process, as the raw material they ultimately refined into a more scientific explanation. We argue that the theory-building discussion supported both creative and critical thinking and that this pedagogical approach has the power, more generally, to leverage failure productively for science learning.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) simulations and precise landscape visualizations are crucial for various applications, like landscape management and planning, computer and connection of the landscape, evaluation, and tracking of land use. The consequences of several plans and a large scene cannot be communicated using older methods of comprehensive environmental planning and development in a timely, rational, and coordinated manner. Architects have trouble incorporating ideas into other comprehensive planning implementation processes. Architects did not thoroughly investigate the neighbourhood's demographics and matching behavioural needs and lacked critical thinking. The 3D dynamic landscape simulation is a detailed computerized three-dimensional simulation of the environment that can be dynamically presented. With the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, the system possesses a strong sense of reality, a user-friendly interface, and interactive features that can be tailored to the requirements of the contemporary urban environmental landscape. Regarding exterior publicity, domestic assistance, environmental land use planning, and information systems. The novelty of the proposed Interactive Design System based on AI (IDS-AI) is to create a 3D dynamic landscape model based on a real-life environmental scene, utilizing a Geographic Information System (GIS) to optimize landscape vision. Secondly, 3D environmental landscape design simulation was implemented using GIS spatial analysis in conjunction with the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to reduce the data overlap rate and help make an accurate decision. Finally, the design incorporates the development of the interactive interface system application of landscape design and environmental resources for viewing the landscape, the factors that affect them, and the area coverage ratio of various land cover types. The experimental outcomes show that the suggested IDS model increases the gradient sensitivity level of 98.3 % and area coverage ratio of 93.4 % compared to other existing models.

It is based on existing models that have been successful in traditional decision tasks involving preferential choice. The model assumes shifting attention over time that determines momentary inputs to an evolving preference state. In this chapter, the cognitive model is extended to illustrate how links from the motor system may be incorporated. These links can basically be categorized into one of three influences: modifying the subjective evaluation of choice options, restricting attention, and altering the options that are to be found in the choice set. The implications for the formal model are introduced and preliminary evidence is drawn from the extant literature.

AB  - Human systems need to be adaptive to the consequences of natural hazards. Public policy decisions on natural hazard mitigation can benefit from computational models that embody a comprehensive view of the system. Such models need to be transparent and integrate both expert and lay expert knowledge and experience in an efficient manner. By integrating hard and soft sciences within an overall systems framework, scientists, policy makers and communities can better understand how to improve adaptive capacity. We present a fuzzy cognitive map based Auto-Associative Neural Networks framework generated from a development mixed method integration (triangulation) for adaptive policy formulations. The specific policies relate to preparation for, response to, and recovery from earthquakes in mountainous ski-field environments – a case study chosen to highlight the framework. Three different data collection techniques – expert geomorphic assessments, semi-structured qualitative interviews with three stakeholder groups (experts and lay experts), and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) (node and arc maps of stakeholder perceptions) were employed. FCM were first analysed using Graph theory indices to determine map structure. Special attention was paid to subsequent processing of fuzzy cognitive maps (e.g., condensation and aggregation) with qualitative followed by quantitative means to simplify the FCM from the original total of 300 variables to 5 high-level themes to improve the efficacy of subsequent policy simulations. Specifically, the use of Self Organising Maps (SOM) to group concepts (condensation) and individual stakeholders (aggregation) into social group FCMs is a novel contribution to advancing FCM. In the process, SOM also enabled the embedment of nonlinear relationships inherent in the system in the simplified FCM allowing a platform for realistic and meaningful policy simulations based on collective perceptions. Specifically, each of the three simplified stakeholder group FCM and a total social group FCM was represented by Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANN) which converts an FCM into a dynamical system that allows policy scenario simulations based on input from both expert and lay expert stakeholders. A policy scenario is the level of importance given to a set of concepts and their effects on the system behaviour as revealed by the simulations. We present the results from one of several policy simulations to highlight the effectiveness of the mixed-method integration leading to simplified-FCM based ANNN simulations. Results revealed the similarities and differences between stakeholder group responses in relation to the scenario analysed and how these formed collective responses in the total social group map. Furthermore, outcomes of group and total social group simulations could be interpreted from individual and group stakeholder FCMs giving credibility to the mixed-method approach.

AB  - Purpose
In this paper, the author has tried to outline the main ideas in connection with what the author conceives to be the university of the future, a university that should not only educate people within the university system but also prepare them to fill specific job positions at both local and global levels, apart from necessarily providing them with the critical thinking and competences in autonomous learning that will make them flexible and capable of adapting to the job market and to a fast-changing world in general.
Design/methodology/approach
The author has revised some of the major issues that are going to determine the direction of the university of the future, i.e. the employment opportunities of tomorrow; the role of new technologies, especially the impact of artificial intelligence (AI); quality in higher education; and internationalization.
Findings
The author has also pointed out the importance of the technologies and the great role they indisputably play in present and future education at all levels, a fact that has been particularly and hugely enhanced and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic situation, thereby facilitating and fostering distance learning. This is very much connected to the application of AI to higher education, another unavoidable issue of utmost importance for the university of the future. While these technological advances present a challenge to universities, which must determine which are necessary and desirable and how to implement them, it is, ultimately, our responsibility to use them, in an ethical way, to the benefit of our students. The university of the future also has to be of high quality, and this involves carrying out important and decisive action having to do with matters of inclusion, hiring policies and the expansion of international opportunities for all parties involved.
Originality/value
This paper outlines the main ideas in connection with what the author conceives to be the university of the future, a university that should not only educate people within the university system but also prepare them to fill specific job positions at both local and global levels, apart from necessarily providing them with the critical thinking and competences in autonomous learning that will make them flexible and capable of adapting to the job market and to a fast-changing world in general. Moreover, the role of new technologies (especially the impact of AI), quality and internationalization are also discussed as relevant factors in this view of the university of the future.

AB  - The state-of-the-art of membrane technology is characterized by a number of mature applications such as sterile filtration, hemodialysis, water purification and gas separation, as well as many more niche applications of successful membrane-based separation and processing of fluid mixtures. The membrane industry is currently employing a portfolio of established materials, mostly standard polymers or inorganic materials (not originally developed for membranes), and easily scalable manufacturing processes such as phase inversion, interfacial polymerization and coating. Innovations in membranes and their manufacturing processes must meet the desired intrinsic properties that determine selectivity and flux, for specific applications. However, tunable and stable performance, as well as sustainability over the entire life cycle of membrane products are becoming increasingly important. Membrane manufacturers are progressively required to share the carbon footprint of their membrane modules with their customers. Environmental awareness among the world's population is a growing phenomenon and finds its reflection in product development and manufacturing processes. In membrane technology one can see initial steps in this direction with the replacement of hazardous solvents, the utilization of renewable materials for membrane production and the reuse of membrane modules. Other examples include increasing the stability of organic membrane polymers and lowering the cost of inorganic membranes. In a long-term perspective, many more developments in materials science will be required for making new, advanced membranes. These include “tools” such as self-assembly or micro- and nano-fabrication, and “building blocks”, e.g. tailored block copolymers or 1D, 2D and 3D materials. Such membranes must be fabricated in a simpler manner and be more versatile than existing ones. In this perspective paper, a vision of such LEGO®-like membranes with precisely adjustable properties will be illustrated with, where possible, examples that already demonstrate feasibility. These include the possibility to switch properties using an external stimulus, adapting a membrane's selectivity to a given separation, or providing the ability to assemble, disassemble and reassemble the membrane on a suitable support as scaffold, in situ, in place and on-demand. Overall, it is foreseen that the scope of future membrane applications will become much wider, based on improved existing membrane materials and manufacturing processes, as well as the combination of novel, tailor-made “building blocks” and “tools” for the fabrication of next-generation membranes tuned to specific applications.

AB  - In this work we explored undergraduate students’ geometric and visual interpretations of the inscription for contour integrals, ∫Cfzdz, without them having any prior knowledge of integration of complex-valued functions. Our research participants drew from various sources of geometric and visual interpretations to productively investigate the components of contour integrals, which they conveyed with diagrams and gesture. Although this enabled significant progress, they were overwhelmed coordinating the multiple quantitative relationships and reverted to simplified interpretations such as summing values of z,fz, or ∆z. In other words, they were unable to maintain focus on what was accumulated. Our participants also engaged in the thinking real, doing complex phenomenon which sometimes provided productive feedback to assess their interpretations. We offer potential reasons for students’ struggles including various interpretations for integration of real-valued integration and the layering of inscriptions. We also provide potential instructional strategies based on the participants’ interpretations.

AB  - Industry 4.0 represents a turning point in the thinking of the production model since it is based on digitalized production systems with the aim of improving productivity, product quality, and delivery time to the customer. The digitalization and evolution of information technology allowed the emulation of production system virtual models, namely in the concept of Digital Twin (DT), with the ability to simulate different scenarios providing support for better decision making. This concept not only represents a virtual copy of the physical world that obtains information about the state of the value chain but also illustrates a system capable of changing the development of the production activity according to the fulfillment of the intended business goals. In literature, the concept of the Digital Twin is exhaustively treated as a stand-alone factory (one digital factory represents one physical factory) and underestimates the possibility of a DT oriented to a customized product (a project) that requires decentralized production systems. This paper brings to discussion the relevance of product customized applying DT to smart customization, and the inclusion of decentralized production systems supported by Cloud Manufacturing.

AB  - Dynamical games model interactions between agents that take place in ever-shifting environments. Due to the increasing penetration of autonomous systems to society, understanding and predicting the outcomes of these games has become crucial. In this work, we highlight the importance of nonequilibrium solutions to dynamical games through the lens of bounded rationality. We describe the principles of level-k thinking and cognitive hierarchy – concepts developed in the field of economics – via mathematical tools and formulation of control theory. We describe the main principles of bounded rationality for nonequilibrium differential games in both nonlinear non-zero-sum and linear zero-sum settings. The importance of those approaches is highlighted in problems of pursuit evasion between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, while the core of the bounded rationality principles that we employ are extended to discrete stochastic dynamical games. The versatility of the proposed approach is complemented by rigorous mathematical guarantees that enable predictability of the games’ outcomes.

AB  - Bone is probably the most frequently investigated biological material and finite element analysis (FEA) is the computational tool most commonly used for the analysis of bone biomechanical function. FEA has been used in bone research for more than 30 years and has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the complex behavior of bone. Bone is structured in a hierarchical way covering many length scales and this chapter reflects this hierarchical organization. In particular, the focus is on the applications of FEA for understanding the relationship between bone structure and its mechanical function at specific hierarchical levels. Depending on the hierarchical level, different issues have been investigated with FEA ranging from more clinically oriented topics related to bone quality (eg, predicting bone strength and fracture risk) to more fundamental problems dealing with the mechanical aspects of biological processes (eg, stress and strain around osteocyte lacunae) as well as with the micromechanical behavior of bone at its ultrastructure. A better understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical function is expected to be important for the current trends in (bio)materials design, where the structure of biological materials is considered as a possible source of inspiration, as well as for more successful approaches in the prevention and treatment of age- and disease-related fractures.

AB  - 3D game development can be an enticing way to attract K-12 students to computer science, but designing and programming 3D games is far from trivial. Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. Our formal user study shows that with Incremental 3D, the gradual approach to transition from 2D to 3D authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3D games including 3D models, animations, and programming.

AB  - Summary
Psychiatry has increasingly adopted explanations for psychopathology that are based on neurobiological reductionism. With the recognition of health disparities and the realisation that someone's postcode can be a better predictor of health outcomes than their genetic code, there are increasing efforts to ensure cultural and social–structural competence in psychiatric practice. Although neuroscientific and social–cultural approaches in psychiatry remain largely separate, they can be brought together in a multilevel explanatory framework to advance psychiatric theory, research, and practice. In this Personal View, we outline how a cultural–ecosocial systems approach to integrating neuroscience in psychiatry can promote social–contextual and systemic thinking for more clinically useful formulations and person-centred care.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Grounded Theory (with Interval Probability Theory) are able to model these philosophical concepts related to practice based knowledge. The AI techniques appropriate for modeling Polanyi’s and Heidegger’s ideas should be founded more on a connectionist rather than a cognitivist paradigm. Examples from engineering practice are used to demonstrate how the above techniques can capture, structure and make available such knowledge to practitioners.

The product development process is accompanied by Intellectual Property Management activities that address the protection of the project's intellectual assets. In this way, the proposed process represents an addition to theory and practice by smoothly integrating the three most influential product design philosophies of today, while, at the same time, introduces a direction for managing intellectual assets throughout the product lifecycle.

AB  - The unprecedented expansion of digital technologies has led to a rapid increase in the development and application of 3D digital environments for landscape and urban planning in the past two decades. Considering the significant challenges in guiding human societies towards sustainability, these technologies must not only assist decision-makers in adapting to changes but promote fast, transformative shifts in the relationship between human societies and nature. Based on a set of global exemplars, this Perspective Essay outlines six key factors that can enhance efficacy of 3D digital environments to guide knowledge-informed landscape and urban planning. We call for (1) explicitly representing dynamic interplay between the social, ecological, and technical systems, (2) exploring the integration of design with simulation models to address cross-scale dynamics, (3) developing features to foster imagination, (4) employing multisensory stimuli to encourage profound changes in environmentally and socially sustainable behavior, (5) tailoring the incorporation of active sensing by and with non-experts into 3D digital environments to better acknowledge indigenous and local knowledge systems, and finally, (6) carrying out a usability evaluation to facilitate participation and collaboration in an efficient co-creation process. We conclude by recommending the establishment of a collaborative knowledge platform that unites researchers, developers, and stakeholders for stimulating social-ecological-technological system thinking in the development of 3D digital environments and harnessing the technological advancements to accelerate and drive the needed transformative change within urban and landscape planning.

AB  - Analytical decision making strategies rely on weighing pros and cons of multiple options in an unbounded rationality manner. Contrary to these strategies, recognition primed decision (RPD) model which is a primary naturalistic decision making (NDM) approach assumes that experienced and professional decision makers when encounter problems in real operating conditions are able to use their previous experiences and trainings in order to diagnose the problem, recall the appropriate solution, evaluate it mentally, and implement it to handle the problem in a satisficing manner. In this paper, a computational form of RPD, now called C-RPD, is presented. Unified Modeling Language was used as a modeling language to represent the proposed C-RPD model in order to make the implementation easy and obvious. To execute the model, RoboCup Rescue agent simulation environment, which is one of the best and the most famous complex and multi-agent large-scale environments, was selected. The environment simulates the incidence of fire and earthquakes in urban areas where it is the duty of the police forces, firefighters and ambulance teams to control the crisis. Firefighters of SOS team are first modeled and implemented by utilizing C-RPD and then the system is trained using an expert’s experience. There are two evaluations. To find out the convergence of different versions developed during experience adding, some of the developed versions are chosen and evaluated on seven maps. Results show performance improvements. The SOS team ranked first in an official world championship and three official open tournaments.

AB  - Monte Carlo simulations were performed to analyze the degree to which two-, three- and four-step learning histories of losses and gains correlated with escalation and persistence in extended extinction (continuous loss) conditions. Simulated learning histories were randomly generated at varying lengths and compositions and warranted probabilities were determined using Bayesian Updating methods. Bayesian Updating predicted instances where particular learning sequences were more likely to engender escalation and persistence under extinction conditions. All simulations revealed greater rates of escalation and persistence in the presence of heterogeneous (e.g., both Wins and Losses) lag sequences, with substantially increased rates of escalation when lags comprised predominantly of losses were followed by wins. These methods were then applied to human investment choices in earlier experiments. The Bayesian Updating models corresponded with data obtained from these experiments. These findings suggest that Bayesian Updating can be utilized as a model for understanding how and when individual commitment may escalate and persist despite continued failures.

AB  - The extent to which a person engages in reflective thinking while problem-solving is often measured using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005). Some past research has attributed poorer performance on the CRT to impulsiveness, which is consistent with the close conceptual relation between Type I processing and dispositional impulsiveness (and the putative relation between a tendency to engage in Type I processing and poor performance on the CRT). However, existing research has been mixed on whether such a relation exists. To address this ambiguity, we report two large sample size studies examining the relation between impulsiveness and CRT performance. Unlike previous studies, we use a number of different measures of impulsiveness, as well as measures of cognitive ability and analytic thinking style. Overall, impulsiveness is clearly related to CRT performance at the bivariate level. However, once cognitive ability and analytic thinking style are controlled, these relations become small and, in some cases, non-significant. Thus, dispositional impulsiveness, in and of itself, is not a strong predictor of CRT performance.

AB  - Background
Nurses are essential for assessing and managing acute pain in hospitalized patients, especially those who are unable to self-report pain. Given their role and subject matter expertise (SME), nurses are also essential for the design and development of a supervised machine learning (ML) model for pain detection and clinical decision support software (CDSS) in a pain recognition automated monitoring system (PRAMS). Our first step for developing PRAMS with nurses was to create SME-friendly data labeling software.
Purpose
To develop an intuitive and efficient data labeling software solution, Human-to-Artificial Intelligence (H2AI).
Method
The Human-centered Design for Embedded Machine Learning Solutions (HCDe-MLS) model was used to engage nurses. In this paper, HCDe-MLS will be explained using H2AI and PRAMS as illustrative cases.
Findings
Using HCDe-MLS, H2AI was developed and facilitated labeling of 139 videos (mean = 29.83 min) with 3189 images labeled (mean = 75 s) by 6 nurses. OpenCV was used for video-to-image pre-processing; and MobileFaceNet was used for default landmark placement on images. H2AI randomly assigned videos to nurses for data labeling, tracked labelers’ inter-rater reliability, and stored labeled data to train ML models.
Conclusions
Nurses’ engagement in CDSS development was critical for ensuring the end-product addressed nurses’ priorities, reflected nurses’ cognitive and decision-making processes, and garnered nurses’ trust for technology adoption.

The leashing process removes small fragments of code, pervasive throughout the application, and places them on a secure server. The secure server provides the missing functionality, but never the missing code. Reverse engineering the missing code, even with full tracing of the program's execution and its communication with the server, is computationally hard. Moreover, the server provides the missing functionality asynchronously: the application's performance is independent (within reason) of the secure server's speed. For example, the server might reside on a slow inexpensive chip or a remote Internet server. Leashing makes only modest demands on communication bandwidth, space, and computation.

AB  - A number of cognitive, causal mapping and simulation techniques exist for dealing with the growing importance of environmental uncertainty. After briefly commenting on some of the more salient extant approaches, this paper offers a new one for consideration by the scenario planning community. Comprehensive Situation Mapping (CSM) is a powerful analytical tool combined with a process for framing and debating strategic situations. The CSM approach combines the problem framing features of causal mapping with a dialectical inquiry process patterned after Churchman's. Like the better approaches to planning through cognitive mapping, it facilitates the “backward analysis” of the underlying strategic assumptions. Its novelty is that it also allows the “forward analysis” of a situation by computing the potential change scenarios. Initially developed for manual application, the principles of CSM were originally tested in appropriate case studies. The contribution of the present paper is to present its theory and point out that its future potential is even greater: in concluding we indicate that, by using recent distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) technology, a fully computerized and interactive prototype is now being set up for commercial applications.

AB  - Abstract:
Today biology is overwhelmed with ‘big data’, amassed from genomic projects carried out in various laboratories around the world using efficient high throughput technologies. Biologists are co-opting mathematical and computational techniques developed to address these data and derive meaningful interpretations. These developments have led to new disciplines: systems and synthetic biology. To explore these two evolving branches of biology one needs to be familiar with technologies such as genomics, bioinformatics and proteomics, mathematical and computational modeling techniques that help predict the dynamic behavior of the biological system, ruling out the trial-and-error methods of traditional genetic engineering. Systems and synthetic biology have developed hand-in-hand towards building artificial biological devices using engineered biological units as basic building blocks. Systems biology is an integrated approach for studying the dynamic and complex behaviors of biological components, which may be difficult to interpret and predict from properties of individual constituents making up the biological systems. While, synthetic biology aims to engineer biologically inspired devices, such as cellular regulatory circuits that do not exist in nature but are designed using well characterized genes, proteins and other biological components in appropriate combinations to perform a desired function. This is analogous to an electronic circuit board design that is fabricated using well characterized electrical components such as resistors, capacitors and so on. The in silico abstractions and predictions should be tightly linked to experimentation to be proved in vitro and in vivo systems for their successful applications in biotechnology. This chapter focuses on mathematical approaches and computational tools available to engineer biological regulatory circuits and how they can be implemented as next generation therapeutics in infectious disease.

AB  - This study aims to decode guest satisfaction with peer-to-peer accommodations by analyzing the relationship between guests’ sentiment and online ratings and examining how analytical thinking and authenticity influence this relationship. Based on reviews of 4602 Airbnb listings in San Francisco, we empirically find that positive (negative) sentiment is linked to a high (low) rating. We further show that this link is stronger when guests manifest a higher extent of analytical thinking and authenticity. Both Tobit and ordered logit models yield consistent estimation results, showing the robustness of our findings. Our study contributes to the tourism and hospitality literature by theoretically explaining the association between sentiment and ratings. In addition, this paper enriches our knowledge regarding the trustworthiness of Airbnb ratings.

AB  - This paper investigates how children who are engaged in a creative project with tangible technology kits make sense of the system feedback the technology provides. A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits.

AB  - Objective
Although sleep difficulties are common after spinal cord injury (SCI), little is known about how day-to-day fluctuations in sleep quality affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among these individuals. We examined the effect of sleep quality on same-day HRQOL using ecological momentary assessment methods over a 7-day period.
Design
Repeated-measures study involving 7 days of home monitoring; participants completed HRQOL measures each night and ecological momentary assessment ratings 3 times throughout the day; multilevel models were used to analyze data.
Setting
Two academic medical centers.
Participants
A total of 170 individuals with SCI (N=170).
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
Daily sleep quality was rated on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best) each morning. Participants completed end-of-day diaries each night that included several HRQOL measures (Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-related Impairment, Fatigue, Cognitive Abilities, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Depression, Anxiety) and ecological momentary assessment ratings of HRQOL (pain, fatigue, subjective thinking) 3 times throughout each day.
Results
Multilevel models indicated that fluctuations in sleep quality (as determined by end-of-day ratings) were significantly related to next-day ratings of HRQOL; sleep quality was related to other reports of sleep (Sleep Disturbance; Sleep-related Impairment; Fatigue) but not to other aspects of HRQOL. For ecological momentary assessment ratings, nights of poor sleep were related to worse pain, fatigue, and thinking. Generally, sleep quality showed consistent associations with fatigue and thinking across the day, but the association between sleep quality and these ecological momentary assessment ratings weakened over the course of the day.
Conclusions
Findings highlight the important association between sleep and HRQOL for people with SCI. Future work targeting sleep quality improvement may have positive downstream effects for improving HRQOL in people with SCI.

AB  - It has been discovered more than a decade ago that autistic people cannot properly understand and reproduce mental states and emotions. We hypothesize that people with autism suffer from difficulties in learning social rules from examples. Many remediation strategies have not taken this into account. Therefore an appropriate remediation strategy is to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it. In this study we suggest a reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a computer based mental simulator that is capable of modeling mental and emotional states of the real world. A model of the mental world is presented in 12 steps. We describe our implementation of a natural language multiagent system that simulates this model. In addition we describe the system’s user interface for autistic rehabilitation. This system is subject to short-term and long-term evaluation of rehabilitation of autistic reasoning. Case studies with children who used it extensively are presented. Implications specifically in terms of autistic rehabilitation as well as generally in terms of reasoning about mental states are discussed.

Educational disparities in Mathematics performance are a persistent challenge. This study aims to unravel the complex factors contributing to these disparities among students internationally, with a focus on the interpretability of the contributing factors.
Methodology:
Utilizing data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we conducted rigorous preprocessing and variable selection to prepare for applying binary classification interpretability models. These models were trained using the Stratified K-Fold technique to ensure balanced representation and assessed using six key metrics.
Solution:
By applying interpretability models such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, we identified critical factors impacting student performance, including reading accessibility, critical thinking skills, gender, and geographical location.
Results:
Our findings reveal significant disparities linked to resource availability, with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds possessing fewer books and demonstrating lower performance in Mathematics. The geographical analysis highlighted regional educational disparities, with certain areas consistently underperforming in PISA assessments. Gender also emerged as a determinant, with females contributing differently to performance levels across the spectrum.
Conclusion:
The study provides insights into the multifaceted determinants of student Mathematics performance and suggests potential avenues for future research to explore global interpretability models and further investigate the socioeconomic, cultural, and educational factors at play.

AB  - Optic ataxia (OA) is generally thought of as a disorder of visually guided reaching movements that cannot be explained by any simple deficit in visual or motor processing. In this paper we offer a new perspective on optic ataxia; we argue that the popular characterisation of this disorder is misleading and is unrepresentative of the pattern of reaching errors typically observed in OA patients. We begin our paper by reviewing recent neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and functional brain imaging studies that have led to the proposal that the medial parietal cortex in the vicinity of the parietal-occipital junction (POJ) – the key anatomical site associated with OA – represents reaching movements in eye-centred coordinates, and that this ability is impaired in optic ataxia. Our perspective stresses the importance of the POJ and superior parietal regions of the human PPC for representing reaching movements in both extrinsic (eye-centred) and intrinsic (postural) coordinates, and proposes that it is the ability to simultaneously represent multiple spatial locations that must be directly compared with one another that is impaired in non-foveal OA patients. In support of this idea we review recent fMRI and behavioural studies conducted by our group that have investigated the anatomical correlates of posturally guided movements, and the movements guided by postural cues in patients presenting with optic ataxia.

AB  - This paper studies the role of cognition and affect in decision-making as well as notions of Type 1 and 2 processes and behaviors typically used in dual process theories. In order to demonstrate that there is no 1:1 correspondence between types of observed behavior and internal processes causing them, and that Type 1 and Type 2 processes can be produced by a single system, we implemented a computational model integrating affective and cognitive processing. Our model is based on the model of Marinier, Laird, and Lewis (2009). We modified it by increasing the agent’s visual field, adding a GOFAI-style cognitive module (sub-goal management) and expanding the environment by a high-threat tile, to which the agent responds with a hard-wired automatic reaction. This allowed us to generate and observe different types of behavior and study interesting interactions between cognitive and affective control. By comparing our re-implementation to the modified agent, we demonstrated clear cases of Type 1 (fast, automatic) and Type 2 (slow, deliberative) behavior, providing further evidence for the “single-system, two processes” hypothesis.

AB  - Today's scientific progress would be unthinkable without theoretical and computational assistance. This holds true also for the solid-state sciences – which are without doubt a fundamental part of modern inorganic chemistry. This chapter is concerned mainly with first principles or ab initio quantum-chemical methods; the fundamental goal of solving Schrödinger's equation does not change upon going to extended systems, but there are some very important new ideas to consider. First, we describe these essential concepts; however, we do not, nor attempt to, provide an exhaustive overview of electronic-structure theory. Subsequently, we deal with simplifications, which are necessary to make quantum-chemical computations tractable and which possess special importance in the solid state. Simplifying ‘well’ is thus a vital part of any theorist's work. Finally, we describe applications – how chemists ‘see’ bonds in complicated structures, and how the computational toolkit may complement and enhance chemical concepts. They illustrate our most important message: how beautifully rock-solid theories and chemists' ingenious models blend in the solid state.

Yet, that development and its societal effects have been given minor attention in computing education in schools, which mainly focuses on rule-based programming. This article presents a pedagogical framework for supporting middle schoolers to become co-designers and makers of their own machine learning applications. It presents a case study conducted in the 6th grade of a Finnish elementary school and analyzes students’ (N=34) evolving ML ideas and explanations. Data consists of a children’s artwork, students’ design ideas and co-designed applications, and structured group interviews organized at the end of the ML project. The qualitative content analysis revealed how hands-on exploration with ML-based technologies supported students in developing various kinds of design ideas that harnessed face recognition, gestures, or voice recognition for solving real-life problems. The results of the study further indicated that co-designing ML applications provided a promising entry point for students to develop their conceptual understanding of ML principles, its workflows, and its role in their everyday practices. The article concludes with a discussion on how to support students to become innovators and software designers in the age of machine learning.

AB  - This paper addresses the implications of an emerging, increasingly important way of thinking about markets: systems thinking. A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets.

AB  - This mixed-method case study examined the potential of computer-assisted, math game making activities in facilitating design-based math learning for school children. Sixty-four middle school children participated in Scratch-based, math game making activities. Data were collected via activity and conversation observation, artifact analysis, interviewing, and survey. The study findings indicated that participants developed significantly more positive dispositions toward mathematics after computer game making. The study also found that experience-driven game design processes helped to activate children's reflection on everyday mathematical experiences. Mathematical thinking and content experience were intertwined within the process of computer game authoring. On the other hand, children designers were involved in game-world and story crafting more than mathematical representation. And it was still challenging for them to perform computer game coding with abstract reasoning.

AB  - Given the need for cleaner energy sources associated with the ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) policy, the work in question is a case study referring to the project to expand biomethane production in national territory, especially for industrial commercialization. By applying the Value Focused Thinking (VFT) methodology, the study initially seeks the approach based on the values of decision-makers, these being three professionals in the energy sector. After the central objective of supporting decision-making, the hybrid method PROMETHEE-SAPEVO-M1 was used, characterized by the possibility of evaluating quantitative data and qualitative variables. To this end, the modeling occurred through the software of the PROMETHEE-SAPEVO-M1 method to clarify the best plants, because of the range of possibilities in the national territory, for project implementation and subsequent production of biomethane for industrial use. As a result, we verified that São Paulo is the best alternative for applying the investment in biomethane production.

AB  - Undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students are often trained to use technical typesetting software in order to produce authentic mathematical prose, though little research exists about how this writing technology impacts students’ thinking and computation process. Drawing upon survey and interview research conducted at two liberal arts institutions, the authors investigate student writing practices across several undergraduate mathematics courses that required the use of LaTeX (a common markup language allowing users to specify the appearance of text and its layout on the printed page). This article presents findings about how the use of LaTeX slowed down students’ writing process, encouraging greater revision and reflection as well as allowing students to identify errors in their work at more than one stage in the process. We also explore the affective learning outcomes of STEM students using typesetting software, including increased feelings of confidence and professionalization. This article seeks to contribute to the growing conversation about how STEM students transfer knowledge about writing across disciplines.
