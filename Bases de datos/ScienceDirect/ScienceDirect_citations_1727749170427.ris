AB  - Prior investigations of functional specialization have focused on the response profiles of particular brain regions. Given the growing emphasis on regional covariation, we propose to reframe these questions in terms of brain ‘networks’ (collections of regions jointly engaged by some mental process). Despite the challenges that investigations of the language network face, a network approach may prove useful in understanding the cognitive architecture of language. We propose that a language network plausibly includes a functionally specialized ‘core’ (brain regions that coactivate with each other during language processing) and a domain-general ‘periphery’ (a set of brain regions that may coactivate with the language core regions at some times but with other specialized systems at other times, depending on task demands). Framing the debate around network properties such as this may prove to be a more fruitful way to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of language.

AB  - The Leadership Quarterly has helped as a pioneer in accepting Registered Reports (RRs), a submission format where authors provide the introduction, theory section, and methods of their paper for peer review before data collection. Proud but never satisfied, we aim to further boost the number of suitable RR submissions due to our firm belief in their potential for fostering transparent, high-impact research. To inspire authors to explore diverse data collection strategies and methods beyond experiments and survey-based (replication) studies, this work presents four distinct but equally suitable research formats for RRs: meta-analyses, qualitative research, computational approaches, and field intervention studies. Expanding prior research that has explored and promoted general practices and methodological standards for RRs, we offer unique recommendations for preparing an adequate RR proposal along each of these four RR avenues. Additionally, we provide a table of summary resources for authors, reviewers, and editors looking to engage more with RR. In conclusion, we envision a future where other top-tier journals and funding agencies follow The Leadership Quarterly by embracing the incorporation of RRs as a critical component of their strategic approach.

AB  - In this chapter, we introduce a proverbial crossroads in graduate and postgraduate education and jobs. We use medicinal chemistry as a core example for many topics, representative of what could also be said about pharmacology and other critical disciplines involved in drug discovery. Many factors are at play today for drug hunters, including an explosion of information, available now, at your fingertips, a move away from memorization toward critical thinking, the importance of learning by doing, and what has in the past been called “the gathering storm.” Core drug discovery disciplines are discussed, along with the importance of diversity and interdisciplinary skills and the value of academia-industry symbiosis. Challenges in making sure we continue to educate and engage the best and the brightest to tackle important biomedical problems are considered, especially in the context of personalized medicine and its interfaces with big data, bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, and more. Finally, we scratch the surface on how to navigate graduate school, postdocs, employers, and careers.

AB  - The locality issue of quantum mechanics is a key issue to a proper understanding of quantum physics and beyond. What has been commonly emphasized as quantum nonlocality has received an inspiring examination through the notion of the Heisenberg picture of quantum information. Deutsch and Hayden established a local description of quantum information in a setting of quantum information flow in a system of qubits. With the introduction of a slightly modified version of what we call the Deutsch–Hayden matrix values of observables, together with our recently introduced parallel notion of the noncommutative values from a more fundamental perspective, we clarify all the locality issues based on such values as quantum information carried by local observables in any given arbitrary state of a generic composite system. Quantum information as the ‘quantum’ values of observables gives a transparent conceptual picture of all that. Spatial locality for a projective measurement is also discussed. The pressing question is if and how such information for an entangled system can be retrieved through local processes which can only be addressed with new experimental thinking.

AB  - Abstract:
Knowledge complexity poses a problem to the modeller of representation and, in turn, of reasoning. We seek to overcome this problem by using our ‘privileged’ sense of vision. This means that we render dynamic, multi-modal phenomena as graphic depictions, be they technical visualizations, thought experiments, logic constructions or network graphs. The ‘graphic act’ has been described a being a fundamental activity in human perception, and both scientists and artists have undertaken advanced analyses of the human perception of nature based on visual experiments. Analysis based on reasoning is similarly a graphic act, in the sense that it seeks out patterns of connectivity among socio-spatial agents and entities. Reasoning also depends upon symbolism, which serves to overcome the problem of infinity in nature (a matter that lies at the heart of machine computation). Hence, this chapter introduces some elements in logical reasoning, set theory and computation, and outlines the particular importance of working with symbols. It also provides an introduction to data modelling with graphs, including current advances in graph databases. It provides some ‘tools for thinking’ about knowledge complexity and suggests the potential power in adapting these technologies to organize knowledge of dynamic, complex domains. It also introduces some standard methods for spatial data modelling, including powerful surface network models, which borrow from physical landscape analysis, to support reasoning about knowledge-driven domains.

AB  - Summary
A “technology lottery” describes a research idea or technology succeeding over others because it is suited to available software/hardware and not necessarily because it is superior. The nascent field of self-driving laboratories, particularly materials acceleration platforms (MAPs), is at risk: while it is logical and opportunistic to inject existing lab equipment and workflows with artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, such MAPs can constrain research by proliferating existing biases in science, mechatronics, and general-purpose computing. Rather than conformity, MAPs present opportunity to pursue new vectors of engineering physics with advances in cyber-physical learning and closed-loop, self-optimizing systems. We outline a simulation-based MAP program to design computers that use physics to solve optimization problems: the physical computing (PC)-MAP can mitigate hardware-software-substrate-user information losses present in all other MAP classes and eliminate lotteries by perfecting alignment between computing problems and media. We describe early PC advances and research pursuits toward optimal design of new materials and computing media.

AB  - Construction robotics has emerged as a leading technology in the construction industry. This paper conducts an innovative dual-track quantitative comprehensive method to analyze the current literature and assess future trends. First, a bibliometric review of 955 journal articles published between 1974 and 2023 was performed, exploring keywords, journals, countries, and clusters. Furthermore, a neural topic model based on BERTopic addresses topic modeling repetition issues. The study identifies building information modeling (BIM), human–robot collaboration (HRC), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as “three pillars” in the field. Additionally, we systematically reviewed the relevant literature and nested symbiotic relationships. The outcome of this study is twofold: first, the findings provide quantitative and qualitative scientific guidance for future research on trends; second, the innovative dual-track quantitative analysis research methodology simultaneously stimulates critical thinking about the modeling of other similarly trending topics characterized to avoid high degree of homogeneity and corpus overlap.

Most of the chapter is devoted to a set of VTDPs. These are descriptions of interactive visualization methods that have demonstrated value, together with a description of perceptual and cognitive issues relating to their use and guidelines for applicability. VDTPs provide a method for taking into account perceptual and cognitive issues in designing interaction especially with respect to key bottlenecks in the visual thinking process, such as limited visual working memory capacity. They also provide a way of reasoning about semiotic issues in perceptual terms via the concept of the visual query.

AB  - Enrollment in Computing Science university programs is at a dangerously low level. A major reason for this is the general lack of interest in Computing Science by females. In this paper, we discuss our experience with using a computer game construction environment as a vehicle to encourage female participation in Computing Science. Experiments with game construction in grade 10 English classes showed that females enjoyed this activity as much as males and were just as successful. In this paper, we argue that: a) computer game construction is a viable activity for teaching higher-order thinking skills that are essential for Science; b) computer game construction that involves scripting teaches valuable Computing Science abstraction skills; c) this activity is an enjoyable introduction to Computing Science; and d) outcome measures for this activity are not male-dominated in any of the three aspects (higher-order thinking, Computing Science abstraction skills, activity enjoyment). Therefore, we claim that this approach is a viable gender-neutral approach to teaching Computing Science in particular and Science in general that may increase female participation in the discipline.

AB  - Research on insight problem solving sets itself a challenging goal: How to explain the origin of a new idea. It compounds the difficulty of this challenge by traditionally seeking to explain the phenomenon in strictly mental terms. Rather, we suggest that thoughts and actions are bound to objects, inviting a granular description of the world within which thinking proceeds. As the reasoner transforms the world, the physical traces of these changes can be mapped in space and time. Not only can the reasoner see these changes, and act upon them, the researcher can develop new inscription devices that captures the trajectory of the creative arc along spatial and temporal coordinates. Kinenoetic is a term we employ to capture the idea that knowledge comes from the movement of objects and that this knowledge is both at the level of the problem-solver and at the level of the researcher. This form of knowledge can only be constructed in problem solving environments where reasoners can manipulate physical elements. A kinenoetic analysis tracks and maps the changes to the object-qua-models of proto solutions, and in the process unveils the physical genesis of new ideas and creativity. Our aim here is to lay out a method for using the objects commonly employed in interactive problem-solving research, tracing the process of thought to elucidate underlying cognitive mechanisms. Thus, the focus turns from the effects of objects on thoughts, to tracing object-thought mutualities as they are enacted and made visible.

AB  - In this work I introduce a simple model to study how natural selection acts upon aging, which focuses on the viability of each individual. It is able to reproduce the Gompertz law of mortality and can make predictions about the relation between the level of mutation rates (beneficial/deleterious/neutral), age at reproductive maturity and the degree of biological aging. With no mutations, a population with low age at reproductive maturity R stabilizes at higher density values, while with mutations it reaches its maximum density, because even for large pre-reproductive periods each individual evolves to survive to maturity. Species with very short pre-reproductive periods can only tolerate a small number of detrimental mutations. The probabilities of detrimental (Pd) or beneficial (Pb) mutations are demonstrated to greatly affect the process. High absolute values produce peaks in the viability of the population over time. Mutations combined with low selection pressure move the system towards weaker phenotypes. For low values in the ratio Pd/Pb, the speed at which aging occurs is almost independent of R, while higher values favor significantly species with high R. The value of R is critical to whether the population survives or dies out. The aging rate is controlled by Pd and Pb and the amount of the viability of each individual is modified, with neutral mutations allowing the system more “room” to evolve. The process of aging in this simple model is revealed to be fairly complex, yielding a rich variety of results.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is remarkable for the extent to which the same chromosomal abnormalities are detected in individual tumours. We have used next generation sequencing at low coverage to produce high resolution copy number karyograms of a series of 89 non-small cell lung tumours specifically of the squamous cell subtype. Because this methodology is able to create karyograms from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material, we were able to use archival stored samples for which survival data were available and correlate frequently occurring copy number changes with disease outcome. No single region of genomic change showed significant correlation with survival. However, adopting a whole-genome approach, we devised an algorithm that relates to total genomic damage, specifically the relative ratios of copy number states across the genome. This algorithm generated a novel index, which is an independent prognostic indicator in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

AB  - Based on multiple levels of granularity, the notion of sequential three-way granular computing focuses on a multiple stages of thinking, problem-solving, and information processing in threes. This paper interprets, represents, and implements sequential three-way granular computing by a framework of temporal-spatial multi-granularity learning, which is described with the temporality of data and the spatiality of parameters. In real-world decision-making, such a sequential approach is useful to make faster decisions for some objects with the lower cost of decision process and the acceptable accuracy when information is insufficient or unavailable. However, the cost of time-consuming computation for hierarchical multilevel granularity is our concern. To address this issue, we utilize a local strategy to accelerate a sequence of neighborhood-based granulation induced by Gaussian kernel function. Subsequently, local three-way decision rules are investigated based on the Bayesian minimum risk criterion. Moreover, by the construction of a novel local trisection model, we propose a local sequential approach of three-way granular computing under a temporal-spatial multilevel granular structure. Finally, a series of comparative experiments between global and local perspectives is carried out to verify the effectiveness of our proposed models.

AB  - Increasing Internet of Things (IoT) device connectivity makes botnet attacks more dangerous, carrying catastrophic hazards. As IoT botnets evolve, their dynamic and multifaceted nature hampers conventional detection methods. This paper proposes a risk assessment framework based on fuzzy logic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the risks associated with IoT botnets. Fuzzy logic addresses IoT threat uncertainties and ambiguities methodically. Fuzzy component settings are optimized using PSO to improve accuracy. The methodology allows for more complex thinking by transitioning from binary to continuous assessment. Instead of expert inputs, PSO data-driven tunes rules and membership functions. This study presents a complete IoT botnet risk assessment system. The methodology helps security teams allocate resources by categorizing threats as high, medium, or low severity. This study shows how CICIoT2023 can assess cyber risks. Our research has implications beyond detection, as it provides a proactive approach to risk management and promotes the development of more secure IoT environments.

AB  - For companies to stand out in increasingly competitive, dynamic and global markets, they must have customer satisfaction goals, create value through their processes, products and services and also aim for innovation. In this context, computer sciences combined with engineering processes constitutes a powerful way for companies to be able to improve process management, to interact with such markets in an efficient and effective way. The main objective of this article is to use Arena simulation software, to quantitatively predict the impact of improvements applied in metal surface treatment processes, based on tools to support Lean thinking. A case study in a Portuguese company in the metalworking sector is presented, in which it is verified that the proposed improvements in terms of the factory layout and resource management, suggested by the comparison between simulations of the current state of the company and the improved one, streamline the processes of finishing in metals, namely zinc coating and lacquering which prevent the occurrence of oxidation and the consequent corrosion of the base metals, by adding other metals and materials to their surface, which adhere and protect it. Through the results obtained, it is concluded that the reduction of waiting times and transport of stocks without production and of work-in-progress, as well as the increase of the productive capacity, make the company more able to guarantee the satisfaction of the requirements of its customers and improve its positioning in the market compared to its competitors.

AB  - In this chapter on graduate and professional education, we explore doctoral and professional programs, posing a number of key questions you should ask yourself. Where to apply to graduate school or a postdoc, and why? With whom should you work? A PhD or a PharmD? What must you do to be successful? Moreover, we touch on traits important to becoming an independent researcher and ask whether success in graduate school or a postdoctoral fellowship requires different skills than undergraduate degrees. Critical thinking habits underpin this discussion. We outline possible career choices—jobs!—touching on the knowledge and expertise used by drug hunters, and also ask what might be of most value to potential employers. Each of us is different, and what’s best for you is something you will have to decipher, but hopefully you will consult with family, friends, and advisors or mentors before making a final decision. Regardless, “the big leap” is coming, so get ready.

AB  - The complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1) plays a significant role in mathematics, physics and engineering. There is no simple formula for its computation, thus numerical algorithms are essential for coping with the practical problems involved. The commercial implementations for the numerical solutions, such as the functions ellipticK and EllipticK provided by MATLAB and Mathematica respectively, are based on Kcs(m) instead of the usual form K(k) such that Kcs(k2)=K(k) and m=k2. It is necessary to develop open source implementations for the computation of the CEI-1 in order to avoid potential risks of using commercial software and possible limitations due to the unknown factors. In this paper, the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss–Chebyshev method and Gauss–Legendre methods are discussed in details with a top-down strategy. The four key algorithms for computing the CEI-1 are designed, verified, validated and tested, which can be utilized in R& D and be reused properly. Numerical results show that our open source implementations based on K(k) are equivalent to the commercial implementation based on Kcs(m). The general algorithms for computing orthogonal polynomials developed are valuable for the STEM education and scientific computation.

AB  - The prediction of surface ozone is essential attributing to its impact on human and environmental health. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are crucial in driving ozone concentration; particularly in urban areas where VOC limited regimes are prominent. The limited measurements of VOCs, however, hinder assessing the VOC-ozone relationship. This work applies machine learning (ML) algorithms for temporal forecasting of surface ozone over a metropolitan city in India. The availability of continuous VOCs measurement data along with meteorology and other pollutants during 2014–2016 makes it possible to deduce the influence of various input parameters on surface ozone prediction. After evaluating the best ML model for ozone prediction, simulations were carried out using varied input combinations. The combination with isoprene, meteorology, NOx, and CO (Isop + MNC) was the best with RMSE 4.41 ppbv and MAPE 6.77%. A season-wise comparison of simulations having all data, only meteorological data and Isop + MNC as input showed that Isop + MNC simulation gives the best results during the summer season (RMSE: 5.86 ppbv, MAPE: 7.05%). This shows the increased ability of the model to capture ozone peaks (high ozone during summer) relatively better when isoprene data is used. The overall results highlight that using all available data doesn't necessarily give best prediction results; also critical thinking is essential when evaluating the model results.

AB  - This study is the first to compare in the same subjects the specific spatial distribution and the functional and anatomical connectivity of the neuronal resources that activate and integrate syntactic representations during music and language processing. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tractography, we examined the brain network involved in the recognition and integration of words and chords that were not hierarchically related to the preceding syntax; that is, those deviating from the universal principles of grammar and tonal relatedness. This kind of syntactic processing in both domains was found to rely on a shared network in the left hemisphere centered on the inferior part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), including pars opercularis and pars triangularis, and on dorsal and ventral long association tracts connecting this brain area with temporo-parietal regions. Language processing utilized some adjacent left hemispheric IFG and middle temporal regions more than music processing, and music processing also involved right hemisphere regions not activated in language processing. Our data indicate that a dual-stream system with dorsal and ventral long association tracts centered on a functionally and structurally highly differentiated left IFG is pivotal for domain–general syntactic competence over a broad range of elements including words and chords.

AB  - Present classification systems for thought disorder lack consistency and require one to remember long-winded definitions limiting their use to research settings. As an extension of recent work in this area (World Congress, 2008), we classify the characteristic thought disorder patterns seen in schizophrenia according to the location of the lesion in notional "threads" of mental computational processes that string speech together. These threads must take both semantics and syntax into consideration in performing their function. When we speak - just as when we write - there is a natural hierarchy topic thread (the topic of the ‘essay’) and multiples of paragraph threads, sentence threads, clause threads, word threads and phoneme threads. Intuitively, we grade the severity of thought disorder depending upon whether a particular thread gets stuck (S), reconnects abnormally (R) or is absent altogether: I.paragraph thread R: Disjointed sentences S: Circumstantiality;II.topic threadR: Tangentiality S: Preoccupatory thinking;III.sentence threads R: Knight's move thinking S: Clause perseveration;IV.clause threads R: Word salad S: Word perseveration, fusion;V.word threads R: Incoherent sounds/ neologisms/ paraphasias S: Phoneme/syllable perseveration;VI.phoneme threads - Failure of production: Mutism.Of course, one must record all the lesions that are present at any given time. This scale incorporates a intuitive progression from mild to severe thought disorder in Schizophrenia. Using the STDS would allow the straightforward ‘bedside’ quantification of the severity of thought disorder and enforce discipline into the thought assessment section of the Mental State Examination.

These efforts require an environment that values the individual student and integrates recent advances from the primary literature in the discipline, experimentally directed research, data collection and analysis, and scientific writing. Current trends shaping these efforts must include critical thinking, experimental testing, computational modeling, and inferential logic. In essence, modern biochemistry and molecular biology education must be informed by, and integrated with, cutting-edge research. This environment relies on sustained research support, commitment to providing the requisite mentoring, access to instrumentation, and state-of-the-art facilities. The academic environment must establish a culture of excellence and faculty engagement, leading to innovation in the classroom and laboratory. These efforts must not lose sight of the importance of multidimensional programs that enrich science literacy in all facets of the population, students and teachers in K-12 schools, nonbiochemistry and molecular biology students, and other stakeholders. As biochemistry and molecular biology educators, we have an obligation to provide students with the skills that allow them to be innovative and self-reliant. The next generation of biochemistry and molecular biology students must be taught proficiencies in scientific and technological literacy, the importance of the scientific discourse, and skills required for problem solvers of the 21st century.

Reflex elements, kinematic primitives, muscle synergies, force-field primitives and/or pattern generators all have experimental support as modular elements. We discuss the possible relations of force-field primitives, spinal feedback systems, and pattern generation and shaping systems in detail, and review methods for examining underlying motor pattern structure in intact or semi-intact behaving animals. The divisions of systems into primitives, synergies, and rhythmic elements or oscillators suggest specific functions and methods of construction of movement. We briefly discuss the limitations and caveats needed in these interpretations given current knowledge, together with some of the hypotheses arising from these frameworks.

AB  - In recent decades, hypnosis has increasingly moved into the mainstream of scientific inquiry. Hypnotic suggestions are frequently implemented in behavioral, neurocognitive, and clinical investigations and interventions. Despite abundant reports about the effectiveness of suggestions in altering behavior, perception, cognition, and agency, no consensus exists regarding the mechanisms driving these changes. This article reviews competing theoretical accounts that address the genesis of subjective, behavioral, and neurophysiological responses to hypnotic suggestions. We systematically analyze the broad landscape of hypnosis theories that best represent our estimation of the current status and future avenues of scientific thinking. We start with procedural descriptions of hypnosis, suggestions, and hypnotizability, followed by a comparative analysis of systematically selected theories. Considering that prominent theoretical perspectives emphasize different aspects of hypnosis, our review reveals that each perspective possesses salient strengths, limitations, and heuristic values. We highlight the necessity of revisiting extant theories and formulating novel evidence-based accounts of hypnosis.

These competencies are then compared to the learning outcomes established in the guide for programs accreditation of the Institution of Chemical Engineers. To provide practical examples of how the competency-based approach was incorporated into the program, three specific cases are presented. The first case focuses on the implementation of the internship and industry project. The second case illustrates the incorporation of computational tools as an essential part of different courses throughout the degree program. Finally, the third case describes a new design for the fluid mechanics laboratory that emphasizes hands-on learning and helps students develop several competencies.

Here we show why accommodating intelligent sensory augmentation devices not just improves but also changes the way of thinking and classifying former sensory augmentation devices. We review the benefits in terms of signal processing and show why non-linear transformation is more than a mere improvement compared to classical linear transformation.

AB  - This paper presents a novel evolutionary design approach in a multi-agent design environment. Multi-agent system architecture offers a promising framework for dynamically managing cooperative agents in a distributed environment while the tree structure based generic algorithm provides a foundation for supporting evolutionary and innovative design abilities. Design is a complex knowledge discovery process. Creative design is a human trait that is not easily converted into a computational tool. Rather than to implement the innovative design by computers, this environment is used to stimulate the imagination of designers and extend their thinking space. It wants to explore a feasible and useful evolutionary approach in a distributed environment that will give the designers concrete help for the creative designs. This approach is illustrated by a mobile phone design example, which used binary algebraic expression tree to form sketch shapes and a feature based product tree to produce component combination choices. Because evolution is guided by human selectors, the evolutionary algorithm is not complex. It shows that approach is able to generate some creative solutions, demonstrating the power of explorative evolution.

AB  - Linguistic self-representation and identity construction on social media have attracted much scholarly attention. However, relevant studies tend to overlook the temporal dimension of social media, potentially systematic patterning of linguistic behavior across time, and the attendant implications of such a temporal perspective on identity. Combining an automated lexical tool (LIWC) and the Box–Jenkins method of statistical time series analysis, this paper shows how the ‘modelability’ of linguistic choices across time can be interpreted as signatures of identity construction and complement existing frameworks for identity analysis. Two levels of modelability are discussed—the availability of a well-fitting time series model as evidence of temporal patterning, and specific parameters of that model interpreted in context. These are demonstrated with a case study of the construction of ‘amateur expertise’ over 109 consecutive makeup tutorial videos on the popular YouTube channel ‘Nikkiestutorials’. Results show that the linguistic display of ‘analytical thinking’ reflects a strategy of ‘short term momentum’, the display of ‘clout’ and ‘authenticity’ a strategy of ‘short term restoration’, while the display of ‘emotional tone’ fluctuates randomly across time. The approach is further discussed in terms of its general principles and potential applications in other contexts of identity and related research.

AB  - An ordinary differential equation (ODE) form of the radial return algorithm, which is essentially a Prandtl-Reuss material model, is combined with a strain-rate hardening model to produce an ODE that describes deviatoric stress through a prescribed density rise. An analytical solution is found to the resulting ODE for a specific choice of one of the hardening model’s parameters. That solution is used to prove that if the prescribed density rise is allowed to be infinitely thin, i.e., like a shock in the mathematical sense, the resulting deviatoric stress is still bounded. In other words, the singularity is integrable; integration of the radial return ODE regularizes the infinite strain rate and resulting yield stress in the presence of an ideal shock singularity. The analytical tools developed for this line of thinking are applied to study the variation of deviatoric stress through a nearly shock-like density rise using different density rise profiles, revealing the impact of the shape choice. The tools are also used to compute what rise times are needed to converge upon the correct value of deviatoric stress through a shock; the results indicate that most contemporary hydrocodes cannot be expected to achieve those rise times. A demonstration of connecting the analytical tools to a hydrocode, using surrogate numerical shock shapes, is provided thereby opening the door for using such surrogates to perform sub-grid computations of converged shock behavior for strain-rate hardening materials.

AB  - Attribute reduction, as a technique for selecting qualified attributes which can satisfy the intended constraint related to considered measure, has been widely explored. Notably, one and only one reduct is derived through using one searching strategy in most cases. Nevertheless, only one reduct may be not enough for us to evaluate its effectiveness. To fill such gap, an approach of crosswise computing reduct is proposed for obtaining multiple reducts. The computation of reduct is realized through partitioning the whole data into several groups, and crosswise selecting some groups to form different subsets of data, then computing reducts over these different subsets of data. Moreover, to speed up the process of crosswise computing reduct, an acceleration strategy is designed. The main thinking of our acceleration strategy is to compute the reduct over different subsets of data on the basis of reduct over the whole data. The experimental results over 16 data sets show the following superiorities of our strategy: (1) our approach can decrease the elapsed time of crosswise computing reducts significantly; (2) our approach can not only provide reduct with higher stability, but also maintain the classification performance; (3) the attributes in reduct can provide more stable classification results.

AB  - In 1965, Woodward and Hoffmann proposed a theory to predict the stereochemistry of electrocyclic reactions, which, after expansion and generalization, became known as the Woodward–Hoffmann Rules. Subsequently, Longuet-Higgins and Abrahamson used correlation diagrams to propose that the stereoselectivity of electrocyclizations could be explained by the correlation of reactant and product orbitals with the same symmetry. Immediately thereafter, Hoffmann and Woodward applied correlation diagrams to explain the mechanism of cycloadditions. We describe these discoveries and their evolution. We now report an investigation of various electrocyclic reactions using DFT and CASSCF. We track the frontier molecular orbitals along the intrinsic reaction coordinate and modeled trajectories and examine the correlation between HOMO and LUMO for thermally forbidden systems. We also investigate the electrocyclizations of several highly polarized systems for which the Houk group had predicted that donor–acceptor substitution can induce zwitterionic character, thereby providing low-energy pathways for formally forbidden reactions. We conclude with perspectives on the field of pericyclic reactions, including a refinement as the meaning of Woodward and Hoffmann’s “Violations. There are none!” Lastly, we comment on the burgeoning influence of computations on all fields of chemistry.

AB  - Using diffusion to define distances between points on a manifold (or a sampled data set) has been successfully employed in various applications such as data organization and approximately isometric embedding of high dimensional data in low dimensional Euclidean space. Recently, P. Jones has proposed a diffusion distance which is both intuitively appealing and scales appropriately with increasing time. In the first part of our paper, we present an efficient tree-based approach to computing an approximation to Jonesʼs diffusion distance. We also show our approximation is comparable to Jonesʼs distance. Neither Jonesʼs distance, nor our approximation, satisfies the triangle inequality; in particular, in the case of heat flow on Rn, Jonesʼs separation distance gives a scaled square of the Euclidean distance. In the second part of our paper, we present a general construction to obtain an “almost” metric from a general distance. We also discuss a numerical procedure to implement our construction. Additionally, we show that in the case of heat flow on Rn, we recover (scaled) Euclidean distance from Jonesʼs distance.

AB  - The aim of the study is to describe a methodological approach to represent, interpret, model and manage pluristratified archaeological contexts. The proposed methodology envisages a digital workflow, a BIM-thinking strategy, which integrates geometric and texture data obtained from laser and photogrammetric scans with information about construction techniques and materials, archaeological reports and documentation. The integration is based on a balanced combination of open-source and proprietary solutions, allowing professionals to work with their “comfort software” and assuring interoperability through the adoption of Open Standards. Experimentations are being conducted exploring the potential of connecting semantic 3D modelling and virtual reconstructions based on archaeological data made with Blender and the Extended Matrix Tool, with BIM software and capabilities thanks to the BlenderBIM addon. The proposed workflow, in combination with the described data-sharing-oriented process, adopts a new approach towards 3D models in order to promote a more sustainable mindset towards 3D dataset life-cycle by optimizing their usage and reducing waste on different levels, such as re-documenting the same structure twice. The expected overall result is the ability to generate semantic models that can enhance our understanding of the context as much as foster multidisciplinary BIM (Building Information Modelling) collaboration thus improving archaeological research, documentation and conservation practices.

AB  - Dealing with molecular-state transitions for radiative transfer purposes involves two successive steps that both reach the complexity level at which physicists start thinking about statistical approaches: (1) constructing line-shaped absorption spectra as the result of very numerous state-transitions, (2) integrating over optical-path domains. For the first time, we show here how these steps can be addressed simultaneously using the null-collision concept. This opens the door to the design of Monte Carlo codes directly estimating radiative transfer observables from spectroscopic databases. The intermediate step of producing accurate high-resolution absorption spectra is no longer required. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed and applied to six one-dimensional test cases. It allows the computation of spectrally integrated intensities (over 25cm−1 bands or the full IR range) in a few seconds, regardless of the retained database and line model. But free parameters need to be selected and they impact the convergence. A first possible selection is provided in full detail. We observe that this selection is highly satisfactory for quite distinct atmospheric and combustion configurations, but a more systematic exploration is still in progress.

This work aims to create an automatic detection process of cardiac structures in both short-axis and long-axis views. A workflow inspired by human thinking process, for better explainability.
Methods
we began by separating the images into two classes: long axis and short axis, using a Residual Network model. Then, we used Particle Swarm Optimization for general segmentation. After segmentation, a characterization step based on shape descriptors calculated from bounding box and ANOVA for features selection were applied on the binary images to detect the location of each region of interest: lung, left and right ventricle in the short-axis view, the aorta, the left heart (left atrium and ventricle), and the right heart (right atrium and ventricle) in the long axis view.
Results
we achieved a 90% accuracy on view separation. We have selected: Elongation, Compactness, Circularity, Type Factor, for short axis identification; and:Area, Centre of Mass Y, Moment of Inertia XY, Moment of Inertia YY, for long axis identification.
Conclusion
a successful separation of long axis and short axis views allows for a better characterization and detection of segmented cardiac structures. After that, any method can be applied for segmentation, attribute selection, and classification.
Significance
an attempt to introduce explainability into cardiac image segmentation, we tried to mimic the human workflow while computerizing each step. The process seems to be valid and added clarity and interpretability to the detection.

AB  - A long tradition of research in theoretical, experimental and computational pragmatics has investigated over-specification and under-specification in referring expressions. Along broadly Gricean lines, these studies compare the amount of information expressed by a referring expression against the amount of information that is required. Often, however, these studies offer no formal definition of what “required” means, and how the comparison should be performed. In this paper, we use a simple set-theoretic perspective to define some communicatively important types of over-/under-specification. We argue that our perspective enables an enhanced understanding of reference phenomena that can pay important dividends for the analysis of reference in corpora and for the evaluation of computational models of referring. To illustrate and substantiate our claims, we analyse two corpora, containing Chinese and English referring expressions respectively, using the new perspective. The results show that interesting new monolingual and cross-linguistic insights can be obtained from our perspective.

AB  - When solving problems, like making predictions or choices, people often “sample” possibilities into mind. Here, we consider whether there is structure to the kinds of thoughts people sample by default—that is, without an explicit goal. Across three experiments we found that what comes to mind by default are samples from a probability distribution that combines what people think is likely and what they think is good. Experiment 1 found that the first quantities that come to mind for everyday behaviors and events are quantities that combine what is average and ideal. Experiment 2 found, in a manipulated context, that the distribution of numbers that come to mind resemble the mathematical product of the presented statistical distribution and a (softmax-transformed) prescriptive distribution. Experiment 3 replicated these findings in a visual domain. These results provide insight into the process generating people’s conscious thoughts and invite new questions about the value of thinking about things that are both likely and good.

The goal of the GDL initiative is to leverage students' interests in games and design to foster their problem-solving and critical reasoning skills. The present study examines the effectiveness of an after-school version of the GDL program using a quasi-experimental design. Students enrolled in the GDL program were guided in the process of designing games aimed at solving problems. Compared to students in a control group who did not attend the program (n = 24), the children who attended the GDL program (n = 20) showed a significant increase in their problem-solving skills. The results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that participation in the GDL program leads to measurable cognitive changes in children's problem-solving skills. This study bears important implications for educators and theory.

AB  - We introduce a novel detailed conductance-based model of the bursting activity in external tufted (ET) cells of the olfactory bulb. We investigate the mechanisms underlying their bursting, and make experimentally-testable predictions. The ionic currents included in the model are specific to ET cells, and their kinetic and other parameters are based on experimental recordings. We validate the model by showing that its bursting characteristics under various conditions (e.g. blocking various currents) are consistent with experimental observations. Further, we identify the bifurcation structure and dynamics that explain bursting behavior. This analysis allows us to make predictions of the response of the cell to current pulses at different burst phases. We find that depolarizing (but not hyperpolarizing) inputs received during the interburst interval can advance burst timing, creating the substrate for synchronization by excitatory connections. It has been hypothesized that such synchronization among the ET cells within one glomerulus might help coordinate the glomerular output. Next we investigate model parameter sensitivity and identify parameters that play the most prominent role in controlling each burst characteristic, such as the burst frequency and duration. Finally, the response of the cell to periodic inputs is examined, reflecting the sniffing-modulated input that these cell receive in vivo. We find that individual cells can be better entrained by inputs with higher, rather than lower, frequencies than the intrinsic bursting frequency of the cell. Nevertheless, a heterogeneous population of ET cells (as may be found in a glomerulus) is able to produce reliable periodic population responses even at lower input frequencies.

AB  - In this paper, we study secure computing migration scenarios in uncertain environments with the presence of multiple malicious eavesdroppers (MEs). Specifically, when edge servers (ESs) execute tasks delivered by smart devices (SDs), SDs may move beyond the coverage of ESs, and computing migration (CM) of unfinished tasks is required to ensure service continuity. There is a risk of privacy leakage during task migration, and MEs use colluding eavesdropping to eavesdrop on the migrated tasks, and we consider eavesdropping on the associated tasks through data sharing among MEs to improve the eavesdropping efficiency. For eavesdropping in MEs, we achieve eavesdropping strikes using cooperative interference by jammers, which benefit by providing jamming services. In addition, uncertain computational scenarios directly affect the efficiency of task execution, and we consider the uncertainty factor in the malicious eavesdropping environment. To this end, this paper proposes the secure computational migration of associative privacy in uncertain environments (SCMAPUE) model, which transforms uncertainties into interval parameters, and optimizes the five objectives of migration delay, maximum completion time, energy consumption, load balancing and migration reliability to achieve efficient task execution and reliable migration. Aiming at the model characteristics, this paper designs an interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm for reliable migration (IMaOEA-RM), which employs a condition-based interval confidence strategy and a multi-access secure migration selection strategy to improve the convergence of the algorithm, and utilizes a dual-migration crossover strategy in order to adjust the jammer partners and improve the population diversity. Simulation results show that our proposed IMaOEA-RM algorithm can provide a more reliable and efficient migration scheme than existing algorithms.

AB  - Achieving the objectives of sustainable development in water and agri-food systems requires the utilisation of decision-support tools in stakeholder-driven processes to construct and simulate various scenarios and evaluate the outcomes of associated policy interventions. While it is common practice to involve stakeholders in participatory modelling processes, their comprehensive documentation and the lessons learned remain scarce. In this paper, we share our experience of engaging stakeholders throughout the entire system dynamics modelling process. We draw on two projects implemented in the Volta River Basin, West Africa, to understand the dynamics of water and agri-food systems under changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions. We outline eight key insights and lessons as practical guides derived from each stage of the participatory modelling process, including the pre-workshop stage, problem definition, model conceptualization, simulation model formulation, model testing and verification, and policy design and evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders can actively contribute to all phases of the system dynamics modelling process, including parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and numerical simulation experiments. However, we encountered notable challenges, including the time-intensive nature of the process, the struggle to reach a consensus on the modelled problem, and the difficulty of translating the conceptual model into a simulation model using stock and flow diagrams – all of which were addressed through a structured facilitation process. While the projects were anchored in the specific context of West Africa, the key lessons and insights highlighted have broader significance, particularly for researchers employing PSDM in regions characterised by multifaceted human-environmental systems and where stakeholder involvement is crucial for holistic understanding and effective policy interventions. This paper contributes practical guidance for future efforts with participatory modelling, particularly in regions worldwide grappling with sustainable development challenges in water and agri-food systems, and where stakeholder involvement is crucial for holistic understanding of the multiple challenges and for designing effective policy interventions.

AB  - The crisis spurred by the pandemic of COVID-19 has revealed weaknesses in our epidemiologic methodologic corpus, which scientists are struggling to compensate. This article explores whether this phenomenon is characteristic of pandemics or not. Since the emergence of population-based sciences in the 17th century, we can observe close temporal correlations between the plague and the discovery of population thinking, cholera and population-based group comparisons, tuberculosis and the formalization of cohort studies, the 1918 Great Influenza and the creation of an academic epidemiologic counterpart to the public health service, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the formalization of causal inference concepts. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have promoted the widespread understanding of population thinking both with respect to ways of flattening an epidemic curve and the societal bases of health inequities. If the latter proves true, it will support my hypothesis that pandemics did accelerate profound changes in epidemiologic methods and concepts.

Two pumping mechanisms are considered in detail by way of example: one of a simple tube, which represents a embryonic fish heart and another more complicated structure with the potential to model the adult human heart. Through finite element modeling different elastic contractions are induced in the band. For each version the pumping efficiency is measured and the dynamics are evaluated. We show that by combining helical shapes of muscle bands with a contraction wave it is possible not only to achieve efficient pumping, but also to create desired dynamics of the structure. As a result we match the function of the model pumps and their dynamics to physiological observations.

AB  - A multi-granularity knowledge space is a computational model that simulates human thinking and solves complex problems. However, as the amount of data increases, the multi-granularity knowledge space will have a larger number of layers, which will reduce its problem-solving ability. Therefore, we define a knowledge space distance measurement and propose two algorithms to select k representative layers from the multi-granularity knowledge space, where k is specified by the user according to the needs in problem solving, and k representative layers are approximately equidistant. First, we propose a knowledge space distance to measure the distance between any two layers in a multi-granularity knowledge space with superset-subset relationships, and the rationality of the knowledge space distance is verified by theory and experiment. Second, relying on the knowledge space distance and knowledge space distance variance, we propose two algorithms (i.e., a deterministic algorithm and a heuristic algorithm) to select an approximate equidistant k-layer multi-granularity knowledge space. Third, in addition to verifying the effectiveness of the knowledge space distance, the knowledge space distance variance, the deterministic algorithm and the heuristic algorithm, we verify that the equidistant k-layer multi-granularity knowledge space is more efficient than the original multi-granularity knowledge space.

AB  - When products come to the end of their lives, the materials they contain are still there. Repurposing, repair or recycling can return them to active use, creating a technological cycle that, in some ways, parallels the carbon, nitrogen and hydrological cycles of the biosphere. In developed nations they lost urgency as the cost of materials fell and that of labour rose, making it cheaper to make new products than to fix old ones, leading to a materials economy that is largely linear, characterized by the sequence “take – make – use – dispose”. Increasing population and affluence, and the limited capacity for the planet to provide resources and absorb waste direct thinking towards a more circular way of using materials. Governments have sought to reduce waste by imposing take-back regulations, setting mandatory recycling targets and requiring minimum service lives. These, and the efficiency movement – eco-efficiency, material-efficiency, energy efficiency – seek to allow business as usual with reduced drain on natural resources without any real change of behaviour. The ‘circularity’ concept is a way of thinking that looks not just for efficiencies but also for new ways to provide functions. The idea of deploying rather than consuming materials, of using them not once but many times has economic as well as environmental appeal. This chapter examines the background, the successes, the difficulties, and the ultimate limits of implementing a circular materials economy.

AB  - In the subject of smart sustainable cities, the underlying theories are a foundation for practice. Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.

AB  - The current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which disrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems. We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing social system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.

AB  - Nowadays, quantum computing has reached the engineering phase, with fully-functional quantum processors integrating hundreds of noisy qubits. Yet – to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the labs into the business reality – the challenge ahead is to substantially scale the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding thousands of fault-tolerant qubits. To this aim, the distributed quantum computing paradigm is recognized as the key solution for scaling the number of qubits. Indeed, accordingly to such a paradigm, multiple small-to-moderate-scale quantum processors communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks exceeding the computational power of single processing devices. The aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising with distributed quantum computing from a computer and communications engineering perspective. Furthermore, this survey provides an easy access and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results in the field.

AB  - There is growing attention on the importance of building intelligent systems where humans and Artificial Intelligence-based systems (AIs) form teams exploiting the potentially synergistic relationships between humans and automation. In the last decade, the computational modeling of empathy has gained increasing attention. Empowering interactive agents with empathic capabilities leads, on the human’s side, to more trust, increases engagement, and thus interaction length, helps cope with stress. These findings suggest that agents endowed with empathy may enhance social interaction in educational applications, artificial companions, medical assistants, and gaming applications. This article focuses on modeling the empathic behavior of virtual agents interacting with humans. We propose a formal model that enables virtual agents to exhibit empathic, emotional behavior. Specifically, we extend the modeling of empathy via behavior trees with a new type of node allowing the specification of various kinds of empathy. Using the proposed extension, we show how different agents’ reactive behavior can be modeled.

AB  - This research was conducted to confirm the feasibility of a STEAM education program in which the mathematics, physics, and Korean traditional arts underlying the hanok roofline are investigated using educational tools of GeoGebra and 4Dframe. This paper contends that this program has the potential to engage students in knowledge restructuring regarding the perception of the hanok’s architectural beauty, Newton's concept of gravity, and mathematical functions. The Octagonal Pavilion in Tapgol Park in Seoul, South Korea, a representative hanok, was used as an educational resource. GeoGebra is used to determine that the roofline of the Octagonal Pavilion generally follows the formula of the catenary curve and then the roofline is modelled using 4Dframe. The catenary form of the roofline of the hanok is linked to the Korean sense of beauty in the pursuit of naturalness under the influence of gravity and organically harmonizes with the environment. The class described in this study, in which the curve of the roofline of the Octagonal Pavilion is explored using GeoGebra and 4Dframe, can help develop creative and critical thinking in students in the context of STEAM education. The findings of this study have the potential to expand the scope of STEAM education to include content for creative education.

KW  - Algebraic habits of mind
KW  - mobile puzzles
KW  - Symbol sense
AB  - Given the growing concern for developing students’ algebraic ideas and thinking in earlier grades (NCTM, 2000) it is important for students to have experiences that better prepare them for their formal introduction to algebra. Mobile puzzles seem to be an opportunity for exhibiting certain algebraic habits of mind as well as for demonstrating symbol-sense which might support students in their transition from arithmetic to algebra. These puzzles include multiple balanced collections of objects whose weights must be determined by the solver. The arms/beams must be perfectly balanced for it to hang properly. Therefore, they represent, in a pictorial way, systems of equations. Each arm/beam that balances two sets of objects (representing variables as unknown “weights”) represents an equation. The data derived from Grade-6 students who were asked to solve a collection of tasks reflect the presence of the “Puzzling and Persevering” and “Seeking and Using Structure” habits of mind. At the same time these data incorporate instances of some main components of symbol-sense such as “friendliness with symbols”, “manipulating and ‘reading through’ symbolic expressions”, and “choice of symbols”. Also discussed is the way this experience contributes to an intuitive application of the conventional rules for solving equations that will be later introduced to the students as the standard algebraic “moves”.

AB  - Mindwandering (MW) is associated with both positive and negative outcomes. Among the latter, negative mood and negative cognitions have been reported. However, the underlying mechanisms linking mindwandering to negative mood and cognition are still unclear. We hypothesized that MW could either directly enhance negative thinking or indirectly heighten the accessibility of negative thoughts. In an undergraduate sample (n=79) we measured emotional thoughts during the Sustained Attention on Response Task (SART) which induces MW, and accessibility of negative cognitions by means of the Scrambled Sentences Task (SST) after the task. We also measured depressive symptoms and rumination. Results show that in individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms MW during SART predicts higher accessibility of negative thoughts after the task, rather than negative thinking during the task. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of MW and provide insight into the relationship between task-involvement and affect.

AB  - This paper explores that natural relationships between Pragmatic theory of knowing, the dynamic structuring of the mind and thinking suggested by connectionist theory, and the way information is distributed and organized through the world wide web (www). We suggest that these three “innovations” can be brought together to offer a better understanding of the way the human mind works. The internet and the information revolution may finally offer the opportunity to use and develop inductive learning practices and information based social inquiry in ways Pragmatic philosophers envisioned a hundred years ago, while the recent rise of connectionist and cognitive architecture works provides a concrete context for such developments. This confluence of process represents the type of synergy that only history can offer. The information revolution – exemplified by both the rise of connectionism and the internet – is the apotheosis of the Pragmatic revolution – bringing together radical empiricism and democratization of information in community practice. We offer three important realizations in our understanding of how information is organized and thinking progresses made possible by burgeoning virtual communities on the internet – open source thinking, scale-free networks, and interrelationships in the development of blogs to illustrate our thesis.

AB  - The digital transformation (DT) is not only forcing companies to rethink their business models but is also challenging governments to address the question of how information technology will change society today and in the future. By setting the legal boundaries and acting as an investor and promoter of the domestic digital economy, governments actively influence in which ways this transformational process takes place. The vision and objectives how DT should be realized on state level is portrayed in well-crafted DT policies. Yet, little is known how governments, as strategic actors, see their role in the DT and how they frame these documents. In this paper, we argue that policymaking about DT is isomorphic in the global context, rather than a differentiator for countries to gain a competitive edge. Using machine learning to analyze a vast text corpus of policy documents, we identify the common repertoire of narratives used by governments from all around the globe to picture their vision of the DT and show that DT policies appear to be almost context-free due to their high similarity.

This paper first traces the long historical arm of rational choice thinking in the West to Judeo-Christian thinking, Calvin and Weber. It then presents a case study that illustrates the consequences of the ethic of rational choice and individual responsibility. It subsequently examines and contextualizes Rasmussen's legacy of pushing back against the long historical arm of rational choice, showing that bad outcomes are not the result of human immoral choice, but the product of normal interactions between people and systems. If we don't understand why people did what they did, Rasmussen suggested, it is not because people behaved inexplicably, but because we took the wrong perspective.

We compared the generated scenarios between scanning method experts and non-experts with no prior experience with the scanning method. We found that experts generated more unique scenarios than non-experts did, and that experts and non-experts differed in the diversity of articles referenced when generating scenarios. We discuss the relationship between the present findings and previous findings on divergent thinking.

AB  - It is underlined that typical nanosystems are adequately described only by the fundamental laws of theoretical physics. It is in particular argued that phenomenological models are in most cases not sophisticated enough. For the description of such nanosystems the theoretical and computational tools have to be selected carefully and have in particular to be improved in many cases. In this connection the interaction laws (potentials) between the atoms, forming a nanosystem, are critical functions because the structure and dynamics of such systems are very sensitive to small variations in the potentials. This point has been studied in detail. Various potential laws have been introduced and discussed in connection with applications. The most relevant simulations methods are quoted and their relevance for nanotechnology is discussed. In particular, the molecular dynamics method is described in detail. We give typical examples, which demonstrate the fact the molecular dynamics method is a powerful and reliable tool for the investigation of typical nanosystems with their large variety of structures and complex dynamical states. The examples deal with wear at the nanotechnological level and with metallic nanoclusters as building blocks.

AB  - Business processes are a key driver of organizational success, which is why business process improvement (BPI) is a central activity of business process management. Despite an abundance of approaches, BPI as a creative task is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Most importantly, its level of computational support is low. The few computational BPI approaches hardly leverage the opportunities brought about by computational creativity, neglect process data, and rely on rather rigid improvement patterns. Given the increasing amount of process data in the form of event logs and the uptake of generative machine learning for automating creative tasks in various domains, there is huge potential for BPI. Hence, following the design science research paradigm, we specified, implemented, and evaluated ProcessGAN, a novel computational BPI approach based on generative adversarial networks that supports the creation of BPI ideas. Our evaluation shows that ProcessGAN improves the creativity of process designers, particularly the originality of BPI ideas, and shapes up useful in real-world settings. Moreover, ProcessGAN is the first approach to combine BPI and computational creativity.

AB  - I discuss a multi-level analysis approach in the study of cognitive development in cultural context. In this approach, culture is conceived of as a system and a process of symbolic mediation, where values, norms, and beliefs manifest in and through customs, rituals, and practices in directing and regulating both intrapersonal and interpersonal psychological functions. To capture the dynamic process in which cognitive development unfolds in cultural context, this approach examines the influence of culture on the developing cognitive skills between groups – group level analysis, between the child and socialization agents – dyadic level analysis, at the level of the child – individual level analysis, and within the child – situation level analysis. The temporal level analysis further situates cognitive development in historical time. By utilizing different analytical and methodological strategies, the multi-level analysis approach provides converging evidence for the development of cognitive skills in cultural context. Important challenges in this approach include the development of a “big picture” to guide the investigation, methodological training for research assistants, and difficulties in collecting, managing, and analyzing diverse datasets. I discuss the conceptual and methodological issues by using our work on the development of episodic thinking as an example.

AB  - 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has become an important and powerful tool for the quantitative analysis of metabolic networks in the framework of metabolic engineering. Isotopically instationary 13C MFA under metabolic stationary conditions is a promising refinement of classical stationary MFA. It accounts for the experimental requirements of non-steady-state cultures as well as for the shortening of the experimental duration. This contribution extends all computational methods developed for classical stationary 13C MFA to the instationary situation by using high-performance computing methods. The developed tools allow for the simulation of instationary carbon labeling experiments (CLEs), sensitivity calculation with respect to unknown parameters, fitting of the model to the measured data, statistical identifiability analysis and an optimal experimental design facility. To explore the potential of the new approach all these tools are applied to the central metabolism of Escherichia coli. The achieved results are compared to the outcome of the stationary counterpart, especially focusing on statistical properties. This demonstrates the specific strengths of the instationary method. A new ranking method is proposed making both an a priori and an a posteriori design of the sampling times available. It will be shown that although still not all fluxes are identifiable, the quality of flux estimates can be strongly improved in the instationary case. Moreover, statements about the size of some immeasurable pool sizes can be made.

AB  - Abstract The methodological characteristics of the chronotopologic data analysis chain are discussed. Various kinds of knowledge are considered and properly classified, and several illustrative examples in applied sciences are presented. Big data and data-driven analyses are critically reviewed, and their implementation carefully assessed. Data scale types are classifications considered in property- and attribute-oriented settings. Classical statistics inadequacies are pointed out and the need of a chronotopology-dependent statistics is outlined. The chronotopologic visualization thinking mode and techniques are briefly reviewed.

AB  - Landscape approaches are integrated place-based approaches and provide cross-sectoral opportunities to facilitate sustainability transformations. The COVID-19 outbreak has profound ramifications for multiple dimensions of landscapes, ranging from mobility and lifestyle to value to environment and society. Therefore, integrated approaches to “health” have been more vigorously promoted in the policy arena dealing with human–nature interactions. The ecosystem principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which resonate with landscape approaches, are generally aligned with integrated approaches to health. However, commonalities and distinctions between these integrated approaches in both political and scientific domains have not been clarified. Drawing on a narrative review of the literature on “One Health,” “Ecohealth,” and “Planetary Health” as major health-oriented approaches in comparison with landscape approaches, the aspects of landscape approaches to be complemented in addressing health-related challenges were examined in this study. In addition to the review on the intellectual roots and evolutionary pathways, a comparative analysis of these relevant approaches was conducted in terms of three realms including theoretical assumptions, knowledge bases, and research paradigms. The results of the comparative review show that all approaches share systems thinking, interdisciplinarity, cross-sectoral collaboration, and holistic paradigm but differ with respect to their focused management problems, disciplines, and sectors as well as ontological and epistemological underpinnings. Pointing to the recent theoretical and methodological development in integrating health in placemaking, the results of this study suggest that pragmatic landscape approaches could be strengthened by using health-related research paradigms to achieve better constructivism–positivism meeting grounds regarding health–landscape intersections.

AB  - The work presents two new numerical techniques devised for modeling propagating material failure, i.e. cracks in fracture mechanics or slip-lines in soil mechanics. The first one is termed crack-path-field technique and is conceived for the identification of the path of those cracks, or slip-lines, represented by strain-localization based solutions of the material failure problem. The second one is termed strain-injection, and consists of a procedure to insert, during specific stages of the simulation and in selected areas of the domain of analysis, goal oriented specific strain fields via mixed finite element formulations. In the approach, a first injection, of elemental constant strain modes (CSM) in quadrilaterals, is used, in combination of the crack-path-field technique, for obtaining reliable information that anticipates the position of the crack-path. Based on this information, in a subsequent stage, a discontinuous displacement mode (DDM) is efficiently injected, ensuring the required continuity of the crack-path across sides of contiguous elements. Combination of both techniques results in an efficient and robust procedure based on the staggered resolution of the crack-path-field and the mechanical failure problems. It provides the classical advantages of the “intra-elemental” methods for capturing complex propagating displacement discontinuities in coarse meshes, as E-FEM or X-FEM methods, with the non-code-invasive character of the crack-path-field technique. Numerical representative simulations of a wide range of benchmarks, in terms of the type of material and the failure problem, show the broad applicability, accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology. The finite element code used for the simulations is open-source and available at http://www.cimne.com/compdesmat/.

AB  - Applied artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, in biomedical research is accelerating, but effective discovery and validation requires a toolset without limitations or bias. On January 30, 2023, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) appointed an ad hoc committee to identify the needs and opportunities to advance the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations of digital twins in applications across science, medicine, engineering, and society. On December 15, 2023, the NAS released a 164-page report, “Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins.” This report described the importance of using digital twins in biomedical research. The current study was designed to develop an innovative method that incorporated phenotype-ranking algorithms with knowledge engineering via a biomimetic digital twin ecosystem. This ecosystem applied real-world reasoning principles to nonnormalized, raw data to identify hidden or "dark" data. Clinical exome sequencing study on patients with endometriosis indicated four variants of unknown clinical significance potentially associated with endometriosis-related disorders in nearly all patients analyzed. One variant of unknown clinical significance was identified in all patient samples and could be a biomarker for diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the recommendations of the NAS to biomedical research. This method can be used to understand the mechanisms of any disease, for virtual clinical trials, and to identify effective new therapies.

AB  - Anhedonia, a lack of pleasure in things an individual once enjoyed, and rumination, the process of perseverative and repetitive attention to specific thoughts, are hallmark features of depression. Though these both contribute to the same debilitating disorder, they have often been studied independently and through different theoretical lenses (e.g., biological vs. cognitive). Cognitive theories and research on rumination have largely focused on understanding negative affect in depression with much less focus on the etiology and maintenance of anhedonia. In this paper, we argue that by examining the relation between cognitive constructs and deficits in positive affect, we may better understand anhedonia in depression thereby improving prevention and intervention efforts. We review the extant literature on cognitive deficits in depression and discuss how these dysfunctions may not only lead to sustained negative affect but, importantly, interfere with an ability to attend to social and environmental cues that could restore positive affect. Specifically, we discuss how rumination is associated to deficits in working memory and propose that these deficits in working memory may contribute to anhedonia in depression. We further argue that analytical approaches such as computational modeling are needed to study these questions and, finally, discuss implications for treatment.

AB  - Toxicology in the 21st Century has seen a shift from chemical risk assessment based on traditional animal tests, identifying apical endpoints and doses that are “safe”, to the prospect of Next Generation Risk Assessment based on non-animal methods. Increasingly, large and high throughput in vitro datasets are being generated and exploited to develop computational models. This is accompanied by an increased use of machine learning approaches in the model building process. A potential problem, however, is that such models, while robust and predictive, may still lack credibility from the perspective of the end-user. In this commentary, we argue that the science of causal inference and reasoning, as proposed by Judea Pearl, will facilitate the development, use and acceptance of quantitative AOP models. Our hope is that by importing established concepts of causality from outside the field of toxicology, we can be “constructively disruptive” to the current toxicological paradigm, using the “Causal Revolution” to bring about a “Toxicological Revolution” more rapidly.

AB  - Organizations are transforming as they adopt new technologies and use new sources of data, changing the experiences of employees and pushing organizational researchers to respond. As employees perform their daily activities, they generate vast digital data. These data, when combined with established methods and new analytic techniques, create unprecedented opportunities for studying human behavior at work and have fueled the rise of people analytics as a new institutional field of practice. In this chapter, I describe the emerging field of people analytics and new organizational phenomena that accompany the use of data and algorithms. These practices are affecting how individuals, groups, and organizations function, ranging from decision-making processes and work procedures, to communication and collaboration, to attempts to monitor and control employees. In each of these domains, I describe recent research and propose new research directions. Many of these domains intersect with the emerging field of Computational Social Science, in which disciplinary scholars are applying computational methods to an expanding array of digitized data, pursuing interests that extend far into the organizational domain. Organizational scholars are well-positioned to bridge organizational and disciplinary advances to stay at the forefront of research on the future of work.

AB  - Established as a sub-discipline of Chemical Engineering in the 1960s by the late Professor R.W.H. Sargent at Imperial College London, Process Systems Engineering (PSE) has played a significant role in advancing the field, positioning it as a leading engineering discipline in the contemporary technological landscape. Rooted in Applied Mathematics and Computing, PSE aligns with the key components driving advancements in our modern, information-centric era. Sargent’s visionary foresight anticipated the evolution of early computational tools into fundamental elements for future technological and scientific breakthroughs, all while maintaining a central focus on Chemical Engineering. This paper aims to present concise and concrete ideas for propelling PSE into a new era of progress. The objective is twofold: to preserve PSE’s extensive and diverse knowledge base and to reposition it more prominently within modern Chemical Engineering, while also establishing robust connections with other data-driven engineering and applied science domains that play important roles in industrial and technological advancements. Rather than merely reacting to contemporary challenges, this article seeks to proactively create opportunities to lead the future of Chemical Engineering across its vital contributions in education, research, technology transfer, and business creation, fully leveraging its inherent multidisciplinarity and versatile character.

AB  - Most research into causal learning has focused on atemporal contingency data settings while fewer studies have examined learning and reasoning about systems exhibiting events that unfold in continuous time. Of these, none have yet explored learning about preventative causal influences. How do people use temporal information to infer which components of a causal system are generating or preventing activity of other components? In what ways do generative and preventative causes interact in shaping the behavior of causal mechanisms and their learnability? We explore human causal structure learning within a space of hypotheses that combine generative and preventative causal relationships. Participants observe the behavior of causal devices as they are perturbed by fixed interventions and subject to either regular or irregular spontaneous activations. We find that participants are capable learners in this setting, successfully identifying the large majority of generative, preventative and non-causal relationships but making certain attribution errors. We lay out a computational-level framework for normative inference in this setting and propose a family of more cognitively plausible algorithmic approximations. We find that participants’ judgment patterns can be both qualitatively and quantitatively captured by a model that approximates normative inference via a simulation and summary statistics scheme based on structurally local computation using temporally local evidence.

AB  - The basic motivation behind this work is to tie together various computational complexity classes, whether over different domains such as the naturals or the reals, or whether defined in different manners, via function algebras (Real Recursive Functions) or via Turing Machines (Computable Analysis). We provide general tools for investigating these issues, using a technique we call the method of approximation. We give the general development of this method, and apply it to obtain 2 theorems. First we connect the discrete operation of linear recursion (basically equivalent to the combination of bounded sums and bounded products) to linear differential equations, thus providing an alternative proof of the result from Campagnolo, Moore and Costa [M.L. Campagnolo, C. Moore and J. F. Costa, An analog characterization of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, Journal of Complexity 18 (2002) 977–100]. Secondly, we extend this to prove a result similar to that of Bournez and Hainry [O. Bournez and E. Hainry, Elementarily computable functions over the real numbers and R-sub-recursive functions, Theoretical Computer Science 348 (2005) 130–147], providing a function algebra for the real functions computable in elementary time. Their proof involves simulating the operation of a Turing Machine using a function algebra. We avoid this simulation, using a technique we call “lifting,” which allows us to lift the classic result regarding the Kalmar elementary computable functions to a result on the reals. While we do not claim that our result is necessarily an improvement (perhaps just different), we do want to make the point that our two techniques appear readily applicable to other problems of this sort.

AB  - Thought disorder, as inferred from disorganized and incoherent speech, is an important part of the clinical presentation in schizophrenia. Traditional measurement approaches essentially count occurrences of certain speech events which may have restricted their usefulness. Applying speech technologies in assessment can help automate traditional clinical rating tasks and thereby complement the process. Adopting these computational approaches affords clinical translational opportunities to enhance the traditional assessment by applying such methods remotely and scoring various parts of the assessment automatically. Further, digital measures of language may help detect subtle clinically significant signs and thus potentially disrupt the usual manner by which things are conducted. If proven beneficial to patient care, methods where patients’ voice are the primary data source could become core components of future clinical decision support systems that improve risk assessment. However, even if it is possible to measure thought disorder in a sensitive, reliable and efficient manner, there remain many challenges to then translate into a clinically implementable tool that can contribute towards providing better care. Indeed, embracing technology - notably artificial intelligence - requires vigorous standards for reporting underlying assumptions so as to ensure a trustworthy and ethical clinical science.

We identify opportunities for providing reminders to operators in their environment as a means to address information overload. Hence, there is a need to represent a state of knowledge and help them stay vigilant during their jobs. Along with the architectural improvements, which further specialize information flows and develop a data-driven approach, continual learning techniques covered events in a probabilistic graphical model called Context-Dependent Recommendation Systems (CD-RS). We demonstrated, as a result, the use of statistical thinking and Design of Experiments (DoE), which are most clear in conducting a suitable experiment. Moreover, the validation of the model and experiments of the novel architecture based on the collected data from a real case study demonstrates the value of the proposed methods.

AB  - The analysis of many physical and engineering problems involves running complex computational models (simulation models, computer codes). With problems of this type, it is important to understand the relationships between the input variables (whose values are often imprecisely known) and the output. The goal of sensitivity analysis (SA) is to study this relationship and identify the most significant factors or variables affecting the results of the model. In this presentation, an improvement on existing methods for SA of complex computer models is described for use when the model is too computationally expensive for a standard Monte-Carlo analysis. In these situations, a meta-model or surrogate model can be used to estimate the necessary sensitivity index for each input. A sensitivity index is a measure of the variance in the response that is due to the uncertainty in an input. Most existing approaches to this problem either do not work well with a large number of input variables and/or they ignore the error involved in estimating a sensitivity index. Here, a new approach to sensitivity index estimation using meta-models and bootstrap confidence intervals is described that provides solutions to these drawbacks. Further, an efficient yet effective approach to incorporate this methodology into an actual SA is presented. Several simulated and real examples illustrate the utility of this approach. This framework can be extended to uncertainty analysis as well.

AB  - Critical for transcription initiation and bulky lesion DNA repair, TFIIH provides an exemplary system to connect molecular mechanisms to biological outcomes due to its strong genetic links to different specific human diseases. Recent advances in structural and computational biology provide a unique opportunity to re-examine biologically relevant molecular structures and develop possible mechanistic insights for the large dynamic TFIIH complex. TFIIH presents many puzzles involving how its two SF2 helicase family enzymes, XPB and XPD, function in transcription initiation and repair: how do they initiate transcription, detect and verify DNA damage, select the damaged strand for incision, coordinate repair with transcription and cell cycle through Cdk-activating-kinase (CAK) signaling, and result in very different specific human diseases associated with cancer, aging, and development from single missense mutations? By joining analyses of breakthrough cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and advanced computation with data from biochemistry and human genetics, we develop unified concepts and molecular level understanding for TFIIH functions with a focus on structural mechanisms. We provocatively consider that TFIIH may have first evolved from evolutionary pressure for TCR to resolve arrested transcription blocks to DNA replication and later added its key roles in transcription initiation and global DNA repair. We anticipate that this level of mechanistic information will have significant impact on thinking about TFIIH, laying a robust foundation suitable to develop new paradigms for DNA transcription initiation and repair along with insights into disease prevention, susceptibility, diagnosis and interventions.

AB  - Neurocognitive research is pertinent to developing mechanistic models of how humans generate creative thoughts. Such models usually overlook the role of the motor cortex in creative thinking. The framework of embodied or grounded cognition suggests that creative thoughts (e.g. using a shoe as a hammer, improvising a piano solo) are partially served by simulations of motor activity associated with tools and their use. The major hypothesis stemming from the embodied or grounded account is that, while the motor system is used to execute actions, simulations within this system also support higher-order cognition, creativity included. That is, the cognitive process of generating creative output, not just executing it, is deeply embedded in motor processes. Here, we highlight a collection of neuroimaging research that implicates the motor system in generating creative thoughts, including some evidence for its functionally necessary role in generating creative output. Specifically, the grounded or embodied framework suggests that generating creative output may, in part, rely on motor simulations of possible actions, and that these simulations may by partially implemented in the motor regions themselves. In such cases, action simulations (i.e. reactivating or re-using the motor system), do not result in overt action but instead are used to support higher-order cognitive goals like generating creative uses or improvising.

AB  - Biomarkers remain the highest value proposition in cancer medicine today—especially protein biomarkers. Despite decades of evolving regulatory frameworks to facilitate the review of emerging technologies, biomarkers have been mostly about promise with very little to show for improvements in human health. Cancer is an emergent property of a complex system, and deconvoluting the integrative and dynamic nature of the overall system through biomarkers is a daunting proposition. The last 2 decades have seen an explosion of multiomics profiling and a range of advanced technologies for precision medicine, including the emergence of liquid biopsy, exciting advances in single-cell analysis, artificial intelligence (machine and deep learning) for data analysis, and many other advanced technologies that promise to transform biomarker discovery. Combining multiple omics modalities to acquire a more comprehensive landscape of the disease state, we are increasingly developing biomarkers to support therapy selection and patient monitoring. Furthering precision medicine, especially in oncology, necessitates moving away from the lens of reductionist thinking toward viewing and understanding that complex diseases are, in fact, complex adaptive systems. As such, we believe it is necessary to redefine biomarkers as representations of biological system states at different hierarchical levels of biological order. This definition could include traditional molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiological characteristics, as well as emerging classes of digital markers and complex algorithms. To succeed in the future, we must move past purely observational individual studies and instead start building a mechanistic framework to enable integrative analysis of new studies within the context of prior studies. Identifying information in complex systems and applying theoretical constructs, such as information theory, to study cancer as a disease of dysregulated communication could prove to be “game changing” for the clinical outcome of cancer patients.

The prototype heuristic theory has proved that the individual epiphany ability depends on the individual's ability to get out of the fetter of mental fixation, activate the prototype and acquire the key heuristic information from the activated prototype. Based on this theory, this present research combines the findings of extenics, TRIZ and theory of creativity to have developed a systematic method on enhancing individual epiphany ability. Supported by information technology, the method takes theory of creativity as its methodology, extension strategy generation as its framework, element theory its database and knowledge management its feedback chain. The research aims to cultivate creative thinking and eventually enhance the creativity of individuals.

AB  - Titanium-based semiconductors are wildly recognized as one of the most commonly used photocatalysts for photocatalysis. Energy band modulation is a key aspect of the catalytic activity of photocatalytic semiconductors, but the acquisition of semiconductor energy bands is still a complex and important task. In recent years, machine learning has played an important role in materials prediction, where the crystal structure of a material is usually used as input in energy band prediction. However, existing machine learning algorithms cannot accurately predict the energy bands of materials from structural components. Here, we convert the chemical formula into component descriptors after comparing first principles and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis) errors on bandgap values, and the component and bandgap values form a set of labeled data pairs. The chemical formula components are used as input to accurately predict the energy bands of the material. In our evaluation, the model outperforms existing machine learning methods in predicting energy bands, yielding mean absolute value errors of about 0.277 eV, and possesses a significant advantage in component prediction. In particular, this method of predicting the photocatalytic semiconductor energy band gap from chemical formula components provides a new way of thinking about photocatalyst selectivity.

AB  - Is the brain at rest during the so-called resting state? Ongoing experiences in the resting state vary in unobserved and uncontrolled ways across time, individuals, and populations. However, the role of self-generated thoughts in resting-state fMRI remains largely unexplored. In this study, we collected real-time self-generated thoughts during “resting-state” fMRI scans via the think-aloud method (i.e., think-aloud fMRI), which required participants to report whatever they were currently thinking. We first investigated brain activation patterns during a think-aloud condition and found that significantly activated brain areas included all brain regions required for speech. We then calculated the relationship between divergence in thought content and brain activation during think-aloud and found that divergence in thought content was associated with many brain regions. Finally, we explored the neural representation of self-generated thoughts by performing representational similarity analysis (RSA) at three neural scales: a voxel-wise whole-brain searchlight level, a region-level whole-brain analysis using the Schaefer 400-parcels, and at the systems level using the Yeo seven-networks. We found that “resting-state” self-generated thoughts were distributed across a wide range of brain regions involving all seven Yeo networks. This study highlights the value of considering ongoing experiences during resting-state fMRI and providing preliminary methodological support for think-aloud fMRI.

KW  - Particle–fluid interaction

AB  - The present work develops a flexible and robust solution strategy to resolve coupled systems comprised of large numbers of flowing particles embedded within a fluid. A model problem, consisting of particles which may undergo inelastic collisions in the presence of near-field forces, is considered. The particles are surrounded by a continuous interstitial fluid which is assumed to obey the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. Thermal effects are also considered. Such particle/fluid systems are strongly coupled, due to the mechanical forces and heat transfer induced by the fluid onto the particles and vice-versa. Because the coupling of the various particle and fluid fields can dramatically change over the course of a flow process, a primary focus of this work is the development of a recursive “staggering” solution scheme, whereby the time-steps are adaptively adjusted to control the error associated with the incomplete resolution of the coupled interaction between the various solid particulate and continuum fluid fields. A central feature of the approach is the ability to account for the presence of particles within the fluid in a straightforward manner that can be easily incorporated within any standard computational fluid mechanics code based on finite difference, finite element or finite volume type discretization. A three dimensional example is provided to illustrate the overall approach.

AB  - This paper discusses an uncertain two-machine permutation flow-shop scheduling problem (2PFSP) with total weighted tardiness and common due date. Uncertain processing times are described by a large set of discrete scenarios, which is a type of big data. The objective is to minimize the schedule performance under the worst-case scenario. Identifying the worst-case scenario for each evaluated schedule is quite time-consuming in the situation that the scenario set size is large so that the objective evaluation might be computationally expensive. To handle this difficulty, three-way decision is used to preprocess the large-size scenario set to get a reduced scenario set so that the concept of surrogate worst-case scenario is adopted. A hybrid harmony search algorithm of combining three-island framework and the scenario-based local search is developed to solve the discussed problem. Based on the single-scenario knowledge of 2PFSP, a problem-specific scenario-dependent neighborhood structure is constructed under the surrogate worst-case scenario. An extensive experiment was carried out. The computational results show that the application of surrogate worst-case scenario based on three-way decision is effective in reducing the time consuming while keeping schedule performance evaluation. Being compared to the worst-case scenario objective evaluation, for an example in the case of the middle bad-scenario ratio, the surrogate worst-case scenario objective evaluation made the solution algorithm save 12.95 % in average CPU time for all instances while the relative performance difference is only 1.809 % in average. Being compared to possible alternative algorithms derived from the state-of-the-art algorithms, the developed algorithm is advantageous for the addressed problems.

AB  - The present qualitative case study on mathematics majors’ visualization of eigenvector–eigenvalue concepts in a dynamic environment highlights the significance of student-generated representations in a theoretical framework drawn from Sierpinska's (2000) modes of thinking in linear algebra. Such an approach seemed to provide the research participants with mathematical freedom, which resulted in an awareness of the multiple ways that eigenvalue–eigenvector relationships could be visualized in a manner that widened students’ repertoire of meta-representational competences (diSessa, 2004) in coordination with their preferred modes of visualization. Students’ expression of visual fluency in the course of making sense of the eigenvalue problem Au=λu associated with a variety of matrices occurred in different, yet not necessarily hierarchical modes of visualizations that differed from matrix to matrix: (i) synthetic/analytic mode manifested in the process of detecting eigenvectors when the sought eigenvector and the matrix-applied product vector were aligned in the same/opposite directions; (ii) analytic arithmetic mode manifested in the case of singular matrices (in the determination of the zero eigenvalue) and invertible matrices with nonreal eigenvalues; (iii) analytic structural mode, though rarely occurred, manifested in making sense of the trajectory (circle, ellipse, line segment) of the matrix-applied product vector and relating trajectory behavior to matrix type. While the connection between the thinking modes (Sierpinska, 2000) and the concreteness–necessity–generalizability triad (Harel, 2000) was not sharp, math majors still frequently implemented the CNG principles, which proved facilitatory tools in the evolution of students’ thinking about the eigenvalue–eigenvector relationships.

Systems mapping methods and applications for PA are emerging in the scientific literature in the study of complex health issues and can be used as a prelude to mathematical/computational modeling where important factors and relationships can be elucidated, data needs can be prioritized and guided, interventions can be tested and (co)designed, and metrics and evaluations can be developed. Examples are discussed that describe systems mapping based on Group Model Building or literature reviews. Systems maps are highly informative, illustrate multiple components to address PA and physical inactivity issues, and make compelling arguments against single intervention action. No studies were identified in the literature scan that considered cardiorespiratory fitness the focal point of a systems maps. Recommendations for future research and education are presented and it is concluded that systems mapping represents a valuable yet underutilized tool for visualizing the complexity of PA promotion.

AB  - ABSTRACT
This review covers literature between 2003–2021 The development and application of genome mining tools has given rise to ever-growing genetic and chemical databases and propelled natural products research into the modern age of Big Data. Likewise, an explosion of evolutionary studies has unveiled genetic patterns of natural products biosynthesis and function that support Darwin's theory of natural selection and other theories of adaptation and diversification. In this review, we aim to highlight how Big Data and evolutionary thinking converge in the study of natural products, and how this has led to an emerging sub-discipline of evolutionary genome mining of natural products. First, we outline general principles to best utilize Big Data in natural products research, addressing key considerations needed to provide evolutionary context. We then highlight successful examples where Big Data and evolutionary analyses have been combined to provide bioinformatic resources and tools for the discovery of novel natural products and their biosynthetic enzymes. Rather than an exhaustive list of evolution-driven discoveries, we highlight examples where Big Data and evolutionary thinking have been embraced for the evolutionary genome mining of natural products. After reviewing the nascent history of this sub-discipline, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of genomic and metabolomic tools with evolutionary foundations and/or implications and provide a future outlook for this emerging and exciting field of natural product research.

AB  - Is consciousness based in prefrontal circuits involved in cognitive processes like thought, reasoning, and memory or is it based in sensory areas in the back of the neocortex? The no-report paradigm has been crucial to this debate because it aims to separate the neural basis of the cognitive processes underlying post-perceptual decision and report from the neural basis of conscious perception itself. However, the no-report paradigm is problematic because, even in the absence of report, subjects might engage in post-perceptual cognitive processing. Therefore, to isolate the neural basis of consciousness, a no-cognition paradigm is needed. Here, I describe a no-cognition approach to binocular rivalry and outline how this approach can help to resolve debates about the neural basis of consciousness.

AB  - Thermal energy storage (TES) is one of the key technologies for enabling a higher deployment of renewable energy. In this context, the present study analyzes the modeling strategies of one of the most common TES systems: stratified thermal storage tanks. These systems are essential to many solar thermal installations and heat pumps, among other clean energy technologies. Three different one-dimensional tank models are compared by their computing speed and resilience to long time steps. Two of the models analyzed are numerical, one being explicit and the other one implicit, and the other is analytical. The models are validated against data from experiments carried out considering small-scale stratified tanks, showing that their performance can be improved by using the Advanced Flowrate Distribution (AFD) method. The results show that the analytical model maintains its accuracy with longer time steps and is robust against divergence. Conversely, the numerical models show equivalent performance for short time steps, while the computation time is reduced. Although the AFD method shows promising results by achieving an improvement of 43% in terms of Dynamic Time Warping, its parameter optimization must be generalized for different tank designs, flow rates, and temperatures.

AB  - Abstract:
This chapter reviews the latest researches and advances in the uses of the computational modeling and ab initio calculations on the study of the MAX phases and their properties. The fundamentals and approaches of the density functional theory in the ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and the importance of the theory in the study of the MAX phases are introduced. The studies of the electronic structures and properties, in particular, the energy band structures and total and/or partial density of states of the MAX phases, by using the means of the density function theory are illustrated and discussed. The stability and occurrence of the MAX phases predicted and confirmed by the density functional theory based energetic calculations are addressed. The ab initio calculated elastic and other physical properties of the MAX phases, and the effects of pressure, defects and impurities on the various structural and physical properties are also discussed.

AB  - Groundwater models are essential for understanding aquifer systems behavior and effective water resources spatio-temporal distributions, yet they are often hindered by challenges related to model assumptions, parametrization, uncertainty, and computational efficiency. Machine intelligence, especially deep learning, promises a paradigm shift in overcoming these challenges. A critical examination of existing machine-driven methods reveals the inherent limitations, particularly in terms of the interpretability and the ability to generalize findings. To overcome these challenges, we develop a ternary framework that synergizes the valuable insights from multisource data, human expertise, and machine intelligence. This framework capitalizes on the distinct strengths of each element: the value and relevance of multisource data, the innovative capacity of human expertise, and the analytical efficiency of machine intelligence. Our goal is to conceptualize sustainable water management practices and enhance our understanding and predictive capabilities of groundwater systems. Unlike approaches that rely solely on abundant data, our framework emphasizes the quality and strategic use of available data, combined with human intellect and advanced computing, to overcome current limitations and pave the way for more realistic groundwater simulations.
