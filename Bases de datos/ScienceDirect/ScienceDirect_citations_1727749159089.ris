AB  - Does positive thinking predict variance in school grades over and above that predicted by cognitive ability? Six hundred and thirty nine high school students participated in a three-year longitudinal study that predicted grades using cognitive ability and three positive thinking variables – self-esteem, hope, and attributional style. Hope, positive attributional style and cognitive ability predicted higher grades, whilst self-esteem was a less consistent predictor of academic performance. Structural equation modelling revealed significant paths from cognitive ability, gender, and a second order positive thinking factor to grades. The results suggest that intelligence, gender, and positive thinking each play a unique role in predicting academic performance in youth. Some suggestions for further research are made.

AB  - Food systems and our ability to secure food and nutrition for current and future generations is challenged by population growth, climate change, resource depletion and pollution. The current agricultural and supply chain systems are one of the main contributors to the issues. Transformational, not incremental change is needed to transition to sustainable food systems capable of feeding close to 10 billion people in less than 30 years. Artificial intelligence (AI) is pervading all parts of food systems in ways that indicate transformative system changes are possible. Designers, as mediators between people, technology and the environment have a responsibility to recognise and reflect on ways AI could bring the change needed to move to sustainable food systems. This literature review is situated at the intersection of Food systems, Design, Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability. The transdisciplinary approach reveals what exists across the disciplines, what can be done with AI to transition to sustainable food systems, how Design proposes to approach the change, and which ethical or philosophical considerations start to emerge. The discussion reflects on AI as a potential leverage point to bring changes in the system and on the designer's role in establishing the human-technology-environmental relationships. Further research and recommendations are provided.

AB  - The era of Big Data has arrived along with large volume, complex and growing data generated by many distinct sources. Nowadays, nearly every aspect of the modern society is impacted by Big Data, involving medical, health care, business, management and government. It has been receiving growing attention of researches from many disciplines including natural sciences, life sciences, engineering and even art & humanities. It also leads to new research paradigms and ways of thinking on the path of development. Lots of developed and under-developing tools improve our ability to make more felicitous decisions than what we have made ever before. This paper presents an overview on Big Data including four issues, namely: (i) concepts, characteristics and processing paradigms of Big Data; (ii) the state-of-the-art techniques for decision making in Big Data; (iii) felicitous decision making applications of Big Data in social science; and (iv) the current challenges of Big Data as well as possible future directions.

AB  - On all sandy coastlines fringed by dunes, understanding localised air flow allows us to examine the potential sand transfer between the beach and dunes by wind-blown (Aeolian) action. Traditional thinking into this phenomenon had previously included only onshore winds as effective drivers of this transfer. Recent research by the authors, however, has shown that offshore air-flow too can contribute significantly, through lee-side back eddies, to the overall windblown sediment budget to coastal dunes. Under rising sea levels and increased erosion scenarios, this is an important process in any post-storm recovery of sandy beaches. Until now though, full visualisation in 3D of this newly recognised mechanism in offshore flows has not been achieved. Here, we show for the first time, this return flow eddy system using 3D computational fluid dynamics modelling, and reveal the presence of complex corkscrew vortices and other phenomena. The work highlights the importance of relatively small surface undulations in the dune crest which act to induce the spatial patterns of airflow (and transport) found on the adjacent beach.

AB  - Theoretical proposals suggest that emotional intelligence (EI) may favor creativity. In the present paper, two studies are reported with French adults to examine the degree to which the ability to identify emotion is related to creative performance. This component of ability EI was hypothesized to be positively associated with a divergent thinking task involving emotional information. Contrary to our expectations, the first study (n=95) indicated that ability to identify emotions in faces and images was negatively related to idea generation ability. The second study (n=100) including a measure of alexithymia confirmed this relation. Moreover, evaluating emotional creativity, we observed a significant negative link between the ability to identify emotions and the tendency to experience emotions differently from those of others. We discuss these results suggesting an opposition between consensual/convergent thinking concerning emotions (ability EI) and divergent thinking.

AB  - The production of biofuels is inextricably linked with the water-energy-food-land (WEFL) nexus. Understanding these linkages is necessary to formulate effective policies that can influence positive outcomes and contribute to the realization of long-term economic, environmental, and social goals. The use of biofuels can help achieve the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, the biofuels sector must account for its interdependencies and trade-offs with other sectors. In this study, we formulate a qualitative analytical model that goes beyond the three water-energy-food nexus components by incorporating other elements, such as policy, innovation, governance, and labor to examine their effect as influencing factors and to understand how synergies, trade-offs, and long-overlooked interlinkages between sectors and among existing policies and institutions can become visible. This qualitative model was applied to the case of ethanol in Brazil, for which a large corpus was constructed from the scientific literature, documents and sustainability reports from sugarcane ethanol companies. We used a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) algorithm along with co-occurrence and network analyses. The results demonstrate this approach can be used to evaluate the interfaces between science, policy, and businesses within the WEFL-biofuels nexus. This is done by identifying how best to integrate the development of policies, governance, and stakeholder actions to support cost-effective decisions for optimal resource management and regulatory processes while enabling better integration of scientific insight and policy-making. We also identified how these four influencing factors are of vital importance within the nexus and, if properly addressed, can contribute to more holistic nexus thinking management.

KW  - Compact manifolds
AB  - Moving mesh methods were devised to redistribute a mesh in a smooth way, while keeping the number of vertices of the mesh and their connectivity unchanged. A fruitful theoretical point-of-view is to take such moving mesh methods and think of them as an application of the diffeomorphic density matching problem. Given two probability measures μ0 and μ1, the diffeomorphic density matching problem consists of finding a diffeomorphic pushforward map T such that T#μ0=μ1. Moving mesh methods are seen to be an instance of the diffeomorphic density matching problem by treating the probability density as the local density of nodes in the mesh. It is preferable that the restructuring of the mesh be done in a smooth way that avoids tangling the connections between nodes, which would lead to numerical instability when the mesh is used in computational applications. This then suggests that a diffeomorphic map T is desirable to avoid tangling. The first tool employed to solve the moving mesh problem between source and target probability densities on the sphere was Optimal Transport (OT). Recently Optimal Information Transport (OIT) was rigorously derived and developed allowing for the computation of a diffeomorphic mapping by simply solving a Poisson equation. Not only is the equation simpler to solve numerically in OIT, but with Optimal Transport there is no guarantee that the mapping between probability density functions defines a diffeomorphism for general 2D compact manifolds. In this manuscript, we perform a side-by-side comparison of using Optimal Transport and Optimal Information Transport on the sphere for adaptive mesh problems. We choose to perform this comparison with recently developed provably convergent solvers, but these are, of course, not the only numerical methods that may be used. We believe that Optimal Information Transport is preferable in computations due to the fact that the partial differential equation (PDE) solve step is simply a Poisson equation. For more general surfaces M, we show how the Optimal Transport and Optimal Information Transport problems can be reduced to solving on the sphere, provided that there exists a diffeomorphic mapping Φ:M→S2. This implies that the Optimal Transport problem on M with a special cost function can be solved with regularity guarantees, while computations for the problem are performed on the unit sphere.

AB  - Introduction
Modern computers often use programs that incorporate a programming technique called Object Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing users to manipulate complex ‘computational objects’ such as menus, screen windows, etc with very little effort, say the click of a mouse. OOP deals with structures called objects and allows time and computational effort saving devices such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation. We examine whether the brain itself may use OOP and if representation of objects suffers a breakdown in schizophrenia.
Review of literature
Previous models fail to provide a unifying explanation with a computational basis that could explain the psychopathology in schizophrenia. METHODS Using the object oriented programming language JavaTM we designed a system of self-objects named ‘hand’, ‘action monitor’ etc interacting with non-self objects ‘scissors’, ‘hammer’, ‘wall’, etc. In computational experiments, we allow the ‘action monitor’ to fail; the features of disparate objects are allowed to merge, some features of an object are allowed to be shared with other objects, etc.
Results
By transposing only a few lines of code, it is possible to duplicate various features of the psychopathology of schizophrenia.
Discussion
Our model can demonstrate overinclusion (overabstraction), concrete thinking (underabstraction), loss of ego boundaries (conjoining of disparate objects), delusions (misattribution of object function), lack of insight (poor monitoring of object activity) and passivity (loss of monitoring and misattribution of object activity).
Conclusion
The brain must use the OOP model in its computations. Failure of object representation and manipulation must lie at the core of the psychopathology of schizophrenia.

AB  - Prior research on collaborative learning identifies student behaviors that significantly predict student achievement, such as giving explanations of one’s thinking. Less often studied is the role of teachers’ instructional practices in collaboration among students. This article investigates the extent to which teachers engage in practices that support students’ explanations of their thinking, and how these teacher practices might be related to the nature of explanations that students give when asked by the teacher to collaborate with each other. The teachers observed here, all of whom received specific instruction in eliciting the details of student thinking, varied significantly in the extent to which they asked students to elaborate on their suggestions. This variation corresponded to variation across classrooms in the nature and extent of student explanations during collaborative conversations and to differences in student achievement.

AB  - Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have become the mainstream in skeleton-based action recognition. For further performance improvement, existing methods propose to utilize self-attention to model long-range features of joints. However, these methods cannot balance accuracy with computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Switching Partition Strategy (SPAR) Network that uses the self-attention mechanism for the simultaneous and efficient extraction of spatial–temporal long-range information from the skeleton. We design two partition strategies that reduce the computational cost and improve the efficiency of the computation of self-attention. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale datasets, i.e. NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120, to evaluate the performance of the proposed SPAR network. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on accuracy as well as computational cost.

AB  - The authors explore the noncompliant pedagogy of the image based on their video Autopoietic Veering: Schizo Socius of Tokyo and Vancouver (2021). It is not the kind of trendy modelized video abstract or kinetic presentation eagerly promoted by international publishers; it is a cross-cultural collaborative work intended to generate affirmative temporal ruptures of entropic habitual modes of seeing, memorizing, and thinking of human and nonhuman life in the cities of Tokyo (Japan) and Vancouver (Canada). The authors elucidate Stiegler’s (2015b) concept of a “global mnemotechnical system” that stores and produces human memories in vast digital archives and databases (tertiary retentions) through “mnemonic control” (Parisi & Goodman, 2011). The authors repurpose video images to interrupt and recontrol human perception and memories as “living engines” (Lazzarato, 2006). They foreground the philosophical work of Deleuze, Heidegger, and Virilio to rethink and revive the creative act of “critique” (Foucault, 1997) through “metamodelization” (Guattari, 1995; Manning, 2020); therefore, they plug these apparently incommensurable modes of thinking into their readings of the video’s images. They read the images as “time-images” and focus on their five dimensions that possibly activate “spiritual automation” (Deleuze, 1989), which they assess as “negentropic bifurcatory” potentials (Bradley & Kennedy, 2019).

Sixty-one 6- to 8-year-olds were randomly assigned to either computerized mental rotation training or literacy training. Training took place on iPad devices over a 6-week period as part of regular classroom activity. Results revealed that in comparison to the control group, children who received spatial training demonstrated significant gains on two measures of mental rotation and marginally significant improvements on an untrained mental transformation task; a finding that suggests that training may have had a general effect on children’s spatial ability. However, contrary to theoretical claims and prior empirical findings, there was no evidence that spatial training transferred to mathematics performance.

AB  - Recent progress in artificial intelligence provides the opportunity to ask the question of what is unique about human intelligence, but with a new comparison class. I argue that we can understand human intelligence, and the ways in which it may differ from artificial intelligence, by considering the characteristics of the kind of computational problems that human minds have to solve. I claim that these problems acquire their structure from three fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.

AB  - For creativity to be computed, it is paramount to understand the cognitive processes involved, which have been elucidated by either surveying creative people or discovering regions of the human brain that activate during creative endeavors. From this scattering, the author proposes a holistic framework to describe them and their interaction. Hence, creativity can be regarded as a meta process which coordinates autonomous cognitive processes such as planning or divergent thinking. To represent the interplay of cognitive processes around creativity, models are developed in the Agent Unified Modeling Language (AUML). Then, the execution of each process is delegated to autonomous agents and a global coordination protocol is devised. The implementation of the MAS is done on the JADE platform. Two modules of the resultant system are exemplified: opus planning and divergent exploration. The coordination protocol is also presented. The domain in which the software system is tested is the creation of musical pieces.

AB  - The level of moral development and moral intensity in cognitive psychology will not only affect the ethical behavior of accountants, but also have a direct impact on the quality and level of accounting work. Therefore, in this paper, the ethical behavior of accountants was analyzed from the perspective of cognitive psychology. Computer-aided data mining techniques were introduced, and government accounting risk assessment management of financial accountants was studied. In this paper, the principle of cognitive psychology to measure the ethical level of accountants was first described. The predicament of moral judgments was analyzed and an optimization plan to improve the ethical intention of accountants was proposed. Support Vector Machine classification technology in data mining was studied to explore how to conduct effective and reliable evaluation, so as to provide a scientific basis for decision-making in improving accounting management. After the simulation experiment, it is proved that continuously improving the ethical standards of accountants and strengthening the forecast of accounting risks can continue to optimize the accounting office management.

AB  - With the development of the times, celestial body search has become increasingly common, and people want to enhance their understanding of the universe through further search of celestial bodies. Nowadays, many software and hardware have been invented to assist in celestial body search, but the computational efficiency and efficiency of current software are still insufficient. So this article focuses on the research and application of Deep Learning (DL) in the search and analysis of "a certain celestial body", aiming to improve celestial search through DL. Through experiments, this article uses DL to achieve a maximum computational rate of 78% and a minimum of 70% for celestial search. The computational efficiency of celestial search without DL can reach up to 68% and 57%, respectively. After using DL, the efficiency of celestial search reaches up to 82% and 70%, while before using DL, the efficiency of celestial search reaches up to 62% and 50%, respectively. From this data, it can be seen that DL can achieve good results in celestial search.

AB  - In order to meet rapidly growing demand of liquid hydrogen in the future hydrogen industry and energy structure, the continuous catalytic ortho-para hydrogen conversion technology (CCOPHCT) has been once again proposed and has become an important choice to improve the hydrogen liquefaction units (HLUs). The origin, concept, and research progress of the CCOPHCT are systematically reviewed for the first time in this paper. However, the research depth and breadth of the CCOPHCT are insufficient to support its current application. To solve it, for the continuous catalytic ortho-para hydrogen conversion plate-fin heat exchanger (CCOPHC-PFHE) with better comprehensive performances, this paper comprehensively summarizes the research achievements in the related fields from the perspective of the unit analysis, including the ortho-para hydrogen conversion (OPHC), packing layer and plate-fin heat exchanger (PFHE), which to provide further thinking for the development of the CCOPHC-PFHE. Further, some suggestions for the CCOPHCT are proposed based on the existed research foundations, including preparing the effective ortho-para hydrogen conversion catalyst (OPHCC), developing the accurate OPHC dynamical model, revealing the coupling mechanism in the packing layer filled with the OPHCC and establishing an effective design method and standard of the CCOPHC-PFHE. In addition, considering the special conditions on the CCOPHC-PFHE, the importance of the experimental research is emphasized. And based on the established hydrogen experimental platform with the comprehensive supporting implementations, the experimental device of the CCOPHC-PFHE has been completed and a series of experimental tests are currently in progressing.

AB  - This article addresses three key questions related to the ethical facets of algorithmic literacy. First, it synthesizes existing literature to identify six core ethical components, including bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, accuracy, and non-maleficence. Second, a crosswalk maps the intersections of these principles across the Association of College and Research Libraries' Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and Joint Statement on Principles for Responsible Algorithmic Systems. This analysis reveals significant overlap on issues like unfairness and transparency, helping prioritize topics for instruction. Finally, case studies showcase pedagogical strategies for teaching ethical considerations, informed by the crosswalk. Workshops for diverse undergraduates and computer science students employed reallife instances of algorithmic bias to prompt reflection on unintended harm, contestability, and responsible development. Pre-post surveys indicated expanded critical perspectives after the interventions. By systematically examining shared values and testing instructional approaches, this study provides practical tools to shape ethical thinking on algorithms. It also demonstrates promising practices for responsibly advancing algorithmic literacy across disciplines. Ultimately, fostering interdisciplinary awareness and multipronged educational initiatives can empower students to question algorithmic authority and biases.

AB  - Computational modeling plays an increasingly important role in neuroscience, highlighting the philosophical question of how computational models explain. In the particular case of neural network models, concerns have been raised about their intelligibility, and how these models relate (if at all) to what is found in the brain. We claim that what makes a system intelligible is an understanding of the dependencies between its behavior and the factors that are responsible for that behavior. In biology, many of these dependencies are naturally “top-down”, as ethological imperatives interact with evolutionary and developmental constraints under natural selection to produce systems with capabilities and behaviors appropriate to their evolutionary needs. We describe how the optimization techniques used to construct neural network models capture some key aspects of these dependencies, and thus help explain why brain systems are as they are — because when a challenging ecologically-relevant goal is shared by a neural network and the brain, it places constraints on the possible mechanisms exhibited in both kinds of systems. The presence and strength of these constraints explain why some outcomes are more likely than others. By combining two familiar modes of explanation — one based on bottom-up mechanistic description (whose relation to neural network models we address in a companion paper) and the other based on top-down constraints, these models have the potential to illuminate brain function.

AB  - The current study investigates the Flynn Effect (FE) and its relation to abstract thinking ability. We compare two cohorts of Estonian students (1933/36, n=888; 2006, n=912) using the Concepts (Logical Selection) subtest of the Estonian adaptation of the National Intelligence Tests (NIT). The item presentation order of the subtest correlates with the abstractness of the words used in the items (r=.609) of the subtest. The different test results (right, wrong and missing answers) were analysed in order to make an estimate of the FE magnitude. The FE for abstract thinking ability of those samples was 1.06 Hedges' g (adjusted for guessing). The magnitude of the FE is dependent upon the degree of difficulty of the items (an item's difficulty is estimated by determining its abstractness and its familiarity to students). The more difficult part of the subtest (the second half) showed a FE=1.80 whereas the easier part (the first half) of the subtest showed a FE=.72. Word abstractness was a strong predictor of all the testing results in both cohorts (Beta=.700). The familiarity of words used in the test items has no correlation with the test results if word abstractness is controlled in both cohorts. Our findings support Flynn's explanation that the FE is primarily an indicator of the rise in abstract thinking ability.

AB  - With the introduction of the European Commission's “Safe and Sustainable-by-Design” (SSbD) framework, the interest in understanding the implications of safety and sustainability assessments of chemicals, materials, and processes at early-innovation stages has skyrocketed. Our study focuses on the “Safe-by-Design” (SbD) approach from the nanomaterials sector, which predates the SSbD framework. In this assessment, SbD studies have been compiled and categorized into reviews, case studies, and frameworks. Reviews of SbD tools have been further classified as quantitative, qualitative, or toolboxes and repositories. We assessed the SbD case studies and classified them into three categories: safe(r)-by-modeling, safe(r)-by-selection, or safe(r)-by-redesign. This classification enabled us to understand past SbD work and subsequently use it to define future SSbD work so as to avoid confusion and possibilities of “SSbD-washing” (similar to greenwashing). Finally, the preexisting SbD frameworks have been studied and contextualized against the SSbD framework. Several key recommendations for SSbD based on our analysis can be made. Knowledge gained from existing approaches such as SbD, green and sustainable chemistry, and benign-by-design approaches needs to be preserved and effectively transferred to SSbD. Better incorporation of chemical and material functionality into the SSbD framework is required. The concept of lifecycle thinking and the stage-gate innovation model need to be reconciled for SSbD. The development of high-throughput screening models is critical for the operationalization of SSbD. We conclude that the rapid pace of both SbD and SSbD development necessitates a regular mapping of the newly published literature that is relevant to this field.

Subjects who earned a lottery via a real-effort task were given an opportunity to switch to a dominant lottery; 23% chose to stick with their dominated lottery. The endowment effect accounts for roughly only one third of the effect. Subjects’ capacity for cognitive reflection is a significant determinant of sunk cost behavior. We also find stocks of knowledge or experience (crystallized intelligence) predict sunk cost behavior, rather than algorithmic thinking (fluid intelligence) or the personality trait of openness. We construct and validate a scale, the “SCE-8”, which encompasses many resources individuals can spend, and offers researchers an efficient way to measure susceptibility to the sunk cost effect.

AB  - Large models are widely used in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles (AV) due to their excellent new capabilities such as intelligence emergence, domain application adaptive, and multi-task learning. By integrating massive amounts of data, vehicles and transportation systems based on large models can understand the real-world environment, simulate the reasoning process of human drivers, optimize traffic flow, and improve driving safety and efficiency. However, in the practical implementation of large models, there are three key research questions: (1) How can model reasoning be consistent with the target task? (2) How to improve the redundancy of structures and weights caused by complex models? (3) How to solve the problems of supercomputing power, high latency, and large throughput of large models in practical deployment? These challenges have stimulated the development of deployment techniques for large models. Although existing review articles discuss large model technologies from singular or partial perspectives, there remains a lack of comprehensive systematic investigations into the application and deployment of large models for ITS and AV. Therefore, this paper conducted a quantitative analysis of scientific literature, demonstrating the necessity and significance of studying large models for ITS and AV. Subsequently, it outlined the concept and characteristics of large models and provided a detailed summary of the frontier progress of large models for ITS and AV. Moreover, to bridge the gap between large model inference and target tasks, address structural and weight redundancies, and tackle challenges in practical deployment such as high computational power, latency, and throughput, it explored efficient deployment techniques to accelerate the rapid deployment of large models. Finally, it discussed the challenges and future trends. This paper aims to provide researchers and engineers with an understanding of the forefront advancements and future trends of large models to facilitate the rapid implementation of large models and accelerate their development in ITS and AV.

AB  - As humans, we rely on intuitive reasoning for most of our decisions. However, when there is a novel or atypical decision to be made, we must rely on a slower and more deliberative thought process—analytical reasoning. As we gain experience with these novel or atypical decisions, our reasoning shifts from analytical to intuitive, which parallels a reduction in the need for cognitive control. Here, we sought to confirm this claim by employing electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of cognitive control as participants performed a simple perceptual decision-making task. Specifically, we had participants categorize “blobs” into families based on their visual attributes so we could examine how their reasoning changed with learning. In a key manipulation, halfway through the experiment we introduced novel blob families to categorize, thus temporarily increasing the need for analytical reasoning (i.e., cognitive control). Congruent with past research, we focused our EEG analyses on frontal theta activity as it has been linked to cognitive control and analytical thinking. As hypothesized, we found a transition from analytical to intuitive decision-making systems with learning as indexed by a decrease in frontal theta power. Further, when the novel blobs were introduced at the midpoint of the experiment, we found that decisions about these stimuli recruited analytical reasoning as indicated by increased theta power in comparison to decisions about well-practiced stimuli. We propose our findings to reflect prediction errors to decision demands—a monitoring process that determines whether our expectations of demands are met. Shifting from analytical to intuitive reasoning thus reflects the stabilization of our expectations of decision demands, which can be violated with unexpected demands when encountering novel stimuli.

They have attracted much interest from scientists and researchers due to their potential use in electrocatalysts, where a two-electron transfer process is applied. Their remarkable properties, such as strong chemical and structural stability, high electrical conductivity, and large active surface area, make them effective for their potential in advanced hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). This thorough analysis starts by carefully outlining the forward-thinking advances in MXene synthesis and development. It then explores the theoretical and empirical aspects of MXene-based HER electrocatalysts. This review paper presents methods for improving the HER catalytic activity of MXene, including terminal modification, metal-atom doping, and the creation of various nanostructures to increase the density of active sites. The study clarifies current issues and new opportunities and provides a valuable framework for the future development of effective MXene-based electrocatalysts for HERs.

Molecular modeling covers a wide range of techniques and the calculation of an even wider range of properties. Although for polymers, the possibility of treating a polymer chain quantum mechanically is formidable, it is clear that the modeling approach allows calculations on monomers, dimmers, and oligomers to guide the interpretation of many spectroscopic observations with great success. For those systems, where longer times scales and larger size scales are important, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methods are available, but the issue of the force field and the approximations that it introduces remain significant. The key to the change in attitude to modeling and its role have to lie in the availability of mature algorithms with well-known and well-understood properties. The density functional theory method in quantum mechanics has introduced a new era in applications of quantum mechanical methods.

AB  - Maximum power point (MPP) tracking (MPPT) is an important technique for maximizing the power extraction from photovoltaic (PV) systems under varying climatic conditions. In an array of PV modules it is possible to observe multiple peaks in the power versus voltage (P-V) curve due to the current versus voltage (I–V) PV cell mismatch caused by differences in the received irradiance, such as occurs during partial shading. In these circumstances, the ability of the MPPT devices to track the global MPP of the PV array directly influences the system efficiency. In the literature, various MPPT techniques have been proposed. Among them, computational intelligence (CI) algorithm based MPPT methods have demonstrated the ability to find the global MPP. This paper presents a detailed and specific review of CI- based MPPT techniques. Each method type is classified into one of several subcategories according to its application strategy. The various ways of applying CI into MPPTs are analyzed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and compared. The purpose of this study is to provide a compendium on CI-based MPPT techniques for users to understand and select an appropriate method based on application requirements and system constraints.

AB  - In the context of architectural education, design studio projects generally begin with the research of design themes and contexts; however, few attempts have been made to appreciate site analysis as reliable architectural design research. This study aims to explore strategies that link site analysis and design application to bridge the gap between research and representation as a framework for applying architectural design education. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study describes four phases of site analysis—(1) site selection, (2) site survey, (3) problem identification, and (4) suggestion for the design approach —in which visual expression of the representation technique was explored to develop a creative design approach through observation and analysis of students’ work. A curriculum that adopts the four phases of site analysis was developed based on the SPC and expanded for second-year architecture students in the university. The results showed that there are differences between architecture students in schematizing specific ideas and analysis methods, and that a substantial change in the process occurs when including visual expression in site analysis. In addition, the combination of group-based work and site analysis led to problem-solving that showed co-evolution. Finally, the study describes how research shapes site analysis and explains how representation can contribute to understanding the research. Site analysis consists of an initial attempt to explore research related to creative approaches, and may benefit both architecture educators and students.

AB  - New job skills required by the professional market have been causing significant changes in the learning process of undergraduate students. Different learning methodologies can be adopted to assist in the development of those skills, and the process of choosing the most suitable learning methodology for each situation may be complex, involving multiple and conflicting criteria. In order to support the choice of learning methodologies for the development of the “4C skills”, i.e, collaboration, communication, creativity and critical thinking, we propose a new framework based on the multiple criteria decision-making approach PROMETHEE II (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations), considering as criteria the “4C skills”, student motivation, level of learning, student comfort, decision-making capacity and time required for class preparation. Passive methods and active learning methodologies such as Guided Reciprocal Peer Questioning (GRPQ), Think-Pair-Share (TPS), and Problem Based Learning (PBL) are compared. Each methodology was applied to three groups of students of Industrial Engineering of a Brazilian University, totaling 138 students. As a result, PBL obtained the best assessment in the three groups, followed by GRPQ. The proposed framework validates the assessment of learning methodologies, providing a structure and guideline for its replication in other educational institutions.

AB  - One of the most influential descriptions of design activity emphasizes how problems and solutions “co-evolve.” This concept has somehow escaped critical review and cross-disciplinary comparison, resulting in a fragmented approach to the subject. Reviewing the published literature on design co-evolution reveals that the term is used to refer to a range of distinct concepts, and the study of co-evolution has generated a number of elaborations and alternatives. Reviewing the broader literature in design and other disciplines further reveals that discussions of design co-evolution are disconnected from the history of relevant concepts in design research, and disconnected from a range of relevant concepts in other disciplines that describe creative work. Here I examine what the different concepts of design co-evolution are, how they have been modified and what they are related to. This leads to questioning the distinction between problems and solutions, defining them in relative terms, and drawing a connection between design co-evolution and design fixation.

AB  - Packaging design, as an important element in product appearance, can directly affect customers' sensory perception of the product. Many universities even offer packaging design majors, which mainly use natural science and aesthetic knowledge to promote product sales. However, many old brands remain complacent and their packaging design still adopts traditional thinking, which to some extent affects their sales. Therefore, this article decided to use genetic algorithms as a tool to parameterize the 3D fractal images in packaging design, aiming to create more creative and eye-catching packaging designs. At the end of this article, an experiment was conducted on two branches of a certain brand. Branch 1 tried out the new design provided in this article, while Branch 2 continued to use the original design. After Branch 1 fully adopted the design, sales skyrocketed, from the original daily sales of 50-60 units to 70-85 units. Branch 2 remained unchanged, with a sharp contrast.

AB  - Three basic issues of granular computing are construction or definition of granules, measures of granules, and computation or reasoning with granules. This paper reviews the main theories of granular computing and introduces the definition of spatial granules. A granule is composed of one or more atomic granules. The rationality of this definition is explained from the four aspects: simplicity, applicability, measurability and visualization. A one-to-one correspondence is established between the granules and the points in the unit hypercube, and the coarsening and refining of the granules are the descending and ascending dimensions of the points, respectively. The weak fuzzy tolerance relation and weak fuzzy equivalence relation are defined so as to study on all fuzzy binary relations. The notion of layer granularity/fineness is introduced and each granule can be easily denoted by two numbers, which can be used to pre-process macro knowledge space and greatly improve the search speed. This paper also discusses the main properties of granules including the necessary and sufficient conditions of coarse-fine relation and the main principles of granular space.

In particular, we prove that in the Bousso–Polchinski model, the problem is NP complete. We discuss the issues this raises and the possibility that, even if we were to find compelling evidence that some vacuum of string theory describes our universe, we might never be able to find that vacuum explicitly. In a companion paper, we apply this point of view to the question of how early cosmology might select a vacuum.

AB  - Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often challenging to apply in real-world settings since evolutionary computations involve a large number of evaluations of a typically expensive fitness function. For example, an evaluation could involve training a new machine learning model. An approximation (also known as meta-model or a surrogate) of the true function can be used in such applications to alleviate the computation cost. In this paper, we propose a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary approach to address the computational issues arising from using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection in a wrapper setting for large datasets. We define “Approximation Usefulness” to capture the necessary conditions to ensure correctness of the EA computations when an approximation is used. Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. A GitHub repository with the complete implementation is available.22https://github.com/Ghaith81/Fast-Genetic-Algorithm-For-Feature-Selection.

AB  - The crucial role that the supersonic parachute plays in space exploration missions has been widely recognized, as it directly impacts the safe landing of probes. However, parachute models with optimization on different aerodynamic performances often involve design conflicts with each other. Additionally, the parachute design focusing on a single point cannot fully adapt to different speed ranges during stable descent. This complexity makes it challenging to use traditional shape design methods, which rely on empirical knowledge, to address these coupled design issues. Faced with the design challenges of Mars parachutes, this study, inspired by aircraft aerodynamic optimization principles, establishes a shape design method specifically for the stable descent phase of Mars parachutes. The method combines numerical simulation and surrogate-based optimization strategies, aiming to enhance the overall performance during stable descent and meet various demands of different exploration missions. Meanwhile, by providing a rapid estimate of the shape during the design phase, the method significantly improves computational efficiency. The optimal models effectively balance comprehensive performance in the supersonic-transonic-subsonic speed domain by conducting shape optimization research on the disk-gap-band parachute using the surrogate-based optimization strategy. Also, it exhibits better deceleration and stability across the entire speed range compared to the base model, even when deviating from the design Mach number. Importantly, the advantages of canopy-only optimization for drag performance extend to the capsule-canopy two-body system, enhancing the drag performance of the canopy in the two-body system. This strategic approach reduces the transient calculation time for the two-body system, further improving computational efficiency. The method provides a practical and forward-thinking solution for the design of Mars parachutes.

AB  - Multi-scale dense connection has been widely used in the biomedical image community to enhance the segmentation performance. In this way, features from all or most scales are aggregated or iteratively fused. However, by analyzing the details, we discover that some connections involving distant scales may not contribute to, or even harm, the performance, while they always introduce a noticeable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we propose constrained multi-scale dense connections (CMDC) for biomedical image segmentation. In contrast to current general lightweight approaches, we first introduce two methods, a naive method and a network architecture search (NAS)-based method, to remove redundant connections and verify the optimal connection configuration, thereby improving overall efficiency and accuracy. The results demonstrate that the two approaches obtain a similar optimal configuration in which most features at the adjacent scales are connected. Then, we applied the optimal configuration to various backbone networks to build constrained multi-scale dense networks (CMD-Net). Experimental results evaluated on eight image segmentation datasets covering biomedical images and natural images demonstrate the effectiveness of CMD-Net across a variety of backbone networks (FCN, U-Net, DeepLabV3, SegNet, FCNsa, ConvUNeXt) with a much lower increase in computational cost. Furthermore, CMD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available datasets. We believe that the CMDC method can offer valuable insight for ways to engage in dense connectivity at multiple scales within communities.

AB  - Our work investigates how Making may be used in the context of scientific modeling in formal elementary school science classes. This paper presents an investigation of fourth- and fifth-grade students engaging in Making activities to create simulation, concept-process, and illustrative models in the science classroom. Based on video analyses of the Making-based class sessions, a generalized process model was developed for each type of science model. In addition, cross-cutting themes were found in Making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for Making and modeling for Science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing Making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students’ overall engagement with science in the activity. We suggest that Making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their Making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between Making and science activity. We conclude that Making has the potential to support the development of scientific model thinking in the elementary science classroom, but much further research is needed in this area.

AB  - The classical notion of a ‘language of thought’ (LoT), advanced prominently by the philosopher Jerry Fodor, is an influential position in cognitive science whereby the mental representations underpinning thought are considered to be compositional and productive, enabling the construction of new complex thoughts from more primitive symbolic concepts. LoT theory has been challenged because a neural implementation has been deemed implausible. We disagree. Examples of critical computational ingredients needed for a neural implementation of a LoT have in fact been demonstrated, in particular in the hippocampal spatial navigation system of rodents. Here, we show that cell types found in spatial navigation (border cells, object cells, head-direction cells, etc.) provide key types of representation and computation required for the LoT, underscoring its neurobiological viability.

AB  - Coupling of life-cycle thinking with urban metabolism (UM) has the potential to improve sustainable urban planning. Current urban metabolism models are largely ‘black-box’ methods which do not reveal the non-linearity of feedback loops and complex internal dynamics of urban systems. The integration of system dynamics (SD) with UM based on a life-cycle thinking approach can provide built environment professionals (e.g. town planners, civil engineers, architects) with a ‘transparent-box’ solution for assessing the potential of urban projects, plans, and their implementation. This paper describes the development of a method that integrates input-output (IO) table flows with SD modelling to improve the completeness of UM assessments. This modelling framework can also allow for a ‘nested’ multi-region assessment which takes into account sustainability burdens consequent to urban system changes occurring elsewhere in the national and/or global economy. Pros and cons of this proposal are showcased by the illustration of a model for Lisbon.

AB  - We present a generalized approach to stability of static equilibria of nonlinearly elastic rods, subjected to general loading, boundary conditions and constraints (of both point-wise and integral type), based upon the linearized dynamics stability criterion. Discretization of the governing equations leads to a non-standard (singular) generalized eigenvalue problem. A new efficient sparse-matrix-friendly algorithm is presented to determine its few left-most eigenvalues, which, in turn, yield stability/instability information. For conservative problems, the eigenvalue problem arising from the linearized dynamics stability criterion is also shown to be equivalent to that arising in the determination of constrained local minima of the potential energy. We illustrate the method with several examples. A novel variational formulation for extensible and unshearable rods is also proposed within the context of one of the example problems.

Particular emphasis is given to the modeling of conformational reorganization and entropic effect. The methods reviewed are free energy perturbation, double decoupling, the Binding Energy Distribution Analysis Method, the potential of mean force method, mining minima and MM/PBSA. These models have different features and limitations, and their ranges of applicability vary correspondingly. Yet their origins can all be traced back to a single fundamental theory.

AB  - The merging of the computational theory of mind and evolutionary thinking leads to a kind of rationalism, in which enduring truths about the world have become implicit in the computations that enable the brain to cope with the experienced world. The dead reckoning computation, for example, is implemented within the brains of animals as one of the mechanisms that enables them to learn where they are (Gallistel, 1990, Gallistel, 1995). It integrates a velocity signal with respect to a time signal. Thus, the manner in which position and velocity relate to one another in the world is reflected in the manner in which signals representing those variables are processed in the brain. I use principles of information theory and Bayesian inference to derive from other simple principles explanations for: (1) the failure of partial reinforcement to increase reinforcements to acquisition; (2) the partial reinforcement extinction effect; (3) spontaneous recovery; (4) renewal; (5) reinstatement; (6) resurgence (aka facilitated reacquisition). Like the principle underlying dead-reckoning, these principles are grounded in analytic considerations. They are the kind of enduring truths about the world that are likely to have shaped the brain's computations.

AB  - The most recent information technologies have become an integral part of modern life. As the study shows, along with the obvious benefits, their use can lead to negative consequences, namely the loss of communication and soft skills, changes in the ability to absorb information, decreased motivation to acquire new knowledge among the younger age group. The authors propose a new methodology for organizing the educational process Study-Train-Explain. The aim of the method is to increase the Student Talking Time parameter to develop the skills of mathematical data analysis, systematic and analytical thinking to master the methods of description and construction of mathematical model of the phenomenon or process. These competencies are extremely in demand in the professional field related to the organization of transportation and operation of transport-technological machines and complexes under the conditions of digitalization of global processes. The article presents an algorithm and the results of the experimental training process carried out by the authors according to the specified methodology.

AB  - As computer programming and computational thinking (CT) become more integrated into K-12 instruction, content teachers and special educators need to understand how to provide instructional supports to a wide range of learners, including students with disabilities. This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.

AB  - The $-calculus is the extension of the π-calculus, built around the central notion of cost and allowing infinity in its operators. We propose the $-calculus as a more complete model for problem solving to provide a support to handle intractability and undecidability. It goes beyond the Turing Machine model. We define the semantics of the $-calculus using a novel optimization method (the kΩ-optimization), which approximates a nonexisting universal search algorithm and allows the simulation of many other search methods. In particular, the notion of total optimality has been utilized to provide an automatic way to deal with intractability of problem solving by optimizing together the quality of solutions and search costs. The sufficient conditions needed for completeness, optimality and total optimality of problem solving search are defined. A very flexible classification scheme of problem solving methods into easy, hard and solvable in the limit classes has been proposed. In particular, the third class deals with non-recursive solutions of undecidable problems. The approach is illustrated by solutions of some intractable and undecidable problems. We also briefly overview two possible implementations of the $-calculus.

AB  - In this new era, technological advancement toward the mission of a better tomorrow is reaching its limit because the exploration of the advanced possibilities of Artificial Intelligence is bounded with certain limitations. The application of analyzing various features of biosignal processing is key in the fields of medicine and healthcare. Biosignals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electrooculography (EOG), Galvanic Skin Response(GSR), and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is already giving deep insight into the human body toward the identification of diverse nature and disorders. In recent years, the research toward analyzing biosignal gained interest among many researchers. The primary limitation for the algorithms to analyze these signals for more possibilities of insight is its uncertainty. Even though the algorithms of Artificial Intelligence have the capabilities to unravel the mysteries, it is bounded with specific difficulties. The machine learning algorithms designed to manage uncertain data but lacks accuracy due to many factors. Also, complete supervision is needed in a training process that involves the extraction and selection of adequate features for the training. The deep learning method (a subset of machine learning) comes into the picture due to one of these facts. This, indeed, as a supervised learning method, needs a massive volume of data to train to reach the accuracy goal. The deep learning algorithm plays a significant role in today's Artificial Intelligence–based applications. However, this platform needs many requirements, such as (a) high computational power like graphical processing units (GPU); (b) similar to machine learning methods, a massive labeled dataset for supervised learning; (c) adequate parameter selection to avoid overfitting or underfitting. To overcome the problems highlighted, the strategy of adopting the behaviors of unsupervised learning (performed by the clustering algorithm) in the deep learning methodology is needed. To achieve the goal, two-phase operations were processed, such as (1) transformation of the data elements into a latent feature space (Z) is processed through a nonlinear mapping of deep learning networks; (2) clustering the latent feature space to k-clusters, and simultaneously, the clustering loss is fed to the deep learning network for the next iteration of operation concerning the objective function convergence analyzed by the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Various strategies of enhancing the nature of deep learning methods and clustering methodologies for an unsupervised learning process are addressed in this chapter.

AB  - Experimental tests of choice predictions in one-shot games show only little support for Nash equilibrium (NE). Poisson Cognitive Hierarchy (PCH) and level-k (LK) are behavioral models of the thinking-steps variety where subjects differ in the number of levels of iterated reasoning they perform. Camerer et al. (2004) claim that substituting the Poisson parameter τ=1.5 yields a parameter-free PCH model (pfPCH) which predicts experimental data considerably better than NE. We design a new multi-person game, the Minimizer Game, as a testbed to compare initial choice predictions of NE, pfPCH and LK. Data obtained from two large-scale online experiments strongly reject NE and LK, but are well in line with the point-prediction of pfPCH.

AB  - Sustainable development poses a grand challenge for society, addressed by organisations through their public relations activities. Grand challenges are complex by nature and call for nontrivial solutions whose effects show at the level of society. That is why studying public relations’ contribution to grand challenges requires a macro perspective that accounts for the dynamic interaction between individual, organisational, and system levels in a digital communication environment. This paper offers a new paradigm to analyse organisations’ significant and at times undue impact on grand challenges through public relations. It develops a framework inspired by complex adaptive systems thinking and adopts its ten properties for public relations: emergence, adaptivity, heterogeneous actors, nonlinear effects, feedback mechanisms, self-organisation, phase transitions, networks, scaling, and cooperation. The paper applies the framework to the example of sustainable development. It shows why research on grand challenges requires a holistic perspective and how it can help study digitally born communication phenomena. The proposed complex systems paradigm provides space for critical, social scientific, and interpretative research lines in public relations. Inquiries start from the grand challenge and study the communicative interactions between organisations and other actors from existing theory while accounting for the ten properties of complex adaptive systems. The paper outlines how future research can enrich the study of public relations and discusses its limits.

AB  - Pair programming (PP) is a usefulness approach to fostering computational thinking (CT) for young students. However, there are many factors to impact the effectiveness of PP. Among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.

AB  - Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which exploit both the labeled and unlabeled data, have attracted a lot of attention. One of the major categories of SSL methods, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL) learns labels of unlabeled data on an adjacency graph, where neighborhood sparse graph is often used to reduce computational complexity. However, the neighborhood size is difficult to set. Instead of assigning a concrete value of neighborhood size, we propose a new label propagation algorithm called multi granularity based label propagation (MGLP) and developed from the view of granular computing. In MGLP, labels of unlabeled data are learned by two classic label propagation processes with diverse neighborhood size k, where granular computing delivers a guiding strategy to leverage multiple level neighborhood information granules, and three-way decision acts as an active learning strategy to select the unlabeled data for further annotating. Through the iterative procedures of label propagating, data annotating and data subset updating, the ultimate pseudo label accuracy of unlabeled data may be higher. Theoretically, the accuracy of pseudo labels is enhanced in some scenarios. Experimentally, the results of simulation studies on ten benchmark datasets, show that the proposed method MGLP can rise pseudo labels accuracy by 8.6% than LP (label propagation), 6.5% than LNP (linear neighborhood propagation), 6.4% than LPSN (label propagation through sparse neighborhood), 4.5% than Adaptive-NP (adaptive neighborhood propagation) and 4.6% than CRLP (consensus rate-based label propagation). It also provides a novel way to annotate data.

AB  - The distinction between convergent and divergent cognitive processes given by Guilford (1956) had a strong influence on the empirical research on creative thinking. Neuroscientific studies typically find higher event-related synchronization in the EEG alpha rhythm for individuals engaged in creative ideation tasks compared to intelligence-related tasks. This study examined, whether these neurophysiological effects can also be found when both cognitive processing modes (convergent vs. divergent) are assessed by means of the same task employing a simple variation of instruction. A sample of 55 participants performed the alternate uses task as well as a more basic word association task while EEG was recorded. On a trial-by-trial basis, participants were either instructed to find a most common solution (convergent condition) or a most uncommon solution (divergent condition). The answers given in the divergent condition were in both tasks significantly more original than those in the convergent condition. Moreover, divergent processing was found to involve higher task-related EEG alpha power than convergent processing in both the alternate uses task and the word association task. EEG alpha synchronization can hence explicitly be associated with divergent cognitive processing rather than with general task characteristics of creative ideation tasks. Further results point to a differential involvement of frontal and parietal cortical areas by individuals of lower versus higher trait creativity.

AB  - Printed Circuit Heat Exchangers are compact and efficient heat exchangers, widely used in nuclear engineering, very high-temperature reactors, and aerospace systems. This study investigates the heat transfer performance of a heat exchanger with anisotropic thermal conductivity, such as fiber reinforced composites. Numerical simulations were conducted to examine the synergistic effect of three-dimensional thermal resistance on heat exchanger performance. The most significant impact on performance is the z-direction thermal resistance, followed by the y-direction, while the x-direction has the least impact. Contrary to traditional design thinking, increasing the overall heat exchanger thermal resistance under the same thermal resistance ratio improves heat transfer efficiency at the studied conditions. The results suggest that it is necessary to design the lowest thermal conductivity direction as the z-direction and increase the y-direction thermal conductivity to enhance heat exchanger performance. In the numerical investigation presented in this study, the efficiency of the heat exchanger was improved by approximately 23 % under specific operating conditions by adjusting the thermal conductivity of anisotropic materials to control the thermal resistance in the x, y and z directions. It is evident that the manipulation of anisotropic material properties has a substantial influence on the performance of heat exchangers.

AB  - Automation of teaching people new skills requires modeling of human reasoning because human cognition involves active reasoning over the new subject domain to acquire skills that will later become automatic. The article presents Thought Process Trees — a language for modeling human reasoning that was created to facilitate the development of intelligent tutoring systems, which can perform the same reasoning that is expected of a student and find deficiencies in their line of thinking, providing explanatory messages and allowing them to learn from performance errors. The methodology of building trees which better reflect human learning is discussed, with examples of design choices during the modeling process and their consequences. The characteristics of educational modeling that impact building subject-domain models for intelligent tutoring systems are discussed. The trees were formalized and served as a basis for developing a framework for constructing intelligent tutoring systems. This significantly lowered the time required to build and debug a constraint-based subject-domain model. The framework has already been used to develop five intelligent tutoring systems and their prototypes and is being used to develop more of them.

The important result of this evolution is the human thinking, which is used at scientific cognition of nature. The related epistemological viewpoints of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Konrad Lorenz, and Eugene Wigner are outlined. The sketch program for future investigations of cognitive evolution is proposed; initial models of these studies are outlined. According to the presented analysis, it is possible to believe the following. Investigations of cognitive evolution are directed to analyze the fundamental problems: “Why is human thinking applicable to cognition of nature?”, “How did human thinking origin in the process of biological evolution?” There are powerful backgrounds for considered investigations: (1) models of autonomous cognitive agents, (2) biological investigations of animal cognitive features. Studies of cognitive evolution would have broad interdisciplinary relations. These studies should contribute significantly to the development of the scientific point of view.

AB  - Several judgment and decision-making tasks require overriding an incorrect response that is signaled by miserly information processes. The successful detection and override of conflict between heuristic and analytic processes has been a focus of dual processes models, especially in adult samples. These miserly processing tendencies have also been described in developmental samples. The measurement of resistance to miserly information processing has been assessed using several tasks, including ratio bias, belief bias syllogisms, cognitive reflection, and disjunctive thinking tasks. Several of these tasks have been studied in developmental samples, including in the longitudinal study described in this volume. There is evidence to suggest that resistance to miserly information processing is measurable in children and youth. While judgment and decision-making tasks vary in the degree to which override of miserly processing is required, individuals also vary in their ability to resist miserly processing tendencies. Individual differences in resistance to miserly information processing serve as an additional foundation to support rational thinking performance.

AB  - Organismal behavior, with its tremendous complexity and diversity, is generated by numerous physiological systems acting in coordination. Understanding how these systems evolve to support differences in behavior within and among species is a longstanding goal in biology that has captured the imagination of researchers who work on a multitude of taxa, including humans. Of particular importance are the physiological determinants of behavioral evolution, which are sometimes overlooked because we lack a robust conceptual framework to study mechanisms underlying adaptation and diversification of behavior. Here, we discuss a framework for such an analysis that applies a “systems view” to our understanding of behavioral control. This approach involves linking separate models that consider behavior and physiology as their own networks into a singular vertically integrated behavioral control system. In doing so, hormones commonly stand out as the links, or edges, among nodes within this system. To ground our discussion, we focus on studies of manakins (Pipridae), a family of Neotropical birds. These species have numerous physiological and endocrine specializations that support their elaborate reproductive displays. As a result, manakins provide a useful example to help imagine and visualize the way systems concepts can inform our appreciation of behavioral evolution. In particular, manakins help clarify how connectedness among physiological systems—which is maintained through endocrine signaling—potentiate and/or constrain the evolution of complex behavior to yield behavioral differences across taxa. Ultimately, we hope this review will continue to stimulate thought, discussion, and the emergence of research focused on integrated phenotypes in behavioral ecology and endocrinology.

AB  - New sixteen uric acid metal complexes of different stoichiometry, stereo-chemistries and modes of interactions were synthesized using different metals Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, UO2, Na and K. The synthesized complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, spectral (IR, UV–Vis and ESR) methods, thermal analysis (TG, DTA and DSC) and magnetic susceptibility studies. Molecular modeling calculations were used to characterize the ligation sites of the free ligand. Furthermore, quantum chemical parameters of uric acid such as the energies of highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), energies of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), the separation energy (ΔE=ELUMO−EHOMO), the absolute electronegativity, χ, the chemical potential, Pi, the absolute hardness, η and the softness (σ) were obtained for uric acid. Eight different microbial categories were used to study the antimicrobial activity of the free ligand and ten of its complexes. The results indicate that the ligand and its metal complexes possess antimicrobial properties. The stoichiometry of iron–uric acid complex was studied by using different spectrophotometric methods.

AB  - The design of hospital spatial layouts is a critical aspect of healthcare architecture, directly influencing patient outcomes, staff efficiency, and the overall quality of care. A well-designed hospital layout is essential for ensuring smooth operations, minimizing errors, and improving both patient and staff experiences. This paper reviews the significant advances in the field, particularly focusing on the transition from traditional design methods to the integration of computational techniques and machine learning (ML) in hospital layout planning. Despite these technological advancements, there remains a notable gap in the full adoption and optimization of these methods to effectively address the inherent complexities of healthcare environments. This review identifies that while computational methods and machine learning-driven approaches have brought precision and innovation to hospital design, the challenge lies in balancing these technologies with the expertise and insights of human designers. Moreover, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between architects, healthcare professionals, and engineers is emphasized as crucial for the successful implementation of advanced design strategies. Insights from this review highlight the potential of future research to bridge the existing gaps, proposing directions for the continuous integration of technology in hospital layout design.

AB  - Summary
Consideration of compound drivers and impacts are often missing from applications within the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) cycle, leading to poorer understanding of risk and benefits of actions. The need to include compound considerations is known, but lack of guidance is prohibiting practitioners from including these considerations. This article makes a step toward practitioner guidance by providing examples where consideration of compound drivers, hazards, and impacts may affect different application domains within disaster risk management. We discern five DRR categories and provide illustrative examples of studies that highlight the role of “compound thinking” in early warning, emergency response, infrastructure management, long-term planning, and capacity building. We conclude with a number of common elements that may contribute to the development of practical guidelines to develop appropriate applications for risk management.

AB  - The underground pipeline network (UPN) is an essential infrastructure and plays an irreplaceable role in national defense and urban activities. The complexity of structural environment and management makes its operation and maintenance difficult. To solve this problem, a distributed mixed reality (MR) and internet of things (IoT) system is developed through game thinking. Firstly, digital models are created based on design drawings and real-world environments, and then an MR system for the UPN is built by the game engine and the OpenXR platform. Secondly, an IoT cloud platform is built to connect with the MR system based on the API sets and cloud services; the data communication between sensors and MR devices is linked with the Socket method, and the data filtering model is constructed by the Kalman algorithm to realize the information exchange between the field workers and the backend managers. Finally, the National Center for Materials Service Safety at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (NCMS_USTB) is used as the experimental site to test this system, and its underground sewage and rainwater pipeline network are used to simulate the key problems in the operation and maintenance. The effect of the application shows that there is potential technical complementarity between the MR and IoT, and the distributed MR-IoT approach can be used as a new technical reference for the operation and maintenance of the UPN.

AB  - In the last decade many publications have appeared on degrowth as a strategy to confront environmental and social problems. We undertake a systematic review of their content, data and methods. This involves the use of computational linguistics to identify main topics investigated. Based on a sample of 561 studies we conclude that: (1) content covers 11 main topics; (2) the large majority (almost 90%) of studies are opinions rather than analysis; (3) few studies use quantitative or qualitative data, and even fewer ones use formal modelling; (4) the first and second type tend to include small samples or focus on non-representative cases; (5) most studies offer ad hoc and subjective policy advice, lacking policy evaluation and integration with insights from the literature on environmental/climate policies; (6) of the few studies on public support, a majority concludes that degrowth strategies and policies are socially-politically infeasible; (7) various studies represent a “reverse causality” confusion, i.e. use the term degrowth not for a deliberate strategy but to denote economic decline (in GDP terms) resulting from exogenous factors or public policies; (8) few studies adopt a system-wide perspective – instead most focus on small, local cases without a clear implication for the economy as a whole. We illustrate each of these findings for concrete studies.

AB  - This paper presents a strategy for fostering digital citizenship at school that transcends the mere use of digital devices or instructional methods focused solely on their use. The core premise of this proposal rests on the need for an ethical-political debate concerning digitization in education. In addition, it emphasizes the need to cultivate a form of digital literacy that blends science and technology with the humanities, and erases the traditional boundaries between making and thinking. The proposed approach encapsulates two primary concerns: firstly, it asserts that digital literacy serves as a foundation for meaningful participation in digital societies; secondly, it underscores the importance of democratizing digital technologies by incorporating the perspectives, needs, and concerns of children. Drawing inspiration from the theories of pragmatism and responsible research and innovation (RRI), we present a conceptual framework for digital citizenship. To operationalize this approach, we adapt John Dewey's pragmatic model of inquiry as a method that can be applied within the school setting. This pragmatic methodology serves as a conduit for developing hands-on experience geared towards developing digital citizenship. The practical implementation of this methodology is illustrated through an actualized experience with 10- and 11-year-old children in a public primary school, regarding the issue of care robots. This paper advocates for a symbiotic relationship between theoretical understanding and practical application, and puts forward a concrete proposal for the integration of digital citizenship in schools in the form of a four-phase procedural model, based on the creation of what we term ‘the encounter’ between the educational community and the research and development community.

AB  - Computer game programming has been touted as a promising strategy for engaging children in the kinds of thinking that will prepare them to be producers, not just users of technology. But little is known about what they learn when programming a game. In this article, we present a strategy for coding student games, and summarize the results of an analysis of 108 games created by middle school girls using Stagecast Creator in an after school class. The findings show that students engaged in moderate levels of complex programming activity, created games with moderate levels of usability, and that the games were characterized by low levels of code organization and documentation. These results provide evidence that game construction involving both design and programming activities can support the learning of computer science concepts.

AB  - Management in complex environments requires knowledge about temporal contingencies. Expectations about durations enable us to prepare for important events in good time, but also to detect irregularities. Unfortunately, time perception is not invariant. Situational aspects as well as features of the task at hand may dramatically change our sense of time. Particularly under varying workload conditions, temporal distortions may lead to performance errors. A valid and reliable model of time perception must account for these characteristics. Based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004), we developed a computational model in line with this requirement. Specific emphasis was placed on mechanisms of coordinative working memory which seem to influence time encoding and perception. The model’s assumptions were tested in three steps. First, the model was applied to account for time distortions ‘a posteriori’. Effects of varying working memory demands reported by Dutke (2005) were replicated and explained by simulations of the model. Second, the model was used for predicting effects ‘a priori’. Augmenting Dutke’s (2005) approach by switching between different degrees of memory demands, predictions of time distortions were derived from the model. These predictions were compared with experimental data. Central assumptions of the model were supported, but there were also some deviations that the model had not captured. Based on the conclusions from the results of the experiment, a second a priori testing addressed temporal expectations in a complex task using a micro-world scenario. The results support the interpretation of the previous experiment and provide new insights for modelling time perception. In summary, our results indicate that coordinative working memory – in contrast to general attention – causes differences in timing performance. This characteristic is captured by our approach. The model we propose heavily relies on mechanisms of working memory and can be applied to explain effects for different time intervals, under a variety of experimental conditions and in different task environments.

AB  - This study investigated introductory computer science (CS1) students’ implicit beliefs of intelligence. Referencing Dweck and Leggett’s (1988) framework for implicit beliefs of intelligence, we examined how (1) students’ implicit beliefs changed over the course of a semester, (2) these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profile, and (3) implicit beliefs predicted student learning based on standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test. For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses. Theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for STEM educators are discussed.

AB  - Resilience Engineering principles are becoming increasingly popular in healthcare to improve patient safety. FRAM is the best-known Resilience Engineering method with several examples of its application in healthcare available. However, the guidance on how to apply FRAM leaves gaps, and this can be a potential barrier to its adoption and potentially lead to misuse and disappointing results. The article provides a self-reflective analysis of FRAM use cases to provide further methodological guidance for successful application of FRAM to improve patient safety. Five FRAM use cases in a range of healthcare settings are described in a structured way including critical reflection by the original authors of those studies. Individual reflections are synthesised through group discussion to identify lessons for the operationalisation of FRAM in healthcare. Four themes are developed: (1) core characteristics of a FRAM study, (2) flexibility regarding the underlying epistemological paradigm, (3) diversity with respect to the development of interventions, and (4) model complexity. FRAM is a systems analysis method that offers considerable flexibility to accommodate different epistemological positions, ranging from realism to phenomenology. We refer to these as computational FRAM and reflexive FRAM, respectively. Practitioners need to be clear about their analysis aims and their analysis position. Further guidance is needed to support practitioners to tell a convincing and meaningful “system story” through the lens of FRAM.

AB  - Early research investigated young students' understandings of science concepts using physical equipment, but technological advances now mean there are new options to introduce these ideas, through devices such as iPads and simulations. However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.

AB  - Process systems engineering (PSE) has been an active research field for almost 50 years. Its major achievements include methodologies and tools to support process modeling, simulation and optimization (MSO). Mature, commercially available technologies have been penetrating all fields of chemical engineering in academia as well as in industrial practice. MSO technologies have become a commodity, they are not a distinguishing feature of the PSE field any more. Consequently, PSE has to reassess and to reposition its future research agenda. Emphasis should be put on model-based applications in all PSE domains including product and process design, control and operations. Furthermore, systems thinking and systems problem solving have to be prioritized rather than the mere application of computational problem solving methods. This essay reflects on the past, present and future of PSE from an academic and industrial point of view. It redefines PSE as an active and future-proof research field which can play an active role in providing enabling technologies for product and process innovations in the chemical industries and beyond.

AB  - The investigation of how users make sense of the data provided by information systems is very important for human computer interaction. In this context, understanding the interaction processes of users plays an important role. The analysis of interaction sequences, for example, can provide a deeper understanding about how users solve problems. In this paper we present an analysis of sequences of interactions within a visualization system and compare the results to previous research. We used log file analysis and thinking aloud as methods. There is some indication based on log file analysis that there are interaction patterns which can be generalized. Thinking aloud indicates that some cognitive processes occur together with a higher probability than others.

AB  - MCVT (Making Computing Visible and Tangible) Cards are a toolkit of paper-based computing cards intended for use in the codesign of inclusive computing education. Working with groups of teachers and students over multiple design sessions, we share our toolkit, design drivers and material considerations; and use cases drawn from a week-long codesign workshop where seven teachers made and adapted cards for their future classroom facilitation. Our findings suggest that teachers valued the MCVT toolkit as a resource for their own learning and perceived the cards to be useful for supporting new computational practices, specifically for learning through making and connecting to examples of everyday computing. Critically reviewed by teachers during codesign workshops, the toolkit however posed some implementation challenges and constraints for learning through making and troubleshooting circuitry. From teacher surveys, interviews, workshop video recordings, and teacher-constructed projects, we show how teachers codesigned new design prototypes and pedagogical activities while also adapting and extending paper-based computing materials so their students could take advantage of the unique technical and expressive affordances of MCVT Cards. Our design research contributes a new perspective on using interactive paper computing cards as a medium for instructional materials development to support more inclusive computing education.

AB  - Product innovation design process involves a great deal of discrete engineering knowledge, limiting the ability of designers to quickly utilize this knowledge to support design innovation. Nowadays, innovation design based on knowledge graphs has enhanced the ability to explore design knowledge, improving the efficiency of knowledge retrieval. Previous studies have focused on mining more design knowledge to enrich the knowledge graph overlooks the implicit relationships with potential value among design knowledge, wasting design resources. To address these issues, an approach for product innovation design based on implicit knowledge relationship completion in the patent knowledge graph is proposed, which explores the implicit relationships between design knowledge to provide new knowledge satisfying design preferences and enhance the innovativeness of solutions. First, a requirements-function-structure-benefit (RFSB) knowledge ontology is constructed and extracted from the benefit knowledge of patents to build the knowledge graph. Second, an implicit relationship completion model based on the similarity of function or benefit entities explores the implicit relationships, replacing structure entities directly connected to similar function or benefit entities to generate new relationships and outputs novel ideas. Third, a scheme improvement process based on the co-occurrence frequency of requirement and structure knowledge supplements neglected design preferences. Final, a pipeline inspection robot case study is further employed to verify the proposed approach, and a patent knowledge graph assisted design solution prototype system is developed to assist in the utilization of innovative design knowledge. Evaluation results show the significant design potential of the proposed approach in inspiring innovative thinking and knowledge reuse.

AB  - There is an increasing emphasis on teaching young learners to code; yet, there are few tools designed to measure the effect of learning to code on children. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.

AB  - Sensorimotor integration is an active domain of speech research and is characterized by two main ideas, that the auditory system is critically involved in speech production and that the motor system is critically involved in speech perception. Despite the complementarity of these ideas, there is little crosstalk between these literatures. We propose an integrative model of the speech-related “dorsal stream” in which sensorimotor interaction primarily supports speech production, in the form of a state feedback control architecture. A critical component of this control system is forward sensory prediction, which affords a natural mechanism for limited motor influence on perception, as recent perceptual research has suggested. Evidence shows that this influence is modulatory but not necessary for speech perception. The neuroanatomy of the proposed circuit is discussed as well as some probable clinical correlates including conduction aphasia, stuttering, and aspects of schizophrenia.

AB  - A long tradition of research on mathematical thinking has focused on procedural knowledge, or knowledge of how to solve problems and enact procedures. In recent years, however, there has been a shift toward focusing, not only on solving problems, but also on conceptual knowledge. In the current work, we reviewed (1) how conceptual knowledge is defined in the mathematical thinking literature, and (2) how conceptual knowledge is defined, operationalized, and measured in three mathematical domains: equivalence, cardinality, and inversion. We uncovered three general issues. First, few investigators provide explicit definitions of conceptual knowledge. Second, the definitions that are provided are often vague or poorly operationalized. Finally, the tasks used to measure conceptual knowledge do not always align with theoretical claims about mathematical understanding. Together, these three issues make it challenging to understand the development of conceptual knowledge, its relationship to procedural knowledge, and how it can best be taught to students. In light of these issues, we propose a general framework that divides conceptual knowledge into two facets: knowledge of general principles and knowledge of the principles underlying procedures.

AB  - Financial attitude influences the financial behavior of retail investors. Although the extant research has acknowledged and examined this relationship, the measures of financial attitude and behavior still vary widely and are generally posed as a series of questions rather than statements. In addition to this, there is insufficient knowledge regarding retail investors' behavior in the face of a health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study addresses these gaps in the prior literature by examining the relative influence of six dimensions of financial attitude, namely, financial anxiety, optimism, financial security, deliberative thinking, interest in financial issues, and needs for precautionary savings, on the trading activity of retail investors during the pandemic. Data were collected from 404 respondents and analyzed using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results revealed that all six dimensions had a positive influence on trading activity, with interest in financial issues exerting the strongest influence, followed by deliberative thinking. The study thus contributes important inferences for researchers and managers.

AB  - Home Energy Management (HEM) has a significantly growing impact on strategic energy policy, digital equity, as well as housing development and transport issues. With the proliferation of home working, reliance on electricity for heating and cooling and the increasing needs for electric charging for transportation, there is an urgent need to develop novel ways for efficient management of home energy use. Current efforts focus on HEM technologies at individual household levels, without considering the social or spatial context or their collective community-wide interrelated dependencies. We propose a multifaceted agenda at the intersection of disciplinary domains to tackle this problem by using a multidimensional lens that draws on energy behaviour, architectural research, biomimetics, and computational design, simultaneously. Optimal and effective behavioural patterns can be extracted and abstracted from nature, informing a more collective and interrelated behavioural dependencies approach that considers the complex multidimensional energy use patterns of different housing typologies. This paper discusses the analytical benefits of this new research approach through a study of home energy management behaviour. The approach though could be expanded to consider other similar empirical contexts whereby sustainable multidimensional resource management is sought such as water use, food distribution as well as transport and mobility.

AB  - Decision making is an interdisciplinary field, which is explored with methods spanning from economic experiments to brain scanning. Its dominant paradigms such as utility theory, prospect theory, and the modern dual-process theories all resort to formal algebraic models or non-mathematical postulates, and remain purely phenomenological. An approach introduced by Grossberg deployed differential equations describing neural networks and bridged the gap between decision science and the psychology of cognitive–emotional interactions. However, the limits within which neural models can explain data from real people’s actions are virtually untested and remain unknown. Here we show that a model built around a recurrent gated dipole can successfully forecast individual economic choices in a complex laboratory experiment. Unlike classical statistical and econometric techniques or machine learning algorithms, our method calibrates the equations for each individual separately, and carries out prediction person-by-person. It predicted very well the behaviour of 15%–20% of the participants in the experiment–half of them extremely well–and was overall useful for two thirds of all 211 subjects. The model succeeded with people who were guided by gut feelings and failed with those who had sophisticated strategies. One hypothesis is that this neural network is the biological substrate of the cognitive system for primitive–intuitive thinking, and so we believe that we have a model of how people choose economic options by a simple form of intuition. We anticipate our study to be useful for further studies of human intuitive thinking as well as for analyses of economic systems populated by heterogeneous agents.

KW  - Reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis
AB  - The image decomposition based method is one of the efficient and important face recognition solutions for the single sample per person problem. The low image decomposition performance and the unconvincing reconstruction of the approximation image are the two main limitations of the previous methods. In this paper, a new single sample face recognition method based on lower-upper (LU) decomposition algorithm is proposed. The procedure of the proposed method is as following. First, the single sample and its transpose are decomposed to two sets of basis images by using the LU decomposition algorithm, which is more efficient than the image decomposition algorithms of the previous works. Two approximation images are reconstructed from the two basis image sets by the reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis. Then, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) algorithm is used to evaluate the optimal projection space by using the new training set consisting of the single sample and its two approximation images for each person. Finally, the nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance is adopted as the final classification. We make two main contributions: one is that we propose to decompose the single sample and its transpose using the efficient LU decomposition algorithm, and reorder each basis image set according to the basis image energy; the other is that we present a reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis to reconstruct the approximation image. The performance of the proposed method is verified using four public face databases, namely FERET, AR, ORL and Yale B. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches which are proposed to address the single sample per person problem.

AB  - Student-Centred Active Learning of Systems Engineering and Sustainability requires challenging metacognitive integration of high-level evaluation skills combined with discipline-based core knowledge. This two-part series aims to demonstrate the basic principles, methodology and specific examples of active learning with formative assessment implemented to achieve improved student academic performance. In this part I of the two-part series, firstly, a detailed description is introduced of the cognitive learning methodology which makes use of student-centered recognition, analysis and synthesis for decision-making when there is no entirely right or wrong decision. The concept of “decision situation” is described which combines several surrounding and contingency elements to arrive at a demonstration of the holistic decision-making through systems analysis. A Holistic thinking approach is further developed using a systems learning methodology that combines normative with descriptive analyses to arrive at a cognitive mode model of judgement and choice. Sustainability modelling using the three-gateway systems approach is introduced and compared with the multi-layered view of chemical and biochemical engineering education and research; see Gani et al. (2020). Holistic thinking strategy is applied most recently to integrating, backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy (CE); see Mendoza et al. (2017). A student-centred learning approach is advocated that makes use of these principles and enables the systematic embedding of sustainability modeling in industrial and economic activities whose success rely substantively on decision-making. Finally, the relative importance is evaluated using classroom data available with specific engineering topics of the didactic “rule-based” methods of knowledge transfer in contrast with the experiential accumulation of practical information amassed through social interactions in a co-operative learning environment that relies on sustained improvement through active communication and feedback between the teacher/instructor and the student/learner; see Stephan et al. (2017) and Shallcross and Alpay (2018).

AB  - Creativity is related to a higher flexible semantic memory structure, which could explain greater fluency of ideas. Extensive research has identified a positive connection between creativity and bi-/multilingualism mainly in contexts where two languages or more concur in daily communicative interactions. Yet, creativity has received scant attention in regard to L2 (second or foreign language) acquisition that mainly takes place in classroom situations. The scarce research points to a positive relationship between creativity and L2 fluency – understood as the number of words produced. We apply computational network science analysis and Forward Flow methods to examine lexical organization patterns of a low creativity (LC) and high creativity (HC) group of 12th grade Spanish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The participants completed two fluency tasks, where they generated animal names in their L2, and also L1 – used here as a control measure. EFL proficiency was controlled. Our analyses revealed that the HC individuals were more fluent in L1 and L2, generated more remote responses, and exhibited a more flexible and efficiently structured semantic memory in both languages, with a greater effect of creativity in L2. Contrary to previous research, the L2 semantic memory network exhibited a less random organization. Differences in the L2 learning conditions are adduced as likely causes of this result.

Despite the widespread use of personalization of eHealth technologies, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding its application. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by identifying and clustering different personalization approaches based on the type of variables used for user segmentation and the adaptations to the eHealth technology and examining the role of computational methods in the literature. From the 412 included reports, we identified 13 clusters of personalization approaches, such as behavior + channeling and environment + recommendations. Within these clusters, 10 computational methods were utilized to match segments with technology adaptations, such as classification-based methods and reinforcement learning. Several gaps were identified in the literature, such as the limited exploration of technology-related variables, the limited focus on user interaction reminders, and a frequent reliance on a single type of variable for personalization. Future research should explore leveraging technology-specific features to attain individualistic segmentation approaches.

AB  - If O2 is for I, then what is O2 for AI? What is oxygen for humans is what is object-oriented thinking for artificial intelligent systems. Much the same way as humans need O2 knowingly or unknowingly, the first step in designing an AI system requires the application of object-oriented principles either explicitly or implicitly. The basis of the definition of state in AI is a description of the concept of interest as an object with properties. The idea of an object extends beyond typical noun forms that describe elements of the real world. The verb forms are included as well with -able suffixes such as runnable, serializable, and executable. In the software world, the first step in modeling a business requirement is the identification of objects of interest and defining their properties and interactions. For instance, in the case of web services, a service is an object; in the case of database systems, a table or a transaction is an object; or in the case of large-scale integration, electronic components are objects. The concept of an object extends beyond the software realm and into the mathematical world in an implicit form. Functional analysis is an old topic in mathematics where each function is an object indeed. The concept of space in mathematics relates closely to the possible value ranges of all attributes of an object. Mathematical operators are the same as methods of objects. It is day-to-day practical life in any modern operating system software dealing with process objects and applications such as Python scripts involving function objects. In this chapter, the application of object-oriented thinking to convert a business requirement to a machine learning (ML) formulation is presented with examples. The five steps of supervised ML formulation based on vector representations of input and output, mapping function, loss function, and data set are clarified. The scope and limitation of ML formulation as against general AI methodology are discussed to demystify popular myths. This chapter also reveals the secret behind the success of deep learning methodology as automatic differentiation involving function objects.

Executive control, the ability to organize thoughts and action plans in real time, is a defining feature of higher cognition. Classical theories have emphasized cortical contributions to this process, but recent studies have reinvigorated interest in the role of the thalamus. Although it is well established that local thalamic damage diminishes cognitive capacity, such observations have been difficult to inform functional models. Recent progress in experimental techniques is beginning to enrich our understanding of the anatomical, physiological, and computational substrates underlying thalamic engagement in executive control. In this review, we discuss this progress and particularly focus on the mediodorsal thalamus, which regulates the activity within and across frontal cortical areas. We end with a synthesis that highlights frontal thalamocortical interactions in cognitive computations and discusses its functional implications in normal and pathological conditions.

This study explores the impacts of Connect Science, a service-learning (SL) program developed to enhance elementary students' energy literacy in the United States. Program impacts were explored within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers in the SL intervention group were provided with professional development, coaching and curricular materials. Each fourth grade class chose an energy problem to address, and designed projects to test out a solution. Teachers in a waitlist control group taught their typical energy unit. Upon completion of the unit, students were asked to write about a problem related to energy production or use and propose a potential solution. Inductive content analysis was used to code 703 student responses (377 from control group and 326 from SL group). The majority of students expressed concerns about wasting or using too much electricity or the use of nonrenewable energy sources. Solutions focused on energy conservation and the use of renewable or clean resources were mentioned most frequently overall. Students in the SL group were significantly more likely to mention environmental impacts of various energy sources and to suggest energy conservation solutions or educating others. Conversely, the control group student responses more often focused on electric circuits or electrical safety. Results from this study suggest the promise of environmental SL programs to advance energy literacy and promote critical thinking about how to address energy problems.

AB  - Power consumption in computational clusters has reached critical levels. High-end cluster performance improves exponentially while the power consumed and heat dissipated increase operational costs and failure rates. Yet, the demand for more powerful machines continues to grow. In this chapter, we motivate the need to reconsider the traditional performance-at-any-cost cluster design approach. We propose designs where power and performance are considered critical constraints. We describe power-aware and low power techniques to reduce the power profiles of parallel applications and mitigate the impact on performance.

AB  - Summary
Attempts to understand psychosis—the experience of profoundly altered perceptions and beliefs—raise questions about how the brain models the world. Standard predictive coding approaches suggest that it does so by minimising mismatches between incoming sensory evidence and predictions. By adjusting predictions, we converge iteratively on a best guess of the nature of the reality. Recent arguments have shown that a modified version of this framework—hybrid predictive coding—provides a better model of how healthy agents make inferences about external reality. We suggest that this more comprehensive model gives us a richer understanding of psychosis compared with standard predictive coding accounts. In this Personal View, we briefly describe the hybrid predictive coding model and show how it offers a more comprehensive account of the phenomenology of delusions, thereby providing a potentially powerful new framework for computational psychiatric approaches to psychosis. We also make suggestions for future work that could be important in formalising this novel perspective.

AB  - Computational approaches are nowadays largely applied in drug discovery projects. Among these, molecular docking is the most used for hit identification against a drug target protein. However, many scientists in the field shed light on the lack of availability and reproducibility of the data obtained from such studies to the whole community. Consequently, sustaining and developing the efforts toward a large and fully transparent sharing of those data could be beneficial for all researchers in drug discovery. The purpose of this article is first to propose guidelines and recommendations on the appropriate way to conduct virtual screening experiments and second to depict the current state of sharing molecular docking data. In conclusion, we have explored and proposed several prospects to enhance data sharing from docking experiment that could be developed in the foreseeable future.
