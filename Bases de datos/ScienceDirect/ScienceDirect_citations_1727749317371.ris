AB  - Recent research targets the low-pressure synthesis of ammonia via a light-initiated catalytic process. Despite the importance of materials selection for photocatalysis, computational efforts to guide candidate materials’ nomination ahead of experiments are lacking. The purpose of this study is to employ computational screening, using density functional theory and molecular simulations, to select and evaluate metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as nitrogen fixation photocatalysts and further deduce correlations for the prediction of MOFs’ electronic properties. First, MOFs with appropriate electronic and structural properties are identified. The top candidates have been examined from the perspective of adsorption, diffusion, and mechanical and chemical stability properties. Four MOFs, Fe2Cl2(BBTA), Fe2(mDOBDC), Zn2(mDOBDC), and Ni-BTP, have been selected based on their band edges, while only Fe2Cl2(BBTA) MOF exhibited a bandgap less than 3 eV. Fe2(mDOBDC) exhibited the highest shear modulus of approximately 31 GPa. In addition, a life cycle assessment of the four MOFs showed that Ni-BTP has the lowest environmental impact. A set of 48 MOFs’ combinations are proposed for heterojunction application to enhance charge carriers’ separation. Intriguingly, we demonstrated the predictability of MOF’s bandgap and edges from MOF’s organic linker bandgap and metal node type (oxidation state and corresponding electronic configuration) for MOF families.

AB  - Urban road traffic dynamics are the product of the behaviours and interactions of thousands, often millions of individuals. Traditionally, models of these phenomena have incorporated simplistic representations of individual behaviour, ensuring the maximisation of simulation scale under given computational constraints. Yet, by simplifying representations of behaviour, the overall predictive capability of the model inevitably reduces. In this work a hybrid agent-based modelling framework is introduced that aims to balance the demands of behavioural realism and computational capacity, integrating a descriptive representation of driver behaviour with a simplified, collective model of traffic flow. The hybridisation of these approaches within an agent-based modelling framework yields a representation of urban traffic flow that is driven by individual behaviour, yet, in reducing the computational intensity of simulated physical interaction, enables the scalable expansion to large numbers of agents. A real-world proof-of-concept case study is presented, demonstrating the application of this approach, and showing the gains in computational efficiency made in utilising this approach against traditional agent-based approaches. The paper concludes in addressing how this model might be extended, and exploring the role hybrid agent-based modelling approaches may hold in the simulation of other complex urban phenomena.

AB  - Imagination affects not only the structure of design ideas at the initial stage but also influences the manifestation of final products. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between Taiwanese design college students’ imaginative capacity and their learning performance in class. On the basis of recent scholarship, the authors proposed several reasonably related factors, which were classified into three aspects: personality traits, learning atmosphere, and imaginative thinking. They then verified and discussed four research questions through a teaching experiment with 63 junior college students in YunTech, Taiwan. To proceed smoothly without significantly changing the current teaching process, the authors developed a set of supplementary teaching material and two sets of questionnaires which they then used in the teaching experiment. The results of the teaching experiment proved and suggested the following points corresponding to the research questions: (1) students’ senior high school backgrounds have an effect on their imaginative capacities; (2) judges from other schools should be invited to join the judgement to ensure fairness and with a broader scope; (3) students’ imaginative capacity indeed has an effect on the grade of their final products in the judgement; (4) teachers can identify students with higher imaginative capacity through the responses to the proposed supplementary teaching materials and questionnaires used in the study's curricula. Furthermore, the supplementary teaching material is conjectured to be able to inspire students’ imaginative capacity.

AB  - The course of socio-cultural transition can neither be aimless nor arbitrary, instead it requires a clear direction. A common goal of social species’ evolution is to move towards an advanced spiritual and conscious state. This study aims to develop a population-based algorithm on the basis of cultural transition goal. In this paper, the socio-cultural model based on a system thought framework could be used to develop a cultural evolution algorithm (CEA). CEA leverage four strategies, each consists of several search methods with similar thinking. Seven benchmark functions are utilized to validate the search performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that all of the four strategies of cultural evolution algorithm have better performance when compared with relevant literatures. Finally, the CEA was then applied to optimize two different reliability engineering problems, a Serial-Parallel System design and a Bridge System design. For the Serial-Parallel System design, the CEA achieved the exact solution with ease, and for the Bridge System design, the solution obtained by the CEA is superior to those from other literatures.

AB  - Chunk decomposition, which requires the mental representation transformation in accordance with behavioral goals, is of vital importance to problem solving and creative thinking. Previous studies have identified that the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex in the cognitive control network selectively activated in response to chunk tightness, however, functional localization strategy may overlook the interaction brain regions. Based on the notion of a global brain network, we proposed that multiple specialized regions have to be interconnected to maintain goal representation during the course of chunk decomposition. Therefore, the present study applied a beta-series correlation method to investigate interregional functional connectivity in the event-related design of chunk decomposition tasks using Chinese characters, which would highlight critical nodes irrespective to chunk tightness. The results reveal a network of functional hubs with highly within or between module connections, including the orbitofrontal cortex, superior/inferior parietal lobule, hippocampus, and thalamus. We speculate that the thalamus integrates information across modular as an integrative hub while the orbitofrontal cortex tracks the mental states of chunk decomposition on a moment-to-moment basis. The superior and inferior parietal lobule collaborate to manipulate the mental representation of chunk decomposition and the hippocampus associates the relationship between elements in the question and solution phase. Furthermore, the tightness of chunks is not only associated with different processors in visual systems but also leads to increased intermodular connections in right superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus. To summary up, the present study first reveals the task-modulated brain network of chunk decomposition in addition to the tightness-related nodes in the frontal and occipital cortex.

AB  - Acquired drug resistance is a major limitation for the successful treatment of cancer. Resistance can emerge due to a variety of reasons including host environmental factors as well as genetic or epigenetic alterations in the cancer cells. Evolutionary theory has contributed to the understanding of the dynamics of resistance mutations in a cancer cell population, the risk of resistance pre-existing before the initiation of therapy, the composition of drug cocktails necessary to prevent the emergence of resistance, and optimum drug administration schedules for patient populations at risk of evolving acquired resistance. Here we review recent advances towards elucidating the evolutionary dynamics of acquired drug resistance and outline how evolutionary thinking can contribute to outstanding questions in the field.

AB  - Typical studies on the history of science, or particularly of biology, have been focused on a particular scientist or book, but this selection has a risk of being arbitrary. To find a more objective way of studying history of biology, we applied a statistical method. First, we downloaded from the PubMed database all available titles and abstracts of 934,807 articles in 32 selected journals from 1965 to 2014, and extracted most frequently used 322 terms by text mining. Clustering of these terms according to the annual frequency of usage resulted in three main clusters: Cluster 1 represented terms that were no longer used frequently, Cluster 3 included terms that became abundantly used recently, and Cluster 2 contained terms constantly used. Three phases were delineated in the history of biology over the past 50 years, with transitions in 1987 and 1997. In contrast with our tacit understanding that “function” is a key notion in biological thinking, the results suggest that function-oriented discourses are a new habit of biologists in the genomic era after 1997, in which biological researches focus on identifying a link between a molecule or a structure with its function. We hypothesize that, in spite of repeated warnings, function-related discourses have a teleological connotation, which is easily misunderstood by general audience and, with emphatic expressions such as “important” and “essential”, fit to the need for justification of researches as part of researcher's responsibility for public funding.

AB  - Introduction
Multifactorial falls risk assessment tools (FRATs) can be an effective falls prevention method for older adults, but are often underutilized by health care professionals (HCPs). This study aims to enhance the use and implementation of multifactorial FRATs by combining behavioral theory with the user-centered design (UCD) method of personas construction. Specifically, the study aimed to (1) construct personas that are based on external (i.e., needs, preferences) and intrinsic user characteristics (i.e., behavioral determinants); and (2) use these insights to inform requirements for optimizing an existing Dutch multifactorial FRAT (i.e., the ‘Valanalyse’).
Methods
Survey data from HCPs (n = 31) was used to construct personas of the ‘Valanalyse.’ To examine differences between clusters on 68 clustering variables, a multivariate cluster analysis technique with non-parametric analyses and computational methods was used. The aggregated external and intrinsic user characteristics of personas were used to inform key design and implementation requirements for the ‘Valanalyse,’ respectively, whereby intrinsic user characteristics were matched with appropriate behavior change techniques to guide implementation.
Results
Significant differences between clusters were observed in 20 clustering variables (e.g., behavioral beliefs, situations for use). These variables were used to construct six personas representing users of each cluster. Together, the six personas helped operationalize four key design requirements (e.g., guide treatment-related decision making) and 14 implementation strategies (e.g., planning coping responses) for optimizing the ‘Valanalyse’ in Dutch geriatric, primary care settings.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that theory- and evidence-based personas that encompass both external and intrinsic user characteristics are a useful method for understanding how the use and implementation of multifactorial FRATs can be optimized with and for HCPs, providing important implications for developers and eHealth interventions with regards to encouraging technology adoption.

We show how coverage of the rankings is subject to shifts in rhetorical strategy as Times Higher Education has developed into a ranking powerhouse. Over time, the magazine has spectacularized higher education by making changes in the rankings newsworthy, and has thereby cemented the company's position as an arbiter, reporter, and consultant in the sector.

We propose a neurobiologically inspired agent implementation that is based on mechanics of chemical and physiological processes within human brain. Implementation of model features simulation of neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline. Demonstration of emotions is achieved via combining aforementioned neuromodulators in different proportions. The Lovheim cube of emotions is used for this purpose. Topic of “uncanny valley” phenomenon and its effect on human-machine interactions is also mentioned. In conclusion of this paper we have proposed realistic computation model allowing us to visualize agents mimics in sync with his speech, and have made a working prototype of aforementioned model.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter shows that a vector space is much more than merely a space of vectors, and that it is straightforward and useful to extend it computationally. The crucial idea here is to make the subspaces of vector space explicit elements of computation. To build the algebra of subspaces, the familiar lines and planes are revisited through the origin. This chapter investigates their geometrical properties carefully and formalizes those by the aid of a new algebraic outer product, which algebraically builds subspaces from vectors. The structure it produces is considered for the Grassmann space of subspaces of a vector space Rn, and defines many terms to describe its features. Throughout this chapter, it considers a real n-dimensional vector space Rn, but has no need for a metric; additionally, it only treats its homogeneous subspaces (i.e., subspaces containing the origin). The chapter starts with an n-dimensional vector space. However, the definition of a vector space in linear algebra is more general than what is needed in this book, being defined over arbitrary fields of scalars. To develop thinking about subspaces, the homogeneous subspaces of a 3-D space are considered.

AB  - We consider inverse problems governed by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that contain uncertain parameters in addition to the parameters being estimated. In such problems, which are common in applications, it is important to understand the sensitivity of the solution of the inverse problem to the uncertain model parameters. It is also of interest to understand the sensitivity of the inverse problem solution to different types of measurements or parameters describing the experimental setup. Hyper-differential sensitivity analysis (HDSA) is a sensitivity analysis approach that provides tools for such tasks. We extend existing HDSA methods by developing methods for quantifying the uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Specifically, we propose a linear approximation to the solution of the inverse problem that allows efficiently approximating the statistical properties of the estimated parameters. We also explore the use of this linear model for approximate global sensitivity analysis. As a driving application, we consider an inverse problem governed by a COVID–19 model. We present comprehensive computational studies that examine the sensitivity of this inverse problem to several uncertain model parameters and different types of measurement data. Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear approximation model for uncertainty quantification in inverse problems and for parameter screening.

AB  - How can we study, characterize, and understand the neural underpinnings of cognitive-emotional behaviors as inherently dynamic processes? In the past 50 years, Stephen Grossberg has developed a research program that embraces the themes of dynamics, decentralized computation, emergence, selection and competition, and autonomy. The present paper discusses how these principles can be heeded by experimental scientists to advance the understanding of the brain basis of behavior. It is suggested that a profitable way forward is to focus on investigating the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly, central research problems involve characterizing “neural trajectories” and the associated geometry of the underlying “neural space.” Finally, it is argued that, at a time when the development of neurotechniques has reached a fever pitch, neuroscience needs to redirect its focus and invest comparable energy in the conceptual and theoretical dimensions of its research endeavor. Otherwise we run the risk of being able to measure “every atom” in the brain in a theoretical vacuum.

AB  - Hazards from the outer space environment either natural (space weather and asteroids) or artificial (space debris and the growing number of satellites launched to orbit) pose a rising risk to space flight activities. The awareness for space sustainability and space safety has seen a continuous increase in recent years and does not stop at the Earth's sphere of influence. The first spacefaring nations start thinking about sustainability in cislunar space and the Martian environment. This work deals with the issue of space debris in Martian orbits in the light of planetary protection. A Mars Sustainability Framework has been developed. This includes a study on the orbital and regulatory environment of Mars, long-term propagation of orbits of artificial objects and the two natural moons, and the analysis of objects evolution and first approaches for collision probability computation. With this work, the issue of space debris beyond Earth orbit is analysed at an early stage.

AB  - The high seismic risk connected to the existing construction heritage requires a wide-scale renovation action to ensure structural resilience and avoid future human and economic losses. Given the urgency and the scale of the problem and the lack of available resources, a new strategy for the renovation of the obsolete European building stock should be envisioned, accounting for both safety and environmental, social and economic sustainability. This research aims at exploring new cost-effective seismic retrofit solutions based on the principles of low-invasiveness and incremental seismic rehabilitation, as envisioned by FEMA P-420 (2009). The incremental rehabilitation approach allows to plan repair and retrofit actions along with the maintenance works expected during the building's lifetime, thereby spreading them in time and reducing costs. In addition, low-invasiveness of the solutions is required to reduce the impacts on the functionality of the building, thus cutting the costs connected to downtime. A possible solution is represented by the introduction of an exoskeleton entirely carried out from outside. In this paper, a new sustainable technique is proposed, where the existing structure is connected to a self-supporting exoskeleton adopting demountable dry techniques, which may be assembled and activated in different phases of the building lifetime. As a proof of concept, the approach is then applied to a school building.

AB  - Reviewing the history of the development of artificial intelligence (AI) clearly reveals that brain science has resulted in breakthroughs in AI, such as deep learning. At present, although the developmental trend in AI and its applications has surpassed expectations, an insurmountable gap remains between AI and human intelligence. It is urgent to establish a bridge between brain science and AI research, including a link from brain science to AI, and a connection from knowing the brain to simulating the brain. The first steps toward this goal are to explore the secrets of brain science by studying new brain-imaging technology; to establish a dynamic connection diagram of the brain; and to integrate neuroscience experiments with theory, models, and statistics. Based on these steps, a new generation of AI theory and methods can be studied, and a subversive model and working mode from machine perception and learning to machine thinking and decision-making can be established. This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of adapting brain science to AI.

KW  - FPV sustainability assessment
AB  - Floatovoltaics is rapidly emerging as a novel type of sustainable energy technology, in which solar photovoltaic installations are sited directly on open-water spaces. As an agro-renewable energy-generation technology, it makes dual use of water to generate revenue from under-utilised irrigation water surfaces while also offering mutually beneficial layers of land-saving, environmental conservation and water-preservation benefits. Standardised metrics for ground-mounted photovoltaic projects, however, do not properly account for the technology’s extended range of resource-use-efficiencies and impact-effect-positives. Such knowledge gaps hinder evidence-based scientific assessments in regulatory project permissions mandated by law. Technology planning and impact assessment practices can benefit from a computer-aided technique to characterise floatovoltaic performance profiles. This paper introduces a conceptual empirical modelling framework, a holistic system dynamics-thinking methodology and a computer synthesis model to empirically predict the performance and sustainability profiles of prospective floatovoltaic installations. By inherently exploring the techno-economic and techno-environmental externalities of floatovoltaic enterprises, it translates performance profiles into sustainability indicators, articulated as WELF-nexus parameters. The paper details the integrated analytical framework, mathematical modelling formulation and digital computer synthesis model towards quantitative floatovoltaic energy system planning and sustainability assessments. The study’s main finding is that an integrated techno-enviro-economic floatovoltaic assessment methodology can be successfully modelled as a context-sensitive synthesis technique in a system dynamics modelling environment. The proposed technique can find utility in solving real-world problems with assessments in efficiency, feasibility and sustainability for agricultural floatovoltaics.

AB  - In the course of our continuing exploration for novel bioactive lead compounds (s) from the species Boswellia, we have recently reported incensole derivatives isolated from Boswellia papyrifera Hochst. Given the known antidepressant-like effects of incensole and incensole acetate, we herein present that the low dose intraperitoneal administration of incensole derivatives, namely, incensfuran and incensone, showed significant antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for their anxiolytic potential in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light dark box (LDB) tests and anticonvulsant effects in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure tests. In the EPM test, administration of these compounds led to dose-dependent increases in open arm entries and in the time spent in EPM open arms. Similar results were obtained in the LDB test, wherein compounds these caused significant increases in the number of transitions between lit and dark compartments and the time spent in the lit compartment. The anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM were not reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil, whereas PTZ and bicuculline (BIC) completely abolished the anxiolytic effects, showing the involvement of the non-benzodiazepine binding sites of GABAA receptors. All four compounds induced significantly elevated brain GABA levels, indicating the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. Additionally, molecular docking was conducted to elucidate the mode of action for the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of these derivatives. Moreover, these compounds also possess drug-like properties and excellent ADMET profiles.

AB  - In the path planning of UAVs, autonomous decision-making and control are challenging tasks in the uncertain 3D environment consisting of static and dynamic obstacles. Hence, the selection of appropriate path-planning approaches is essential. In the proposed work, we have considered the meta-heuristic approaches only for an in-depth review. Metaheuristic approaches have been remarkably known for solving complex problems, optimal solutions, and lesser computational complexity compared to deterministic approaches that produce an inefficient solution. An in-depth review has been made by considering the approaches used for path planning, their advantages, disadvantages, applications, the type of time domain (offline or online), type of environment (simulation or real time), hybridization with other approaches, single or multiple UAV system, and obstacle handled (static or dynamic). It is observed that current meta-heuristic methods face constraints like inadequate convergence rates, entrapment in local optima, and complex operations, necessitating continuous development of novel approaches. Implementation of path-planning approaches are very much limited to simulation study over experimental analysis. Hybrid algorithms emerge as a potential solution for tackling these hurdles and optimizing UAV navigation, particularly in dynamic environments involving multiple UAVs. The paper highlights key research gaps, trends, along with prospects in the field of research.

AB  - Humans have needs motivating their behavior according to intensity and context. However, we also create preferences associated with each action’s perceived pleasure, which is susceptible to changes over time. This makes decision-making more complex, requiring learning to balance needs and preferences according to the context. To understand how this process works and enable the development of robots with a motivational-based learning model, we computationally model a motivation theory proposed by Hull. In this model, the agent (an abstraction of a mobile robot) is motivated to keep itself in a state of homeostasis. We introduced hedonic dimensions to explore the impact of preferences on decision-making and employed reinforcement learning to train our motivated-based agents. In our experiments, we deploy three agents with distinct energy decay rates, simulating different metabolic rates, within two diverse environments. We investigate the influence of these conditions on their strategies, movement patterns, and overall behavior. The findings reveal that agents excel at learning more effective strategies when the environment allows for choices that align with their metabolic requirements. Furthermore, we observe that incorporating pleasure as a component of the motivational mechanism affects behavior learning, particularly for agents with regular metabolisms depending on the environment. Our study also unveils that, when confronted with survival challenges, agents prioritize immediate needs over pleasure and equilibrium. These insights shed light on how robotic agents can adapt and make informed decisions in demanding scenarios, demonstrating the intricate interplay between motivation, pleasure, and environmental context in autonomous systems.

AB  - Criticality is the singular state of complex systems poised at the brink of a phase transition between order and randomness. Such systems display remarkable information-processing capabilities, evoking the compelling hypothesis that the brain may itself be critical. This foundational idea is now drawing renewed interest thanks to high-density data and converging cross-disciplinary knowledge. Together, these lines of inquiry have shed light on the intimate link between criticality, computation, and cognition. Here, we review these emerging trends in criticality neuroscience, highlighting new data pertaining to the edge of chaos and near-criticality, and making a case for the distance to criticality as a useful metric for probing cognitive states and mental illness. This unfolding progress in the field contributes to establishing criticality theory as a powerful mechanistic framework for studying emergent function and its efficiency in both biological and artificial neural networks.

AB  - Algorithms for data assimilation try to predict the most likely state of a dynamical system by combining information from observations and prior models. Variational approaches, such as the weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation formulation considered in this paper, can ultimately be interpreted as a minimization problem. One of the main challenges of such a formulation is the solution of large linear systems of equations which arise within the inner linear step of the adopted nonlinear solver. Depending on the selected approach, these linear algebraic problems amount to either a saddle point linear system or a symmetric positive definite (SPD) one. Both formulations can be solved by means of a Krylov method, like GMRES or CG, that needs to be preconditioned to ensure fast convergence in terms of the number of iterations. In this paper we illustrate novel, efficient preconditioning operators which involve the solution of certain Stein matrix equations. In addition to achieving better computational performance, the latter machinery allows us to derive tighter bounds for the eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned linear system for certain problem settings. A panel of diverse numerical results displays the effectiveness of the proposed methodology compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - In the paper, a novel self-learning energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) to achieve the hydrogen saving and maintain the battery operation. In the EMS, it is proposed to approximate the EMS policy function with fuzzy inference system (FIS) and learn the policy parameters through policy gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL). Thus, a so-called Fuzzy REINFORCE algorithm is first proposed and studied for EMS problem in the paper. Fuzzy REINFORCE is a model-free method that the EMS agent can learn itself through interactions with environment, which makes it independent of model accuracy, prior knowledge, and expert experience. Meanwhile, to stabilize the training process, a fuzzy baseline function is adopted to approximate the value function based on FIS without affecting the policy gradient direction. Moreover, the drawbacks of traditional reinforcement learning such as high computation burden, long convergence time, can also be overcome. The effectiveness of the proposed methods were verified by Hardware-in-Loop experiments. The adaptability of the proposed method to the changes of driving conditions and system states is also verified.

AB  - The cryosphere is a broadly defined term associated with areas where water is in solid form. Thus, cryospheric geomorphology, in theory, should include polar and mountain regions, the arctic, ice, sea ice, glaciers, rock glaciers, snow, permafrost, ice shelves and icebergs, karst-glacial interactions, and even planetary cryosphere. No book can completely justify including all these areas/topics. In this treatise on geomorphology, the focus is primarily on conventional and applied glacial geomorphology and periglacial geomorphology with a rich history and promising future. Glacial geomorphology, for example, rose to prominence in debate surrounding the theory of Ice Ages. Detailed descriptions and novel measurements of processes and landforms and now high-end computing facilities led to sophisticated process-form modeling. Current emphases include interactions between glacial and other processes in development of mountain belts, natural hazards, hydrological interplay, and responses to climate change. Periglacial geomorphology begins with Walery von Lozinski and the IGS Spitzbergen excursion, 1910–11, followed by it becoming a descriptive branch of European-dominated climatic geomorphology with a growing emphasis on quantitative studies by the 1960s. More recently, the emergence of geocryology, cold-regions engineering, and sophisticated Quaternary studies is dominating many aspects of basic and applied periglacial geomorphology. The advent of high-resolution satellite and drone images, digital elevation models, and machine learning and large-scale data computational techniques are now leading the discovery process for cryospheric geomorphology.

AB  - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an increasingly significant source of information for healthcare professionals and researchers. Two technical challenges are addressed: motivating federated learning members to contribute their time and effort, and ensuring accurate aggregation of the global model by the centralized federated learning server. To overcome these issues and establish a decentralized solution, the integration of blockchain and federated learning proves effective, offering enhanced security and privacy for smart healthcare. The proposed approach includes a gamified element to incentivize and recognize contributions from federated learning members. This research work offers a solution involving resource management within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) using a newly proposed trust decentralized loop federated learning consensus blockchain. The obtained raw data is pre-processed by using handling missing values and adaptive min-max normalization. The appropriate features are selected with the aid of hybrid weighted-leader exponential distribution optimization algorithm. Because, data with multiple features exhibits varying levels of variation across each feature. The selected features are then forwarded to the training phase through the proposed pyramid squeeze attention generative adversarial networks to classify the EHR as positive and negative. The proposed classification model demonstrates high flexibility and scalability, making it applicable to a wide range of network architectures for various computer vision tasks. The introduced model provides better outcomes in terms of 98.5% in the training accuracy and 99% in the validation accuracy over Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, which is more efficient than the other traditional methods.

AB  - Stress alters decision-making by usually promoting risk-taking and reward-seeking, which could be advantageous in a context where risk is rewarded, such as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). However, previous studies addressing this issue showed inconsistencies which could emerge from assessing decision-making as a single dimension. Our aim is to study through computational modelling how stress influences cognitive subprocesses of the decision-making during the BART. For this purpose, 94 healthy participants were submitted to BART, but only half were exposed to the virtual Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR). The Experimental-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model was used to gain insight into the subprocesses involved in risk-taking during BART. Rather than reward-seeking, our results showed a pessimistic prior belief about the balloons bursting likelihood, and a lower risk preference in the stressed participants. This cautious attitude could be attributable to an alertness state promoted by stress. Yet, since risk is rewarded in BART, it could also evidence a maladaptive decision-making derived from learning difficulties and altered feedback-processing under stress.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of individual social-cognitive propensity in the processing of nontransparent sentential meaning, exemplified by the morpho-syntactically unsupported iterative meaning in “The frog hopped for five minutes.” Results of our speeded questionnaire in Mandarin Chinese showed that social cognitive propensity of typically-developed individuals, indexed by autistic-like traits, significantly correlated with online response times (RTs) of naturalness rating, while the effect was absent in offline rating scores. Individuals with higher autistic-like traits (i.e., lower social skills) took longer to process sentences with nontransparent meaning for making judgments. We argue that the computation of these sentences involves meaning contextualization—construing a coherent conceptual representation by integrating multiple lexical representations and evaluating sentential-discourse context. Such context-dependent meaning processing requires sufficient context sensitivity, which varies across individuals in association with social cognitive propensity. The pattern is captured by the Dual-Process Approach to information processing and social cognition: individuals with higher autistic-like traits are prone to deliberative reasoning with lower contextual sensitivity. This cognitive bias leads to greater cost when the full comprehension demands meaning contextualization, and therefore longer RTs in evaluating appropriate interpretations. The findings show that individual variability in social cognitive propensity modulates the online computation of nontransparent sentential meaning.

AB  - Background:
Traditional therapist-based rehabilitation training for patients with movement impairment is laborious and expensive. In order to reduce the cost and improve the treatment effect of rehabilitation, many methods based on human–computer interaction (HCI) technology have been proposed, such as robot-assisted therapy and functional electrical stimulation (FES). However, due to the lack of active participation of brain, these methods have limited effects on the promotion of damaged nerve remodeling.
New method:
Based on the neurofeedback training provided by the combination of brain–computer interface (BCI) and exoskeleton, this paper proposes a multimodal brain-controlled active rehabilitation system to help improve limb function. The joint control mode of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and motor imagery (MI) is adopted to achieve self-paced control and thus maximize the degree of brain involvement, and a requirement selection function based on SSVEP design is added to facilitate communication with aphasia patients.
Comparison with existing methods:
In addition, the Transformer is introduced as the MI decoder in the asynchronous online BCI to improve the global perception of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and maintain the sensitivity and efficiency of the system.
Results:
In two multi-task online experiments for left hand, right hand, foot and idle states, subject achieves 91.25% and 92.50% best accuracy, respectively.
Conclusion:
Compared with previous studies, this paper aims to establish a high-performance and low-latency brain-controlled rehabilitation system, and provide an independent and autonomous control mode of the brain, so as to improve the effect of neural remodeling. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through offline and online experiments.

AB  - Over sixty percent of AIS courses cover Excel because it is an important tool for accounting students to learn and master. Although spreadsheet programs like Excel provide powerful analytical tools for business, in practice, they are often created and used by people with minimal programming experience. Consequently, users can often develop spreadsheets containing critical errors, which, in turn, can cause significant losses for their businesses. Errors can be reduced, however, by learning and employing good spreadsheet design techniques. Good spreadsheet design also makes it easier to update and continue to use a spreadsheet over time. This paper describes a method for teaching spreadsheet design where students complete three spreadsheet assignments in an iterative and repetitive process. By the time students have completed these assignments, they will have acquired good spreadsheet design skills and improved their basic Excel skills.

AB  - A generic intelligent fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategy is proposed in this study to simulate the actual diagnostic thinking of chiller experts. A three-layer Diagnostic Bayesian Network (DBN) is developed to diagnose chiller faults based on the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) theory. The structure of the DBN is a graphical and qualitative illustration of the intrinsic causal relationships among causal factors in Layer 1, faults in Layer 2 and fault symptoms in Layer 3. The parameters of the DBN represent the quantitative probabilistic relationships among the three layers. To diagnose chiller faults, posterior probabilities of the faults under observed evidences are calculated based on the probability analysis and the graph theory. Compared with other FDD strategies, the proposed strategy can make use of more useful information of the chiller concerned and expert knowledge. It is effective and efficient in diagnosing faults based on uncertain, incomplete and conflicting information. Evaluation of the strategy was made on a 90-ton water-cooled centrifugal chiller reported in ASHRAE RP-1043.

AB  - The investigation monitored the digital game-playing behaviours of 428 primary-aged students (aged 10–12 years). Chi-square analysis revealed that boys tend to spend more time playing digital games than girls while boys and girls play quite different game genres. Subsequent analysis revealed statistically significant gender differences in terms of the types of mathematics-rich games students prefer to play. Girls preferred to play games that required problem solving, quantitative computations and the interpretation of graphs. Boys preferred games that required visual/spatial engagement. Given the fact that boys outperform girls on spatial tasks and mathematics assessment items that contain graphics, this study has implications for the development of students' mathematics sense making.

AB  - The ability to construct concepts is indispensable to both individual and evolutionary development. Our model involves the use of ambiguous stimuli to facilitate decision-making by promoting analogical reasoning. Toward this end, we have developed Web-based exercises in word categorization for the purpose of engaging participants in analogical reasoning that contributes to the integration of words and leads to the construction of new concepts. 12 graduate students and 20 junior high school students were presented with ambiguous information for the purpose of comparison between the senior and the junior students. We hypothesized that the senior students tend to behave with more insight rather than junior students with less activation of thought process. Our results suggested that the presentation of the ambiguous stimuli were associated with unique thought processes, which are consistent with approaches to word categorization that reflect either the experience of insight or the operation of a trial and error strategy, depending on the junior or the senior students. We showed that the senior students tend to be more like insight into categorization design, while the junior as rather try and error behavior, in consideration of needed time and actions in analogical thinking.

AB  - The science of AI is concerned with the study of intelligent forms of behaviour in computational terms. But what does it tell us when a good semblance of a behaviour can be achieved using cheap tricks that seem to have little to do with what we intuitively imagine intelligence to be? Are these intuitions wrong, and is intelligence really just a bag of tricks? Or are the philosophers right, and is a behavioural understanding of intelligence simply too weak? I think both of these are wrong. I suggest in the context of question-answering that what matters when it comes to the science of AI is not a good semblance of intelligent behaviour at all, but the behaviour itself, what it depends on, and how it can be achieved. I go on to discuss two major hurdles that I believe will need to be cleared.

AB  - Adversarial examples, which add carefully planned perturbations to images, pose a serious threat to neural network applications. Transferable adversarial attacks, in which adversarial examples generated on the source model can successfully attack the target model, provide a realistic and undetectable method. Existing transfer-based attacks tend to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by destroying their intrinsic features. They destabilized features differentially by assessing their importance, thus rendering the model incapable of inference. However, the existing methods generate feature-importance assessments that are overly dependent on the source model, leading to inaccurate importance guidance and insufficient feature destruction. In this paper, we propose neighborhood expectancy attribution attacks (NEAA) that accurately guide the destruction of deep features, leading to highly transferable adversarial examples. First, we design a highly versatile attribution tool called neighborhood attribution to represent the importance of features that attribute highly similar results to various source models. Specifically, we discard the imputation of a single baseline and adopt the imputed expectation of a baseline within the neighborhood of the image. Subsequently, we generalize the neighborhood attribution to the middle layer of the model and simplify the computation by assuming linear independence. Finally, the attribution result guides the attack to destroy the intrinsic features of the image and obtain highly transferable adversarial examples. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at Github: https://github.com/KWPCCC/NEAA.

AB  - The Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction system is famous because it can generate self-organized patterns, also known as “chemical waves”. Pattern formation out of an initially homogeneous system is seemingly violating the 2nd-law of thermodynamics (order is produced out of disorder), while in fact, the BZ reaction is an open, far-from thermodynamic equilibrium system, where instability is the cause of morphogenesis and Hopf bifurcation of the reaction kinetics can generate self-oscillatory state trajectories. In this paper, the evolution of the BZ reaction in a two dimensional diffusion system is studied by the numerical computation methods, for the purpose of reconstructing the chemical wave patterns. The similarity of the chemical waves to many complex systems in biology, ecology and engineering makes current study potentially significant. With the study of the pattern formation, we hope provide some thoughts on complex system theory, thermodynamics of the self-oscillatory reaction system, and numerical computation methods on complex patterns, etc.

AB  - This work evaluates large-scale hydrogen production processes - those capable of providing hydrogen for an eventual automotive hydrogen program in a community and along highways - with the aim to Sidentify which of the production processes of hydrogen is more attractive for an eventual automotive hydrogen program. To perform the research, the MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by the Category-Based Assessment Technique) method and the computational code M-MACBETH 3.2.0 are used taking into account multiple criteria. Thus, this work used the computational code M-MACBETH 3.2.0 to evaluate twelve hydrogen production processes and build rankings of attractiveness of hydrogen production processes, considering the following criteria: economic (invested capital and production cost), technical (the purity of the hydrogen produced) and environmental (the amount of energy used to produce 1 kg of hydrogen and the CO2 emissions to produce 1 kg of hydrogen). In the end, three rankings are produced considering three scenarios, which allow to conclude that: if decisions regarding hydrogen are made taking into account that economic and financial aspects have the same weight as sustainability aspects, the more attractive hydrogen plants are those that use the Solar Thermochemical Plants; if decisions are made taking into account that economic and financial aspects are more important than aspects of sustainability, the production process more attractive will be the one that uses the SR technology - Ethanol and Natural Gas Steam Reforming; and that Solar Thermochemical Plants becomes more attractive than all others alternatives when, in decision-making, sustainability environmental aspects prevail over economic and financial aspects.

We also present the extension of original “cube of emotion” with the bridge to computational processes parameters. The neurosimulation is done via re-implementation of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) subsystems of a rat brain to replicate 8 basic psycho-emotional states according to the “cube of emotion”. Results of neu-rosimulations indicate the incremental influence of DA and NA over computational resources of a psycho-emotional state while 5-HT decreases the computational resources used to calculate a psycho-emotional state. This way we indicate the feasibility of the bio-plausible re-implementation of psycho-emotional states in a computational system. This approach could be useful extension of decision making and load balancing components of modern artificial agents as well as intelligent robotic systems.

AB  - This article considers how aquatic systems modelling has changed since 1995 and how it must change in future if we are to continue to advance. A distinction is made between mechanistic and statistical models, and the relative merits of each are considered. The question of “when do aquatic systems models provide accurate and useful predictions?” is addressed, implying some guidelines for model development. It is proposed that, in general, ecological models only provide management-relevant predictions of the behaviour of real systems when there are strong physical (as opposed to chemical or ecological) drivers. Developments over the past 15 years have included changes in technology, changes in the modelling community and changes in the context in which modelling is conducted: the implications of each are briefly discussed. Current trends include increased uptake of best practice guidelines, increasing integration of models, operationalisation, data assimilation, development of improved tools for skill assessment, and application of models to new management questions and in new social contexts. Deeper merging of statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches through such techniques as Bayesian Melding, Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and surrogate modelling is identified as a key emerging area. Finally, it is suggested that there is a need to systematically identify areas in which our current models are inadequate. We do not yet know for which categories of problems well-implemented aquatic systems models can (or cannot) be expected to accurately predict observational data and system behaviour. This can be addressed through better modelling and publishing practices.

AB  - Moral judgment involves much more than computations of the expected consequences of behavior. A prime example of the complexity of moral thinking is the frequently replicated finding that violations by omission are judged less morally wrong than violations by commission, holding intentions constant. Here we test a novel hypothesis: Omissions are judged less harshly because they produce little material evidence of wrongdoing. Evidence is crucial because moral accusations are potentially very costly unless supported by others. In our experiments, the omission effect was eliminated when physical evidence showed that an omission was chosen. Perpetrators who “opted out” by pressing a button that would clearly have no causal effects on the victim, rather than rescuing them, were judged as harshly as perpetrators who directly caused death. These results show that, to reduce condemnation, omissions must not only be noncausal, they must also leave little or no material evidence that a choice was made.

AB  - Change detection (CD) is the main way to detect changes in the Earth’s surface features in a timely and accurate manner and to understand the interactions between humans and nature, CD is also an important scientific tool for supporting decision-making. Many convolution-based methods and Transformer-based methods have gained remarkable success in the field of CD with high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) due to their powerful feature extraction capability and global information modeling capability, respectively. However, the diversity and complexity of HRSIs render CD methods constantly challenging, e.g., off-nadir angle imaging, seasonal turnover, and simultaneous changes in multiple feature types. Common convolution-based or Transformer-based encoding–decoding networks have a single way of data modeling and a low degree of feature fusion, resulting in poor applicability to different remote sensing data, poor recognition of different semantic targets, and limited accuracy. To improve the generalizability and detection accuracy of the network, we developed a composite higher-order attention network with multiple encoding paths named MCHA-Net. MCHA-Net has four encoding backbones, namely, the Siamese-learning path, Residual-learning path, and Transformer-learning path. Different encoding ways are equivalent to different thinking ends, and the integration can make the network have a stronger feature representation capability, forming a local–global-cross domain data modeling approach and making the network have powerful data sensing and mining capability. The decoding end aggregates the semantic information of each layer and integrates them into a unified linearized feature mapping module to achieve full modeling of the separability of information in the target domain. In addition, we propose a new higher-order attention mechanism to perform adaptive feature refinement for each layer of each encoding end, to guide the network in focusing on the targeted region and to guarantee the boundary integrity and internal compactness of the detection results. Moreover, we design a hierarchical network supervision schema that adds supervision signals at different feature abstraction levels to impose differentiated soft constraints on each layer of the network, ensuring high semantic consistency of features across layers and facilitating fast network fitting. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (S2Looking, SVCD, and SYSU-CD) and one transfer application dataset (Google Dataset) show that MCHA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation, and exhibits strong generalization and robustness against few-shot learning.

AB  - The concept-cognitive learning (CCL) process is the specific implementation step of simulating the human brain to learn concepts, and the CCL model is its core carrier. Different CCL models constructed by different cognitive minds will produce different concept learning results. The existing CCL model based on sufficient and necessary granule approximations regards the human's approximation idea in the face of inconsistent information as a logical criterion, and aims at finding the closest concept pair of the clue as concept learning results with a certain learning accuracy. However, the existing CCL method based on sufficient and necessary granule approximations cannot guarantee that the clue must be between its lower approximation and upper approximation, which causes the fact that the learning accuracy may not effectively measure the consistency of concept learning results. What is more, although the computational process obeys logical cognitive condition, the concept learning results may not conform to the actual situation, such as the case of merely generating full concepts and empty concepts. For the first problem, we improve the learning accuracy of the existing CCL method, propose a new CCL method with learning accuracy under hybrid lattice structure, and develop CCL algorithms for the cases of objects and attributes as clues. Moreover, experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed CCL method with learning accuracy under hybrid lattice structure. For the second problem, we put forward a CCL method based on non-logical associative mechanism to handle the unreasonable situation where the concept learning results are full concepts and empty concepts. Finally, two associative CCL algorithms are explored, and experiments are conducted to show their effectiveness.

AB  - Many have argued that the expressive power of human thought comes from language. Language plays this role, so the argument goes, because its generative computations construct hierarchically structured, abstract representations, covering virtually any content and communicated in linguistic expressions. However, language is not the only domain to implement generative computations and abstract representations, and linguistic communication is not the only medium of expression. Mathematics, morality, and music are three others. These similarities are not, we argue, accidental. Rather, we suggest they derive from a common computational system that we call the Universal Generative Faculty or UGF. UGF is, at its core, a suite of contentless generative procedures that interface with different domains of knowledge to create contentful expressions in thought and action. The representational signatures of different domains are organized and synthesized by UGF into a global system of thought. What was once considered the language of thought is, on our view, the more specific operation of UGF and its interfaces to different conceptual domains. This view of the mind changes the conversation about domain-specificity, evolution, and development. On domain-specificity, we suggest that if UGF provides the generative engine for different domains of human knowledge, then the specificity of a given domain (e.g., language, mathematics, music, morality) is restricted to its repository of primitive representations and to its interfaces with UGF. Evolutionarily, some generative computations are shared with other animals (e.g., combinatorics), both for recognition-learning and generation-production, whereas others are uniquely human (e.g., recursion); in some cases, the cross-species parallels may be restricted to recognition-learning, with no observable evidence of generation-production. Further, many of the differences observed between humans and other animals, as well as among nonhuman animals, are the result of differences in the interfaces: whereas humans promiscuously traverse (consciously and unconsciously) interface conditions so as to combine and analogize concepts across many domains, nonhuman animals are far more limited, often restricted to a specific domain as well as a specific sensory modality within the domain. Developmentally, the UGF perspective may help explain why the generative powers of different domains appear at different stages of development. In particular, because UGF must interface with domain-specific representations, which develop on different time scales, the generative power of some domains may mature more slowly (e.g., mathematics) than others (e.g., language). This explanation may also contribute to a deeper understanding of cross-cultural differences among human populations, especially cases where the generative power of a domain appears absent (e.g., cultures with only a few count words). This essay provides an introduction to these ideas, including a discussion of implications and applications for evolutionary biology, human cognitive development, cross-cultural variation, and artificial intelligence.

We explore the utility of bioengineered human tissues—individually or connected into physiological units—for biological research. While much smaller and simpler than their native counterparts, these tissues are complex enough to approximate distinct tissue phenotypes: molecular, structural, and functional. Unlike organoids, which form spontaneously and recapitulate development, “organs-on-a-chip” are engineered to display some specific functions of whole organs. Looking back, we discuss the key developments of this emerging technology. Thinking forward, we focus on the challenges faced to fully establish, validate, and utilize the fidelity of these models for biological research.

AB  - Critical thinking about ethics in neuroscience can be a powerful force in enabling research and translating results meaningfully for society. This chapter provides four examples of such an empowered approach to neuroscience. The authors discuss how upfront consideration of the societal implications of advances in neuroscience can shape the use of animal models. They situate ethical thinking in this era of big science and big data, reflecting on strategies for sharing databases while protecting contributors and users. They highlight how collaboration among neuroscientists, ethicists, and others can produce positive measures to resolve the problem of incidental discoveries in brain imaging research, as one example of debates on incidental findings more broadly. The mandate of neuroscience research as public service and ethical imperative is addressed by describing opportunities for neuroscientists to engage with societal issues emerging from their research, and how this deepens the discourse and adds value to the research enterprise.

AB  - The classical inventory models solely rely on accurate estimate of the back order cost, with a view to establish economic order quantity (EOQ) that must be placed by a customer. Recognizing and quantifying the adverse effects of loss of customer goodwill owing to the inability of a raw material or product supplier organisation to meet customer demands should not only focus on direct penalty cost computation, but should also incorporate change in customers’ future demand owing to this backordering phenomenon. A lot of classical and mathematical approaches focused on the computation of the back order penalty cost coefficient; which gives an organisation a clue of the customer disappointment index, and not the estimated back order cost required for EOQ computation. In light of this, this paper proposes an approach that could be utilized to accurately compute the back order penalty cost of an organisation. The approach considers: (i) the number of times backordering phenomenon have occurred in an organisation, (ii) the decision a customer takes when backordering occur once or couple of times during the ordering phases of an organisation and (iii) myriads of penalties that a customer bestow on a raw material or product supplier organisation for backordering its order, to establish the backorder cost of this organisation. The approach proposed in this study serve as a useful information to suppliers in ascertaining the raw material backorder cost based on their customer responses to backordering, with a view to ensure sustainable raw material supply.

To analyze the evidence available in the literature on the pedagogical practices developed with children through hospital classes.
Method
An integrative review was conducted on July 20, 2022, in Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ERIC, Educ@, and Scielo using the following descriptors in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, extracted from DECS/MeSH, CINAHL, Brased/INEP, and ERIC Thesaurus: “Child, Hospitalized”, “Education, Special”, “Education Department, Hospital”, “Hospital Classroom”, “Hospital Class”, “Child Rearing”, “Educational Practices”, “Early Childhood Education”, “Education”, “Hospital Pedagogy”, and “Hospital Special Class”. No time restriction was applied. The EndNot Web reference manager and the Rayyan software were used to select studies, and later, the methodological rigor and level of evidence were assessed.
Results
The 22 articles described pedagogical practices, including ludic activities, individualized work, working with regular school content, stimulation activities, pedagogical and dialogic listening, learning based on the exchange of knowledge, video games, computational robotics, and theatrical performance.
Conclusion
Although difficulties were identified in implementing pedagogical practices in the hospital, they were shown to allow educational continuity and clinical improvement of hospitalized children.
Implications for practice
Studies on the educational process within the hospital setting can contribute to the development of public policies and the guarantee of the right to education for hospitalized children.

KW  - Bayesian optimization
KW  - grey-box modeling

AB  - Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the global optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. One of the main advantages of BO is its use of Gaussian processes (GPs) to characterize model uncertainty which can be leveraged to guide the learning and search processes. However, BO typically treats systems as black-boxes and this limits the ability to exploit structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections). Composite functions of the form f(x,y(x)), wherein GP modeling is shifted from the performance function f to an intermediate function y, offer an avenue for exploiting structural knowledge. However, the use of composite functions in a BO framework is complicated by the need to generate a probability density for f from the Gaussian density of y calculated by the GP (e.g., when f is nonlinear it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression). Previous work has handled this issue using sampling techniques; these are easy to implement and flexible but are computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm which allows for the efficient use of composite functions in BO; this uses adaptive linearizations of f to obtain closed-form expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that this simple approach (which we call BOIS) enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. Using a chemical process optimization case study, we benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and sampling approaches. Our results indicate that BOIS achieves performance gains and accurately captures the statistics of composite functions.

AB  - Susan Carey’s account of Quinean bootstrapping has been heavily criticized. While it purports to explain how important new concepts are learned, many commentators complain that it is unclear just what bootstrapping is supposed to be or how it is supposed to work. Others allege that bootstrapping falls prey to the circularity challenge: it cannot explain how new concepts are learned without presupposing that learners already have those very concepts. Drawing on discussions of concept learning from the philosophical literature, this article develops a detailed interpretation of bootstrapping that can answer the circularity challenge. The key to this interpretation is the recognition of computational constraints, both internal and external to the mind, which can endow empty symbols with new conceptual roles and thus new contents.

AB  - Background/Objective
A growing population of those affected by serious illness, prognostic uncertainty, patient diversity, and healthcare digitalization pose challenges for the future of serious illness communication. Yet, there is paucity of evidence to support serious illness communication behaviors among clinicians. Herein, we propose three methodological innovations to advance the basic science of serious illness communication.
Results
First, advanced computation techniques – e.g. machine-learning techniques and natural language processing – offer the possibility to measure the characteristics and complex patterns of audible serious illness communication in large datasets. Second, immersive technologies – e.g., virtual- and augmented reality – allow for experimentally manipulating and testing the effects of specific communication strategies, and interactional and environmental aspects of serious illness communication. Third, digital-health technologies – e.g., shared notes and videoconferences – can be used to unobtrusively observe and manipulate communication, and compare in-person to digitally-mediated communication elements and effects. Immersive and digital health technologies allow integration of physiological measurement (e.g. synchrony or gaze) that may advance our understanding of patient experience.
Conclusion/practice implications
New technologies and measurement approaches, while imperfect, will help advance our understanding of the epidemiology and quality of serious illness communication in an evolving healthcare environment.

AB  - Reverse supply chain management is a significant issue for sustainable economy, product recovery and green thinking. The purpose of this study is to contribute product recovery management by designing open loop reverse supply chain network. The main difference between open loop and closed loop reverse supply chain is in returning of used products. In a closed loop reverse supply chain, used products are generally returned to original producers. But in an open loop reverse supply chain, used products are not returned to original producers, outsider firms recover them. This paper presents a mathematical model for multi stage and multi period reverse supply chain network, which maximizes total profit of the network. The proposed model determines facility locations and material flows between stages in each period. Numerical experiments showed the applicability and efficiency of the model.

AB  - The paper presents a technical introduction to psychological theories of emotions. It highlights a usable idea implemented in a number of recently developed computational systems of emotions, and the hypothesis that emotion can play the role of a scheduling variable in controlling autonomous robots. In the main part of this study, we outline our own computational system of emotion – xEmotion – designed as a key structural element in the developed target device, being an Intelligent System of Decision-making (ISD) for autonomous and robotic units. The ISD system has a cognitive architecture based on the principles of human psychology. The main purpose of building such a system is to prepare a framework for autonomous units used in system engineering (Kowalczuk and Czubenko, 2011; Czubenko et al., 2015). In particular, ISD is based on the concepts of cognitive psychology (in information processing) and motivation theory, which includes the system of needs (for decision-making). The xEmotion subsystem, however, focuses on modeling an alternative approach based on emotion. The xEmotion implementation covers aspects of somatic, appraisal and evolutionary theories of emotions using fuzzy sets. In this article, we also illustrate the core emotional behavior of the ISD system using simulation. The first application is a user interface for identifying emotions and predicting human behavior. The second is an eSailor simulation, which illustrates the possible behavior of the xEmotion subsystem. The last is an xDriver simulation experiment, which is to prove the validity of the concept of using emotion-based systems, according to the SVC principle. In summary, we also discuss other possible applications of the xEmotion system.

AB  - The complex background of disease images and the small contrast between the disease area and the background easily confuse, seriously affecting the robustness and accuracy of kiwifruit disease identification models. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a disease identification model based on Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, ConvViT(Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer), to identify diseases by extracting effective features of kiwifruit disease spots. The proposed ConvViT includes convolutional structure and Transformer structure: The convolutional structure is used to extract the global features of the image, and the Transformer structure is used to obtain the local features of the disease area to help the CNN see better. Meanwhile, the paper designs different models according to the number of parameters and FLOPs (floating-point operations) to improve the model's scalability. The model variants of different sizes are designed to be lightweight to run on devices with different resource constraints. We achieved 98.78% identification accuracy on the self-built kiwifruit disease dataset, with up to 4.53% improvement in identification accuracy compared to the same level of Resnet, ViT, and ResMLP, and more than 10% reduction in the number of parameters and FLOPs. Experimental results on the PlantVillage dataset and the AI Challenger 2018 also show that ConvViT has good generalizability, indicating that the proposed model can solve kiwifruit disease identification problems in complex environments and be valuable a backbone network for other identification tasks with practical applications.

AB  - Two experiments examined whether different task ecologies influenced insight problem solving. The 17 animals problem was employed, a pure insight problem. Its initial formulation encourages the application of a direct arithmetic solution, but its solution requires the spatial arrangement of sets involving some degree of overlap. Participants were randomly allocated to either a tablet condition where they could use a stylus and an electronic tablet to sketch a solution or a model building condition where participants were given material with which to build enclosures and figurines. In both experiments, participants were much more likely to develop a working solution in the model building condition. The difference in performance elicited by different task ecologies was unrelated to individual differences in working memory, actively open-minded thinking, or need for cognition (Experiment 1), although individual differences in creativity were correlated with problem solving success in Experiment 2. The discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the prevailing metatheoretical commitment to methodological individualism that places the individual as the ontological locus of cognition.

AB  - From birth, infants are exposed to a wealth of information from their surroundings. This makes early categorization abilities especially important for infants and children to process information and come to understand the world around them. As a result of several sophisticated experimental paradigms, it is well-established that early categorization abilities become refined over the developmental trajectory. Researchers have identified a global-to-basic shift in early categorical thinking, such that preverbal infants discriminate between global-level categories (i.e., dogs, cats, chairs, tables, etc.) before basic-level categories (i.e., different breeds of cats and dogs). However, differences in the literature regarding the timing of this shift emerge depending on the paradigm used to measure categorization. There is evidence to suggest that infants also use dynamic, causal, and functional information to guide their object categorization and discrimination. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the research and theory on early categorization and concept development.

To this aim, I first review the assumptions of sensemaking and decision-making streams of research, especially the influence of bounded rationality, affective states and their relationships with cognition; then, I integrate them on the common basis of socially situated cognition. This new theory emphasizes the role of affective states in determining/being determined by cognition and its errors, pointing out decision makers’ affect as the result of multi-level adaptations to the physical and social environment. Management decisions are path dependent but not immutable; they, indeed, bank on the predominant feeling resulting from the modifying interactions and regulations of decision makers with their physical and social environment. Here, decision makers are proposed as “emotional cognizers” overcoming the thinking-feeling dichotomy that has often featured in the study of management decisions. This theory is beneficial for behavioral strategy, offering the needed assumptions to intertwine human cognition, emotions, and social behavior.

AB  - In the fab, semiconductor manufacturers often use deep learning approaches for chip contour detection to shorten automated optical inspection to minimize the loss of production costs and lower power consumption in chip contour detection for realizing energy-efficient computing. However, YOLOv5 and GSEH-YOLOv5 models have sacrificed their accuracy to improve the operational speed. MobileNetv3-YOLOv5 model can enhance the accuracy but lacks high-speed operation. Therefore, this study presents a light version of MobileNetv3-YOLOv5 model with ghost convolution, abbreviated LWMG-YOLOv5, to speed up chip contour detection because this architecture can reduce the number of model parameters and computational burden at the same time. As a result, the proposed approach can outperform the other methods by getting a 3.62% speed-up in chip contour detection to gain a better manufacturing advantage in increasing the chip yields by 1.7% and reducing the loss of production costs by 1.83% significantly.

AB  - The C2─C6/Diels‐Alder cyclization of enyne‐ketoene 1 was studied by experiments, theoretical calculations, and dynamic trajectory computations. The failure to trap possible intermediate(s), indicates a concerted reaction mechanism. A detailed search for stationary points revealed a concerted mechanism and surprisingly a diradical intermediate with no direct connection to the enyne‐ketoene 1. To probe the accessibility of this intermediate quasiclassical trajectories were initiated from the concerted transition state structure. Notably, 36% of the trajectories reach the product zone directly and 5% arrive at the product via the intermediate diradical. Additionally, 31% of the trajectories go to the intermediate zone and stay there within the simulation time limit.

AB  - Ocean environmental surveys typically involve multi-area coverage path planning tasks. The most important problem is improving the coverage efficiency of the task. A new path planning method based on Successful History-Based Adaptive Differential Evolution variants with Linear population size reduction(L-SHADE) is presented to solve this problem. The method comprises two parts: the part of sub area coverage path planning and the part of finding the optimized sequence of sub area start points. The key idea is establishing the relationship between the starting point of each sub area and the optimized multi-area path. We implement the method through numbering the possible starting point of sub area path and proposing a computing formula. In addition, the results of L-SHADE mutation process are optimized which make L-SHADE possible to apply in multi-area coverage path planning. This method avoids area discretization and exponential growth of computational quantities, and it is suitable for complex areas as well as multi-area. The simulation results with MATLAB showed the improvement of coverage path planning task execution efficiency. Compared with the method thinking of the sub area as the center of it, our method reduced the multi-area coverage path length by 4%–7%. From the simulations and analysis, we concluded that the method is able to improve the efficiency and stability of multi-area coverage path planning.

The teaching materials were mainly delivered via a hands-on APP. The authors conducted an empirical study as well as pre-tests and post-tests for a total of 118 sophomore students majoring in engineering at two Universities. Outcomes found that the progressive reasoning teaching materials designed for this course were helpful in improving student creativity and scientific reasoning. Significant improvements were also achieved in product design, technical methods, and technological ideas aspects of technological creativity and every scientific reasoning skill, with the exception of proportional reasoning. Results also identified strong correlation between technical creativity and scientific reasoning. This relationship may be further investigated in follow-up studies. This study also proposed recommendations for coordinating designs of digital teaching materials in other engineering courses with the development of student thinking.

AB  - Music and architecture have made use of mathematical proportions throughout the history for the purpose of creating acoustic and visual forms. The reason for this is the aesthetic pursuit of both disciplines since centuries. Mathematics is one of the most important factors that influence aesthetic results. While forming their abstract aesthetic compositions the musicians use the musical notes that have definite frequency values. Each of these frequency values are defined by one integer. Every classical music artist uses the fractal sequencing of these frequencies. On the other hand we encounter hundreds of silent formats which are produced using mathematical ideas. In this context if we think of the interdisciplinary interaction between music and architecture no form is ever silent. In this study, the intersection of two disciplines will be examined in the perspective of architecture; a stumper and interrogative start for pursuit of architectural forms of the present day with the transformation of auditory forms to visual forms will be made; and a basis will be provided to be able to discuss the innovations that the spaces, structures and auditory experiences which can be formed by obtaining musical codes bring.

KW  - Googlization of health
AB  - Big tech companies increasingly play a role in the domain of health. Also called the “Googlization of Health”, this phenomenon is often studied by drawing on the notion of ‘hostile worlds’, where market values and common goods are incommensurable. Yet, the ‘hostile worlds’ theory is not uncontested; scholars for instance argue that the justifications of big tech companies are important analytical considerations as well. Building on this literature, in this paper I report on a case study of Facebook employing AI for suicide prevention, moving beyond Facebook's justifications only to study the ways in which media commentators and their audiences discussed Facebook's programme and the values they saw as being at stake. In the results, I show how invasiveness was, in different ways and forms, a main theme in thinking about Facebook using AI to do suicide prevention. Commentators and readers alike discussed how: 1) Facebook takes corporate responsibility with this initiative, or alternatively Facebook only has commercial interests and uses the notion of ‘public good’ to transgress spheres and sectors even further, thus being invasive; 2) Facebook's AI suicide prevention programme is invasive in relation to privacy and privacy laws, or, instead, people give up their privacy willingly in exchange for entertainment; 3) The programme undermines, rather than enhances, safety; 4) Suicide prevention in itself is already invasive. These different forms of invasiveness, I argue in the conclusion, also imply responsibility for different actors, from AI itself to Facebook through to medical professionals. Moreover, they show what values are at stake in, and transformed through, Facebook's AI suicide prevention programme, going beyond the frames of privacy and surveillance capitalism.

The development of these methods is associated with the thought process behind their use, both in the context of reductionist research as well as in the context of systems and computational biology. The concepts, advantages, and disadvantages of Big Data are discussed and contrasted with those of dynamic mechanistic modeling. Clinically translational applications of data-driven and statistical methods in the context of critical illness are presented and discussed as a gateway to true mechanistic modeling.

AB  - Theories of cognitive development are reviewed, beginning with pioneering theories by Piaget and Vygotsky. Neo-Piagetian theories which integrated Piagetian theory with other conceptions of cognition were developed by McLaughlin, Pascual-Leone, Case, Fischer, and Chapman. Complexity theories propose that children become capable of dealing with more complex relations as they develop. Information processing theories, neural net theories, dynamic systems theories, and theories of reasoning processes all provide models of the reasoning processes employed by children at different ages. Microgenetic analysis methods are used to study the processes of transition from one level of thinking to the next.

AB  - Existing convolution techniques in artificial neural networks suffer from huge computation complexity, while the biological neural network works in a much more powerful yet efficient way. Inspired by the biological plasticity of dendritic topology and synaptic strength, our method, Learnable Heterogeneous Convolution, realizes joint learning of kernel shape and weights, which unifies existing handcrafted convolution techniques in a data-driven way. A model based on our method can converge with structural sparse weights and then be accelerated by devices of high parallelism. In the experiments, our method either reduces VGG16/19 and ResNet34/50 computation by nearly 5× on CIFAR10 and 2× on ImageNet without harming the performance, where the weights are compressed by 10× and 4× respectively; or improves the accuracy by up to 1.0% on CIFAR10 and 0.5% on ImageNet with slightly higher efficiency. The code will be available on www.github.com/Genera1Z/LearnableHeterogeneousConvolution.

Qualitative analysis is applied to data gathered in four focus groups with teens, three semi-structured interviews with adults who facilitate maker spaces, and six observation sessions. Outcomes include a rich description of critical thinking in the context of technology practice, and secondly, a set of eight activation questions that serve as a tool kit to encourage reflection and scaffold mindful and critical practices in community-based maker spaces for youth. Results from this study support the development of nstruments and practices to support mindful making and critical technical practice in maker spaces for youth.

AB  - Background
Skills required for thoracoscopic and robotic operations likely differ. The needs and abilities of trainees learning these approaches require assessment.
Methods
Trainees performed initial components of minimally invasive lobectomies using thoracoscopic or robotic approaches. Component difficulty was scored by trainees using the NASA task load index (NASATLX). Performance of each component was graded by trainees and attending surgeons on a 5-point ordinal scale (naïve, beginning learner, advanced learner, competent, master).
Results
Eleven surgical trainees performed 87 replications among three lobectomy components (divide pulmonary ligament; dissect level 7/8/9 nodes; dissect level 4/5 nodes). Before performance NASATLX scores did not differ among components or between surgical approaches. Trainees' after performance NASATLX scores appropriately calibrated task load for the components. After performance NASATLX scores were significantly lower for thoracoscopy than before performance estimates; robotic scores were similar before surgery and after performance. Task load was higher for robotic than for thoracoscopic approaches. Trainees rated their performance higher than did attending surgeons in domains of knowledge and thinking, but ratings for other domains were similarly low. Ratings for performance improved significantly as component performance repetitions increased.
Conclusions
Trainees did not differentiate task load among components or surgical approaches before attempting them. Task load scores differentiated difficulty among initial components of lobectomy, and were greater for robotic than for thoracoscopic approaches. Trainees overestimated their level of cognitive performance compared with attending physician evaluation of trainee performance. The study provides insights into how to customize training for thoracoscopic and robotic lobectomy and identifies tools to assess training effectiveness.

AB  - The paper is devoted to studying the stability of complex systems, which include diversified and heterogeneous elements. In order to analyze the stability of such systems, it is proposed to develop the process of dynamic determination of the main factors. For this purpose, this paper uses a variant of cognitive modeling based on the concept of “influence”. The proposed approach implies, in a sense, a broader view of the concept of the “fuzzy cognitive map” introduced by B. Kosko. “Influence” does not mean “causality”, allows a broader interpretation range, and is calculated in a special way that makes it possible to prove rigorous theorems. A complex system is represented as a digraph, and the selection of the main factors is proposed to be based on the concept of “influence”, which is introduced as follows. All nodes of the graph are assigned an abstract property “significance”, which allows you to compare heterogeneous factors, and a particular computational procedure is introduced that allows this “significance” to be calculated. The “influence” of factors on each other is defined as a mathematically formalized response in accordance with the introduced computational procedure of the “significance” of the studied factor to the variation in the “significance” of input factors. For example, the analysis of the sustainability of a large-scale model of the Russian economy in terms of the strength of the “influence” is provided.

AB  - This paper proposes an analysis of the different model construction and development approaches in the context of urban goods movement (UGM). We focus on the model development issues more than on the mathematical tools applied in these models. First, we explore the main UGM models in the field, identifying their main construction schemas and their features limits. From this analysis, we propose a classification of UGM modeling frameworks, synthesizing them on a table that illustrates their construction schemas. Second, we analyze their limits and find a first set of synergies between the different thinking schools. This analysis allows us to highlight the strong points and override their weaknesses, and to propose a set of recommendations for planners and modeling schools in order to find co-operative schemas that improve the models’ efficiency.

AB  - The paper is motivated by the need of to address a new the old topic of operational research and hard (but also soft) systems science: what is the role of mathematical modelling, how does it relate to knowledge, to creativity, to human concerns? Such a need arises because of the great change observed today, of informational revolution, of transition towards knowledge-based economy, towards networked organization of our social and economic life. During last 50years operational research, mathematical modelling and computerised techniques of model analysis and optimisation contributed essentially to the change of perception of contemporary world, characteristic for the current informational revolution indicating the change of civilisation eras. These contributions have been noted during these years inside operational research, but analysed mostly from so-called soft systems thinking perspective. Main contributions to the actual formation of the new era, however, came from the hard systems research, in particular, as we shall show, from mathematical modelling in applications to the development of technological systems. The new civilisation era of information and knowledge-based economy started around 1980. It is a long duration historical era, characterised by a new way of understanding the world. This understanding is systemic and chaotic; in particular, it assumes the emergence of qualitatively new properties of complex systems on higher layers of complexity, which cannot be reduced to the properties of system components. On this background, it is necessary to reflect a new on the theory of knowledge. The paper presents a discussion of the concept of knowledge from several perspectives, such as the perspective of operational research, of systems science, of mathematical modelling, of knowledge-based economy, of knowledge engineering and knowledge management, of interactive model-based decision support. The human-centred development of informational technology necessitates a re-appraisal of soft systems approaches; their values and limitations are discussed. Additionally, a rational theory of intuition is recalled to show its relation with the concept of tacit knowledge, of knowledge creation and with harmonious approaches to knowledge characterising Far East philosophy as well as Japanese approaches to knowledge management and creation. Epistemological conclusions from the rational theory of intuition are discussed, including a new concept of micro-theories of knowledge creation and the concept of Creative Space.

AB  - Addiction is a complex biopsychosocial phenomenon, impacted by biological predispositions, psychological processes, and the social environment. Using mathematical and computational models that allow for surrogative reasoning may be a promising avenue for gaining a deeper understanding of this complex behavior. This paper reviews and classifies a selection of formal models of addiction focusing on the intra- and inter-individual dynamics, i.e., (neuro) psychological models and social models. We find that these modeling approaches to addiction are too disjoint and argue that in order to unravel the complexities of biopsychosocial processes of addiction, models should integrate intra- and inter-individual factors.

AB  - Socio-technical systems (STS) analysis has provided us with a powerful framework with which to analyse the reasons behind the poor acceptability, uptake and performance of many information or communication technology systems (ICT). However, for the contribution of STS thinking to be more than simply a means of critiquing current practices and ICT systems, it needs to also contribute to the process of developing new and more effective ICT systems. Specifically, we need to develop a formal design language for translating our insights about the socio-technical nature of work, into design specifications that result in better interventions in the work place. We need to get ‘technical’ about what we mean and about what we want from a design, and we need to work alongside technologists to shape technology, as well as the processes, organisations and cultures within which they will be embedded. Indeed the process of design itself can be seen as a socio-technical one, and understanding the decision to design itself may allow us one day to stop designing for people, and create STS that sustainably design themselves.

AB  - It is often said that there are two types of psychological processes: one that is intentional, controllable, conscious, and inefficient, and another that is unintentional, uncontrollable, unconscious, and efficient. Yet, there have been persistent and increasing objections to this widely influential dual-process typology. Critics point out that the ‘two types’ framework lacks empirical support, contradicts well-established findings, and is internally incoherent. Moreover, the untested and untenable assumption that psychological phenomena can be partitioned into two types, we argue, has the consequence of systematically thwarting scientific progress. It is time that we as a field come to terms with these issues. In short, the dual-process typology is a convenient and seductive myth, and we think cognitive science can do better.

AB  - Background
Cognitive distortion is a central feature of depression, encompassing negative thinking, dysfunctional personality styles and dysfunctional attitudes. It has been hypothesized that ACEs could increase the vulnerability to depression by contributing to the development of a stable negative cognitive style. Nevertheless, little research has been carried out on possible associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and cognitive distortion, and whether any gender differences exist.
Aim
The aim of this study was to examine the association between ACEs and cognitive distortions and possible differences between genders in a sample of patients affected by bipolar disorder.
Method
130 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) (46 men and 84 females), completed the Risky Family Questionnaire to assess ACEs and the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ) to assess cognitive distortions.
Results
A positive association was found between ACE and the CQ total score. Investigating the 5 dimensions assessed through the CQ, only the dimension “generalization across situations” was significantly associated to ACE. An interaction between ACE and gender was found for “generalization across situations”, while no differential effect among females and males was found for CQ total score.
Conclusion
This is the first study to report a relationship between negative past experiences and depressive cognitive distortions in subjects affected by BD. Growing in a family environment affected by harsh parenting seems to a cognitive vulnerability to depression; this effect is especially strong in females.

These principles are mostly, but not entirely mathematical. Because the evolutionary process tends to optimize, the computations performed by these mechanisms tend to approximate the optimal computation. This doctrine does not imply that animals always make rational and/or optimal choices.

AB  - Background
Taxonomy has long struggled with analysing vast amounts of phenotypic data due to computational and accessibility challenges. Ontology-based technologies provide a framework for modelling semantic phenotypes that are understandable by computers and compliant with FAIR principles. In this paper, we explore the use of Phenoscript, an emerging language designed for creating semantic phenotypes, to produce computable species descriptions. Our case study centers on the application of this approach to dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeinae).
New information
We illustrate the effectiveness of Phenoscript for creating semantic phenotypes. We also demonstrate the ability of the Phenospy python package to automatically translate Phenoscript descriptions into natural language (NL), which eliminates the need for writing traditional NL descriptions. We introduce a computational pipeline that streamlines the generation of semantic descriptions and their conversion to NL. To demonstrate the power of the semantic approach, we apply simple semantic queries to the generated phenotypic descriptions. This paper addresses the current challenges in crafting semantic species descriptions and outlines the path towards future improvements. Furthermore, we discuss the promising integration of semantic phenotypes and nanopublications, as emerging methods for sharing scientific information. Overall, our study highlights the pivotal role of ontology-based technologies in modernising taxonomy and aligning it with the evolving landscape of big data analysis and FAIR principles.

If an expert is not sure to select one term, weakened hedges would be a natural way to express the uncertainty. This is usually implemented by using a hedge to modify the most possible term, like the expression “more or less good”. To model the uncertainty implied by hedges in QDM, this paper presents a novel linguistic representational and computational model in which the linguistic expressions take the form of a weakened hedge and a linguistic term, which is named as linguistic term with weakened hedge (LTWH). The syntax of LTWHs is defined by a set of hedges and a set of linguistic terms. The semantics of a LTWH is determined, objectively, based on the semantics of the term and a similarity measure of the reference domain. Accordingly, the negation, order relations and some basic operations of LTWHs are defined. To illustrate the effectiveness of LTWHs in granular computing, the connection to some multi-granularity linguistic models is exploited and a process for unifying multi-granularity linguistic information is developed. The major contritions of this paper are: (1) The proposed model enables a new manner to express and operate uncertain linguistic information in QDM; (2) it possesses clear syntax and semantics and the computational results are very interpretable; and (3) the proposed solution of multi-granularity linguistic unification maintains the semantics of the original linguistic information.

AB  - Despite a growing focus on individual differences in cognitive psychology, research in this area is complicated by several issues related to how such differences are defined and measured. These challenges create a significant roadblock for the field. To combat this issue, we argue that the next critical step for language and cognitive science is careful and thorough investigation of the specific mechanisms that drive individual differences. In this chapter, our goal is to extend the process-based mechanistic functional normativist framework and to provide a test case for how researchers can leverage computational modeling to investigate individual differences in cognitive mechanisms (using pattern learning in the serial reaction time task as an example). By shifting our focus to characterizing the mechanisms that drive individual differences in language and cognition, the field stands to advance both theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches for studying these processes.

AB  - This paper discusses the process of proving from a novel theoretical perspective, imported from cognitive psychology research. This perspective highlights the role of hypothetical thinking, mental representations and working memory capacity in proving, in particular the effortful mechanism of cognitive decoupling: problem solvers need to form in their working memory two closely related models of the problem situation – the so-called primary and secondary representations – and to keep the two models decoupled, that is, keep the first fixed while performing various transformations on the second, while constantly struggling to protect the primary representation from being “contaminated” by the secondary one. We first illustrate the framework by analyzing a common scenario of introducing complex numbers to college-level students. The main part of the paper consists of re-analyzing, from the perspective of cognitive decoupling, previously published data of students searching for a non-trivial proof of a theorem in geometry. We suggest alternative (or additional) explanations for some well-documented phenomena, such as the appearance of cycles in repeated proving attempts, and the use of multiple drawings.

AB  - This article represents an effort to help PhD students in computer science and engineering to generate good original ideas for their PhD research. Our effort is motivated by the fact that most PhD programs nowadays include several courses, as well as the research component, that should result in journal publications and the PhD thesis, all in a timeframe of 3–6 years. In order to help PhD students in computing disciplines to get focused on generating ideas and finding appropriate subject for their PhD research, we have analyzed some state-of-the-art inventions in the area of computing, as well as the PhD thesis research of faculty members of our department, and came up with a proposal of 10 methods that could be implemented to derive new ideas, based on the existing body of knowledge in the research field. This systematic approach provides guidance for PhD students, in order to improve their efficiency and reduce the dropout rate, especially in the area of computing.

AB  - Product design is a highly involved, often ill-defined, complex and iterative process, and the needs and specifications of the required artifact get more refined only as the design process moves toward its goal. An effective computer support tool that helps the designer make better-informed decisions requires efficient knowledge representation schemes. In today’s world, there is a virtual explosion in the amount of raw data available to the designer, and knowledge representation is critical in order to sift through this data and make sense of it. In addition, the need to stay competitive has shrunk product development time through the use of simultaneous and collaborative design processes, which depend on effective transfer of knowledge between teams. Finally, the awareness that decisions made early in the design process have a higher impact in terms of energy, cost, and sustainability, has resulted in the need to project knowledge typically required in the later stages of design to the earlier stages. Research in design rationale systems, product families, systems engineering, and ontology engineering has sought to capture knowledge from earlier product design decisions, from the breakdown of product functions and associated physical features, and from customer requirements and feedback reports. VR (Virtual reality) systems and multidisciplinary modeling have enabled the simulation of scenarios in the manufacture, assembly, and use of the product. This has helped capture vital knowledge from these stages of the product life and use it in design validation and testing. While there have been considerable and significant developments in knowledge capture and representation in product design, it is useful to sometimes review our position in the area, study the evolution of research in product design, and from past and current trends, try and foresee future developments. The goal of this paper is thus to review both our understanding of the field and the support tools that exist for the purpose, and identify the trends and possible directions research can evolve in the future.

AB  - The persistence of information communicated between humans is difficult to measure as it is affected by many features. This paper presents an approach to computationally model the cognitive processes of information sharing to describe persistence or extinction of communication in Twitter over time. The adaptive mental network model explains, for example, how an individual can experience information overflow on a topic, and how this affects the sharing of information. Parameter tuning by Simulated Annealing is used to identify characteristics of the network model that fit to empirical data from Twitter. The data collected is related to the independentism in Catalunya, Spain, which is considered a global issue with repercussion in Europe.

AB  - The performance of parallel algorithms is often inconsistent with their preliminary theoretical analyses. Indeed, the difference is increasing between the ability to theoretically predict the performance of a parallel algorithm and the results measured in practice. This is mainly due to the accelerated development of advanced parallel architectures, whereas there is still no agreed model for parallel computation, which has implications for the design of parallel algorithms and for the manner in which parallel programming should be taught. In this study, we examined the practical performance of Cormen’s Quicksort parallel algorithm. We determined the performance of the algorithm with different parallel programming approaches and examine the capacity of theoretical performance analyses of the algorithm for predicting the actual performance. This algorithm is used for teaching theoretical and practical aspects of parallel programming to undergraduate students. We considered the pedagogic implications that may arise when the algorithm is used as a learning resource for teaching parallel programming.

AB  - This book is intended to be an introduction to various applications of computational toxicology and to show how these approaches are currently being used effectively for risk assessment purposes in the near term. It is important to note that the field of computational toxicology is rapidly evolving and that subsequent editions of this book will take up new methods that are currently under development, such as high-throughput screening, and others that are still in a conceptual stage. There are many advantages for including computational toxicology approaches in the risk assessment process. Among these are reducing costs, minimizing use of animals in toxicology testing, improving speed in providing answers regarding chemicals in emergency situations such as the Gulf Oil spill, and dealing with the common problem of decision making for chemical mixtures. In addition, computational methods may be used for extrapolating or translating data from both in vitro and in vivo experimental animal test systems for human risk assessments of chemicals and drugs. In addition, computational methods may be used for focusing laboratory studies into productive areas by data mining the published literature and developing testable hypotheses by application of systems biology approaches to identify chemical interactions with functional molecular pathways to generate a more comprehensive picture of likely primary and secondary modes of chemical or drug activity. In summary, there is much that computational toxicology is now contributing to helping make better societal risk assessment decisions about chemicals and drugs. The future for these approaches is optimistic and limited only by human ingenuity and availability of resources.

AB  - This fMRI study investigated brain activation during creative idea generation using a novel approach allowing spontaneous self-paced generation and expression of ideas. Specifically, we addressed the fundamental question of what brain processes are relevant for the generation of genuinely new creative ideas, in contrast to the mere recollection of old ideas from memory. In general, creative idea generation (i.e., divergent thinking) was associated with extended activations in the left prefrontal cortex and the right medial temporal lobe, and with deactivation of the right temporoparietal junction. The generation of new ideas, as opposed to the retrieval of old ideas, was associated with stronger activation in the left inferior parietal cortex which is known to be involved in mental simulation, imagining, and future thought. Moreover, brain activation in the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus was found to increase as a function of the creativity (i.e., originality and appropriateness) of ideas pointing to the role of executive processes for overcoming dominant but uncreative responses. We conclude that the process of idea generation can be generally understood as a state of focused internally-directed attention involving controlled semantic retrieval. Moreover, left inferior parietal cortex and left prefrontal regions may subserve the flexible integration of previous knowledge for the construction of new and creative ideas.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the demand for personal protective equipment, in particular face masks, thus leading to a huge amount of healthcare waste generated worldwide. Consequently, such an unprecedented amount of newly emerged waste has posed significant challenges to practitioners, policy-makers, and municipal authorities involved in waste management (WM) systems. This research aims at mapping the COVID-19-related scientific production to date in the field of WM. In this vein, the performance indicators of the target literature were analyzed and discussed through conducting a bibliometric analysis. The conceptual structure of COVID-19-related WM research, including seven main research themes, were uncovered and visualized through a text mining analysis as follows: (1) household and food waste, (2) personnel safety and training for waste handling, (3) sustainability and circular economy, (4) personal protective equipment and plastic waste, (5) healthcare waste management practices, (6) wastewater management, and (7) COVID-19 transmission through infectious waste. Finally, a research agenda for WM practices and activities in the post-COVID-19 era was proposed, focusing on the following three identified research gaps: (i) developing a systemic framework to properly manage the pandemic crisis implications for WM practices as a whole, following a systems thinking approach, (ii) building a circular economy model encompassing all activities from the design stage to the implementation stage, and (iii) proposing incentives to effectively involve informal sectors and local capacity in decentralizing municipal waste management, with a specific focus on developing and less-developed countries.

AB  - Words such as cognition, motivation and emotion powerfully guide theory development and the overall aims and goals of behavioral neuroscience research. Once such concepts are accepted generally as natural aspects of the brain, their influence can be pervasive and long lasting. Importantly, the choice of conceptual terms used to describe and study mental/neural functions can also constrain research by forcing the results into seemingly useful ‘conceptual’ categories that have no discrete reality in the brain. Since the popularly named ‘cognitive revolution’ in psychological science came to fruition in the early 1970s, the term cognitive or cognition has been perhaps the most widely used conceptual term in behavioral neuroscience. These terms, similar to other conceptual terms, have potential value if utilized appropriately. We argue that recently the term cognition has been both overused and misused. This has led to problems in developing a usable shared definition for the term and to promotion of possible misdirections in research within behavioral neuroscience. In addition, we argue that cognitive-guided research influenced primarily by top-down (cortical toward subcortical) perspectives without concurrent non-cognitive modes of bottom-up developmental thinking, could hinder progress in the search for new treatments and medications for psychiatric illnesses and neurobehavioral disorders. Overall, linkages of animal research insights to human psychology may be better served by bottom-up (subcortical to cortical) affective and motivational ‘state-control’ perspectives, simply because the lower networks of the brain are foundational for the construction of higher ‘information-processing’ aspects of mind. Moving forward, rapidly expanding new techniques and creative methods in neuroscience along with more accurate brain concepts, may help guide the development of new therapeutics and hopefully more accurate ways to describe and explain brain-behavior relationships.

AB  - Thermoelectric (TE) technology and radiative sky cooling (RSC) technology have proven to be a promising and green way to harvest energy from the environment. Combining RSC technology with Thermoelectric generator (TEG) device for passive power generation at night is meaningful and remains a challenge. Here, a radiative sky cooling driving thermoelectric generator (RSC-TE) system integrated by a doped modified TiO2/PMMA radiative cooling film, a commercial TEG, and an aluminum heat sink is developed, with a simple structure, low cost and high efficiency. The thermal-electrical performance of the RSC-TE system was evaluated through a consecutive nighttime experiment. Experimental results show that the temperature of the cold side of the TEG in contact with the radiative cooler is 2.7–4.2 °C lower than the ambient temperature, and the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of TEG is 2.3–3.2 °C. The temperature difference at 00:00 can reach 2.5 °C, which corresponds to an open circuit voltage of 87 mV. Furthermore, a 3D model has been established by COMSOL software to investigate the effects of different environmental parameters and component-related parameters on system performance, which has guiding significance for the improvement and optimization of the experimental setup. This study can provide a new thinking and some practical guidelines for the design and application of the RSC-TE system.

AB  - An approach to the construction of a computational model in which information processes are presented in the framework of theories without types, and they, in turn, are considered as special parts of typed theories, is proposed. Similar mixing was used in model studies for lambda-calculus. In contrast to them, in the present work, information processes correspond to parameterized metadata objects, which are variable domain constructs. Transformations of variable domains correspond to the spread of the process. Directional transformation provides the generation of metadata targets in the form of parameterized concepts. This simulates the evolving of the process, which allows the interpretation of the hidden time factor. The emerging model is purely process-based and provides a conceptual framework. The possibility of coding this framework with a system of interdependent lambda-terms is shown.

AB  - To tackle the globally increasing discrepancy between food, energy and water demands and resource availability sustainably, resource supply system models have to incorporate the inter-dependencies and -connectivities to other supply systems. This leads naturally to a food–energy–water nexus (FEWN) approach. The FEWN can be interpreted as the study of the connections between the food, energy and water resource systems, emphasizing how decision-making influences the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs among the various sectors. In recent years, modeling and optimization of FEWN systems has been receiving an increasing interest in the open literature, however, with limited emphasis on how decisions of the FEWN are derived. In this review, FEWN optimization studies are analyzed with focus on the employed objectives, optimization and solution strategies, as well as the selected sub-systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales to uncover in detail how decision-making is facilitated. More specifically, FEWN optimization studies are classified according to their modeling and solution strategies. Based on this classification it is uncovered that (i) the decision-making itself has not yet been investigated in detail in FEWN literature, (ii) the incorporation of all aspects of the FEWN is still a challenge, (iii) the interconnection between FEWN systems and society has to be further investigated, and (iv) the implications of uncertainty for the resiliency, robustness and security of process systems is not yet well defined. Additionally, a generic FEWN resource-task network formulation is introduced to illustrate the similarities across the various resource supply sectors. Special interest is placed on how synergies are identified and competition be avoided among resource systems. It is shown that the selected spatial scale as well as the utilized modeling and optimization strategies significantly influence the synergy level of obtained solutions. Furthermore, it is derived that the energy transition has to incorporate FEWN systems thinking for sustainable solution generation. Overall, this review summarizes the different applications and implications of process systems engineering concepts to FEWN systems.

AB  - The philosophy of science should accommodate itself to the facts of human existence, using all aspects of human experience to adapt more effectively, as individuals, species, and global ecosystem. This has several implications: (1) Our nature as sentient beings interacting with other sentient beings requires the use of phenomenological methods to investigate consciousness. (2) Our embodied, situated, purposeful physical interactions with the world are the foundation of scientific understanding. (3) Aristotle's four causes are essential for understanding living systems and, in particular, the final cause aids understanding the role of humankind, and especially science, in the global ecosystem. (4) In order to fulfill this role well, scientists need to employ the full panoply of human faculties. These include the consciousness faculties (thinking, sensation, feeling, intuition), and therefore, as advocated by many famous scientists, we should cultivate our aesthetic sense, emotions, imagination, and intuition. Our unconscious faculties include archetypal structures common to all humans, which can guide scientific discovery. By striving to engage the whole of human nature, science will fulfill better its function for humans and the global ecosystem.

AB  - To address the key problems in the application of intelligent technology in geothermal development, smart application scenarios for geothermal development are constructed. The research status and existing challenges of intelligent technology in each scenario are analyzed, and the construction scheme of smart geothermal field system is proposed. The smart geothermal field is an organic integration of geothermal development engineering and advanced technologies such as the artificial intelligence. At present, the technology of smart geothermal field is still in the exploratory stage. It has been tested for application in scenarios such as intelligent characterization of geothermal reservoirs, dynamic intelligent simulation of geothermal reservoirs, intelligent optimization of development schemes and smart management of geothermal development. However, it still faces many problems, including the high computational cost, difficult real-time response, multiple solutions and strong model dependence, difficult real-time optimization of dynamic multi-constraints, and deep integration of multi-source data. The construction scheme of smart geothermal field system is proposed, which consists of modules including the full database, intelligent characterization, intelligent simulation and intelligent optimization control. The connection between modules is established through the data transmission and the model interaction. In the next stage, it is necessary to focus on the basic theories and key technologies in each module of the smart geothermal field system, to accelerate the lifecycle intelligent transformation of the geothermal development and utilization, and to promote the intelligent, stable, long-term, optimal and safe production of geothermal resources.

AB  - Much research on calculus students’ understanding of applied derivatives has been done in kinematics-based contexts (i.e. position, velocity, acceleration). However, given the wide range of applications in science and engineering that are not based on kinematics, nor even explicitly on time, it is important to know how students understand applied derivatives in non-kinematics contexts. In this study, interviews with six students and surveys with 38 students were used to explore students’ “ways of understanding” and “ways of thinking” regarding applied, non-kinematics derivatives. In particular, six categories of ways of understanding emerged from the data as having been shared by a substantial portion of the students in this study: (1) covariation, (2) invoking time, (3) other symbols as constants, (4) other symbols as implicit functions, (5) implicit differentiation, and (6) output values as amounts instead of rates of change.
