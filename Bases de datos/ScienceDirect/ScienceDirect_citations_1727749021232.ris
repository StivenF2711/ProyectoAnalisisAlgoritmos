AB  - With the advent of the Internet and the progressive development and consolidation of a wide range of web standards and technologies as well as the advances in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI), namely the multi agent system concept, new opportunities have emerged for conceiving, modelling and enhancing shop floor's performance and response. Modern IT-supported production paradigms denote a common concept where the shop floor is a lively entity composed by interacting intelligent modules whose individual and collective function adapts and evolves ensuring the fitness and adequacy of the organization, owning the system, in tackling profitable but volatile business opportunities. The self-organizing and peer to peer nature of these systems renders a collective behaviour and dynamics that are fundamentally new. Conventional diagnostic methods and tools have not been designed targeting the envisioned systems therefore lack the required support. In this paper the emerging IT-based production paradigms are surveyed as well as the existing diagnostic methods whose adequacy is analysed. The resulting requirements and characteristics are exposed to stress the need for rethinking current diagnostic practices in future automation systems.

AB  - From a brain processing perspective, the perception of creative thinking is rooted in the underlying cognitive process, which facilitates exploring and cultivating novel avenues and problem-solving strategies. However, it is challenging to emulate the intricate complexity of how the human brain presents a novel way to uncover unique solutions. One potential approach to mitigating this complexity is incorporating creative cognition into the evolving artificial intelligence systems and associated neural models. Hopfield neural network (HNN) are commonly acknowledged as a simplified neural model, renowned for their biological plausibility to store and retrieve information, specifically patterns of neurons. Our findings suggest utilizing modern HNN to emulate creative thinking by making meaningful associations between seemingly disparate concepts. This semantic link is represented as a radio knob that can be set to determine whether the network solves problems creatively or shuts down; the threshold is a parameter. We used the term "first knob of creativity" to describe a certain pattern and utilized the "second knob of creativity" to aid in the examination of alternatives within the network. By manipulating the knobs, it is possible to selectively suppress specific patterns, facilitating the creative functioning of the HNN and identifying other patterns with which input can be linked.

AB  - The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has the potential to bring about a revolutionary transformation in transportation through its influence on human behavior and interactions between users and vehicles. However, interoperability challenges between retailer organizations and manufacturers present a barrier to decision-making processes and impact the human-centric nature of the IoV. Ethical dilemmas arise as a result of the IoV’s inability to prevent accidents, particularly in critical situations. This study aims to enhance the IoV’s effectiveness by carefully selecting and improving essential attributes from various data sources, including sensors, GPS, 5G or 6G communication networks, and real-time data provisioning. To achieve the aim of the proposed study, a Multi-criterion Decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, which allows for the analysis and selection of optimal choices while taking into account various quantitative and qualitative factors. Despite the challenges posed by complex models and ambiguous data, MCDM remains an indispensable technique for aligning transportation systems with current expectations. The CRITIC and TOPSIS MCDM-enabled methodologies are employed to analyze IoV architecture, prioritizing significant elements that impact system performance and identifying optimal solutions by considering complications from worst-case scenarios. The study will assist engineers, scientists, and organizations to develop smart IoV systems that will cater to human needs by improving mobility and inspiration among users.

Perhaps the most controversial and rare aspect of the halogen bonding interaction is the potential of fluorine in compounds to serve as a halogen bond donor. In this note, we provide clear and convincing examples of hypothetical molecules in which fluorine is strongly halogen bonding in a metastable state.

AB  - The presence of complementary information across multiple sensory or motor modalities during learning, referred to as multimodal enrichment, can markedly benefit learning outcomes. Why is this? Here, we integrate cognitive, neuroscientific, and computational approaches to understanding the effectiveness of enrichment and discuss recent neuroscience findings indicating that crossmodal responses in sensory and motor brain regions causally contribute to the behavioral benefits of enrichment. The findings provide novel evidence for multimodal theories of enriched learning, challenge assumptions of longstanding cognitive theories, and provide counterevidence to unimodal neurobiologically inspired theories. Enriched educational methods are likely effective not only because they may engage greater levels of attention or deeper levels of processing, but also because multimodal interactions in the brain can enhance learning and memory.

AB  - Blind people’s inferences about how other people see provide a window into fundamental questions about the human capacity to think about one another’s thoughts. By working with blind individuals, we can ask both what kinds of representations people form about others’ minds, and how much these representations depend on the observer having had similar mental states themselves. Thinking about others’ mental states depends on a specific group of brain regions, including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated the representations of others’ mental states in these brain regions, using multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA). We found that, first, in the RTPJ of sighted adults, the pattern of neural response distinguished the source of the mental state (did the protagonist see or hear something?) but not the valence (did the protagonist feel good or bad?). Second, these neural representations were preserved in congenitally blind adults. These results suggest that the temporo-parietal junction contains explicit, abstract representations of features of others’ mental states, including the perceptual source. The persistence of these representations in congenitally blind adults, who have no first-person experience with sight, provides evidence that these representations emerge even in the absence of relevant first-person perceptual experiences.

However, as will be seen, even in the specifically technological realm of computational creativity issues pertaining to human creativity cannot be evaded since, at the very least, the criteria for judging and evaluating the creativity of computational artifacts will originate in the realm of human creativity.

AB  - Discrete architecture is recognized as a computational design approach which uses computation to generate algorithmically combinable aggregations. It is therefore a promising innovation for increasing design process productivity through the adaptability of the aggregations it generates. In the built environment, discrete design is usually identified with the modular method. It is a construction process based on the aggregation of different modules assembled according to well-defined connections to ensure the building’s integrity and functionality. It involves off-site manufacturing, and hence a controlled environment ensuring more predictability over weathering and change. But like in conventional construction practices, the fragmentation of modular construction processes hinders its productivity. As a result, this construction approach requires adequate technologies and communication tools to improve collaboration and productivity. This paper aims to address these requirements by adopting a BIM-driven computational approach to design processes and a robotic approach to prefabrication processes. It proposes a modular construction framework for design and production, and presents the results through a study adopting BIM-driven discrete design and robotic manufacturing.

AB  - This paper makes a novel linkage between the multiple-computations theorem in philosophy of mind and Landauer's principle in physics. The multiple-computations theorem implies that certain physical systems implement simultaneously more than one computation. Landauer's principle implies that the physical implementation of “logically irreversible” functions is accompanied by minimal entropy increase. We show that the multiple-computations theorem is incompatible with, or at least challenges, the universal validity of Landauer's principle. To this end we provide accounts of both ideas in terms of low-level fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics, thus providing a deeper understanding of these ideas than their standard formulations given in the high-level terms of thermodynamics and cognitive science. Since Landauer's principle is pivotal in the attempts to derive the universal validity of the second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics, our result entails that the multiple-computations theorem has crucial implications with respect to the second law. Finally, our analysis contributes to the understanding of notions, such as “logical irreversibility,” “entropy increase,” “implementing a computation,” in terms of fundamental physics, and to resolving open questions in the literature of both fields, such as: what could it possibly mean that a certain physical process implements a certain computation.

AB  - This article introduces differentiated creative search (DCS), a groundbreaking optimization algorithm that revolutionizes traditional decision-making systems in complex environments. In contrast to conventional differential evolution methods, DCS integrates a unique knowledge-acquisition process with a creative realism paradigm, thereby transforming optimization strategies. The primary aim of DCS is to enhance decision-making efficacy by employing a newly proposed dual-strategy approach that balances divergent and convergent thinking within a team-based framework. High-performing members apply divergent thinking via the DCS/Xrand/Linnik(α,σ) strategy, which incorporates existing knowledge and Linnik flights. Conversely, the remaining team harnesses convergent thinking through the DCS/Xbest/Current-to-2rand strategy, which combines insights from both the team leader and fellow members. This division of labor, coupled with a strategy tailored to the performance levels of team members, allows for a dynamic and effective decision-making process. The methodology of DCS involves iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, supported by a differentiated knowledge-acquisition process and retrospective assessments. The algorithm's novelty lies in its differentiated knowledge-acquisition, adjusted based on individual team member performance, fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. The paper's contributions are demonstrated through rigorous testing of DCS on various benchmark functions, including CEC2017, classical, and sensor selection problems, as well as real-world applications such as car side impact design, gear train design, and FM sound wave parameter estimation. The results showcase the promising performance of DCS compared to that of existing algorithms, attributable to its innovative approach to problem solving and decision making in complex scenarios. The results and impact section highlights that DCS considerably outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, offering a robust and versatile tool for complex decision-making systems. Its impact is particularly notable in scenarios requiring a balance between innovative solutions and practical decision-making, making DCS a valuable asset in strategic planning and execution across various industries.

AB  - An analytical and adaptive parameter extraction method is proposed to accurately and efficiently extract the parameters of solar cells' triple-diode lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model. This method can obtain explicit expressions of parameters, facilitating seamless integration into photovoltaic systems for circuit-level simulation and design. The proposed method addresses the lack of analytical parameter extraction methods for triple-diode model, avoids the iteration of numerical methods, and significantly reduces computational complexity, thus improving the overall efficiency of the modeling process. In this method, the principle of effective-diode-based analysis is used to simplify the complex multi-diode model. Recursive thinking is then combined to adaptively extract all parameters through multiple steps according to the number of diodes in the model. Subsequently, the practicability of this method is evaluated by testing on three different equivalent circuit models of solar cells including the single-, double-, and triple-diode models. Furthermore, the universality of this method is demonstrated by testing on three photovoltaic modules of different types including Mono-crystalline, Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and perovskite solar cells at different temperatures and irradiances. Finally, the simulation results based on the extracted parameters are compared with the experimental data to calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) magnitude, which ranges from 10−5 to 10−3, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. As a result, this analytical parameter extraction method provides a robust tool and approach for research and applications in the field of solar cell modeling.

In this paper, the basic applicative system, whether it is a lambda calculus or a system of combinators, is considered as a prototype concept system, using which it is possible to build individual systems that are practically significant for mathematics, computing, or programming. They are families of computational models that have both their own semantics and applied areas. This conceptualization/individualization technique is characteristic of the field of semantic studies. As it turns out, the applicative approach forms a metatheoretical framework that provides the basis for cognitive systems that consider abstract objects and interpret their properties and behavior in the environment of modern computing.

AB  - The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Center, designed by Renzo Piano, a world renown Italian architect and a recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, was described as a piece of “Ecological Architecture” in New Caledonia. This building is recognized by its sustainable ventilation design concept that implements the unique ten shell-like structures for aeration enhancement. This paper presents an approach using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based simulations to compare the numerical predictions with the original architectural insight for a verification of the architect's thinking in his realization of the design purpose. In the analysis, we consider the incompressible isothermal turbulent airflow to examine the interaction of the flow with the building for a better understanding of the wind-driven self-sustaining ventilation mechanism. We also propose a modified model via enlarging the aeration opening with the least blockages along the wind pathway. The simulated results indicate that the improved design substantially enhances the air-intake effectiveness and realizes a satisfactory pressure balance for the Tjibaou Cultural Center.

AB  - Providing high-quality instruction with technology has become more important than ever before. However, the instructional practices and the degree to which key skills, such as digital literacy and computational thinking, are emphasized in classrooms vary considerably between teachers, schools, and countries. The present study was aimed at explaining this variation in the frequency of teaching practices with technology and teachers' emphasis on developing students' computer and information literacy and computational thinking by key aspects of teacher motivation and expertise, school conditions and priorities, and countries' economy and innovation. Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries’ economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. Our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors.

AB  - The importance of oilwater separation processes is rapidly increasing in the modern industry. This family of processes, in fact, is of fundamental importance in solving problems in several industrial sectors, among which, for instance, are the management of oil spills, accidental industrial waste water dispersions, water treatment industry, engine fuel filtration and oil sand tailing technology. This paper, firstly, presents and discusses a biologically inspired design approach, based on biomimicry thinking (BT). Besides integrating linguistic tools and brainstorming within the BT approach, the importance of a stricter integration with the engineering context is also discussed. Secondly, the paper presents a practical application of this approach: design an innovative and sustainable oilwater separation device. In particular, the application of the proposed approach allowed identifying a bioinspired solution capable to improve the process performances in a device based on a known strategy. More in detail, the adopted bioinspired solution consists of a superoleophobic surface that mimics the microstructure of the filefish scale surface and eases the oilwater separation process by hindering oil drops deposition on some surfaces. The cost and resource effectiveness of the practical realisation of this surface greatly benefited by the latest advancements in the additive manufacturing field.

Through my experience of computer modelling and supporting simulation groups over the last 40 years, I seek to draw out important lessons from the past to identify current and future trends, as well as to provide advice to help companies imbed this technology in their design processes. I see a very bright future for simulation and users with good computational skills in both academia and industry.

Using a sample of repeat sales from the Greater London region from 1995 to 2017, I estimate the premium to be approximately 4 percent after controlling for property characteristics and a large set of fixed effects. Increasing public accessibility of information attenuates the effect. Tax considerations, financial constraints, and pricing errors cannot explain the result. I propose a framework of reference dependence and left-digit bias to explain the result, highlighting the presence of behavioural biases in household decisions, even when very high stakes are involved.

AB  - The energy, water and food (EWF) nexus modelling and analysis frameworks proposed recently have demonstrated their effectiveness in the assessment and quantification of synergies and trade-offs in the interlinkages between the three sectors. They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates “algorithmic resilience thinking” to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions.

AI and machine learning (ML) enhance drug design and development by improving our understanding of disease heterogeneity, identifying dysregulated molecular pathways and therapeutic targets, designing and optimizing drug candidates, as well as evaluating in silico clinical efficacy. By providing an unprecedented level of knowledge on both patient specificities and drug candidate properties, AI is fostering the emergence of a computational precision medicine allowing the design of therapies or preventive measures tailored to the singularities of individual patients in terms of their physiology, disease features, and exposure to environmental risks.

AB  - The Department of Medicinal Chemistry, together with the Institute for Structural Biology, Drug Discovery and Development, at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) has evolved, organically with quite a bit of bootstrapping, into a unique drug discovery ecosystem in response to the environment and culture of the university and the wider research enterprise. Each faculty member that joined the department and/or institute added a layer of expertise, technology and most importantly, innovation, that fertilized numerous collaborations within the University and with outside partners. Despite moderate institutional support with respect to a typical drug discovery enterprise, the VCU drug discovery ecosystem has built and maintained an impressive array of facilities and instrumentation for drug synthesis, drug characterization, biomolecular structural analysis and biophysical analysis, and pharmacological studies. Altogether, this ecosystem has had major impacts on numerous therapeutic areas, such as neurology, psychiatry, drugs of abuse, cancer, sickle cell disease, coagulopathy, inflammation, aging disorders and others. Novel tools and strategies for drug discovery, design and development have been developed at VCU in the last five decades; e.g., fundamental rational structure-activity relationship (SAR)-based drug design, structure-based drug design, orthosteric and allosteric drug design, design of multi-functional agents towards polypharmacy outcomes, principles on designing glycosaminoglycans as drugs, and computational tools and algorithms for quantitative SAR (QSAR) and understanding the roles of water and the hydrophobic effect.

AB  - We present a theory of the causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs. Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.

Python was utilized to gather online textual data from Chinese and North American travellers, while word frequency analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling analysis and content analysis were employed to elucidate the perception styles in a cross-cultural context. In general, North American travellers mainly leaned towards analytic thinking, whereas Chinese travellers showcased a blend of holistic and analytic thought processes. The topic of travel, leisure and accommodation showed both holistic and analytic thinking styles. The topics of nature and environment, front desk service, and travel routes and scenic spot areas mainly represented a holistic thinking style. The topics of convenience and facilities, breakfast, transportation, hotel theme and features, and decoration and amenities mainly suggested an analytic thinking style. Hotels should consider the different perception styles of Chinese and North American travellers to facilitate strategies accordingly and to maximize the experience of travellers from different cultural backgrounds.

AB  - In the context of built environment, buildings are amongst the principal generators of environmental externalities. Life Cycle Assessment (LCAs) of energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings are deemed critical to address sustainable development issues. This paper aims to investigate LCA as a tool to support the design of buildings with two objectives in mind. Firstly, it determines the role of LCA in the evaluation of energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings. Secondly, it elaborates LCA of these constructions through the lens of international standards. The methodological approach of the study leads to development of a whole building life cycle formula that sums up the contributions from a set of LCAs. By doing so, the paper highlights the necessity of LCA applications in buildings, and the need for minimisation of resource and energy consumption, and environmental impact. The study helps in better understanding the way LCA supports the search for and identification of innovation pathways in buildings. This paper contributes to the efforts in providing theoretical expansions in LCA of buildings and stimulates the creation of technical standards for the residential building construction sector.

AB  - In the study of brain science, the free energy principle and attention perception mechanism have been the two of the most critical findings during the past few decades, arousing a wide range of attention and valuable applications from the research fields of image and video processing, computer vision, etc. Motivated by the aforementioned two important findings, we in this paper develop a brain-inspired computational model for extremely few reference image quality assessment (IQA), dubbed as BCM. The proposed BCM implements with the two main steps. First, we combine free energy principle and sparse perception mechanism to achieve the goal of only using extremely few reference for assessing the image quality. Second, we further introduce the attention perception mechanism to boost the assessment performance by improving the sparse perception mechanism mentioned above. Based on the most commonly used image quality database, it was found that our proposed model has derived higher performance than the peer extremely few reference IQA models and competitive performance as compared with the benchmark full reference IQA models.

AB  - The ability to identify people who are prosocial, supportive, and mindful of others is critical for choosing social partners. While past work has emphasized the information value of direct social interactions (such as watching someone help or hinder others), social tendencies can also be inferred from indirect evidence, such as how an agent considers others when making personal choices. Here we present a computational model of this capacity, grounded in a Bayesian framework for action understanding. Across four experiments we show that this model captures how people infer social preferences based on how agents act when their choices indirectly impact others (Experiments 1a, 1b, & 1c), and how people infer what an agent knows about others from knowledge of that agent’s social preferences (Experiment 2). Critically, people’s patterns of inferences could not be explained by simpler alternatives. These findings illuminate how people can discern potential social partners from indirect evidence of their prosociality, thus deepening our understanding of partner detection, and social cognition more broadly.

With the emergence of new data collection technologies, advanced data mining and analytics support, there seems to be fundamental changes that are occurring with the research questions we can ask, and the research methods we can apply. The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions.

AB  - Research in computational psychiatry is dominated by models of behavior. Subjective experience during behavioral tasks is not well understood, even though it should be relevant to understanding the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior. When smartphone tasks are collected longitudinally, subjective feelings provide a potential means to bridge the gap between lab-based behavioral tasks and real-life behavior, emotion, and psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - The technological development has raised awareness for the importance of digital competence and computational thinking (CT) to understand the digital world and has resulted in revised curricula in many countries. In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.

AB  - Stem cell tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary area that employs engineering and biological science concepts to build biomimetic alternatives for the maintenance, improvement, and restoration of tissue function. The current developments in advanced technologies (bioprinting and biomanufacturing) are the most needed conditions for manufacturing scaffolds, along with their morphometric properties. With these advancements, the computational models used to produce tissue-engineered implants have become essential. Understanding the history of stem cells and how their use is implemented in disease modeling and pharmaceutical advancements is driving the rapid expansion of the computational biology market. This chapter explores various computational methods for stem cell-based modeling while focusing on computer-aided design in tissue engineering. Briefly, we introduce multiscale computational modeling, the process of cellular differentiation, reprogramming, and related tools and software, describe computer-aided tissue engineering, and also provide the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis.

AB  - Counterfactual thinking is a component of human decision-making that entails “if only” thinking about unselected choices and outcomes. It is associated with strong emotional responses of regret (when the obtained outcome is inferior to the counterfactual) and relief (vice versa). Counterfactual thinking may play a role in various cognitive phenomena in disordered gambling, such as the effects of near-misses. This study compared individuals with gambling disorder (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 25) on a behavioural economic choice task that entailed choosing between two gambles, designed to measure counterfactual thinking. Participants provided affect ratings following both the obtained and the non-obtained outcomes. Choices were analyzed using a computational model that derived parameters reflecting sensitivity to expected value, risk variance, and anticipated regret. In the computational choice model, the group with gambling disorder showed increased sensitivity to anticipated regret, reduced sensitivity to expected value, and increased preference for high risk-variance gambles. On the affect ratings, the group with gambling disorder displayed blunted emotional sensitivity to obtained and counterfactual outcomes. Effect sizes of the group differences were modest. Participants with gambling disorder show wide-ranging alterations in decision-making processes and emotional reactivity to choice outcomes. Altered sensitivity to anticipatory regret in gambling disorder may contribute to the development of gambling-related cognitive distortions, and the influences of gambling marketing.

AB  - Design Thinking is a human-centered approach extensively used across different domains that aims at problem solving, value creation for stakeholders and innovation by fostering creativity. The most characterising and critical step along the Design Thinking process is the empathy phase, in which stakeholder analysis is performed by looking at a given scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders. Such a methodology enables a systematic information gathering and organization that results in a deep understanding of actual problems, needs and expectations from the target stakeholders. The uniqueness of problems and the need for situation-specific data makes knowledge re-use not always practical, even within the most consolidated and experienced environments. In this paper we propose an ontological support to empathy mapping that aims to (i) establish an interoperable fine-grained data layer among the different data collected throughout the empathy mapping process, (ii) enable multi-scenario analysis underpinned by formal specifications and (iii) further empower the process through semantic enrichment and integration of insight from multiple sources and contexts. We believe this is the first step to design and properly integrate effective computational and AI-based functionalities along the creative design thinking process, as well as to enable in practice richer and more sophisticated approaches (e.g. through social networks).

AB  - Decision-making in groups is a remarkable and decisive element of human societies. Humans are able to organize themselves in groups, engage in collaborative decision-making processes and arrive at a binding agreement, even in the absence of unanimous consent. However, the transfer of decision-making autonomy requires a willingness to deliberately expose oneself to the decisions of others. A lack of trust in the abilities of others or of the underlying decision-making process, i.e. public trust, can lead to a breakdown of organizations in political or economic domains. Recent studies indicate that the biological basis of trust on an individual level is related to Oxytocin, an endogenous neuropeptide and hormone, which is also associated with pro-social behavior and positive conflict resolution. However, little is known about the effects of Oxytocin on the inclination of individuals to form or join groups and to deliberately engage in collaborative decision-making processes. Here, we show that intranasal administration of Oxytocin (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 60) in males causes an adverse effect on the choice for forming groups in the presence of a competitive environment. In particular, Oxytocin negatively affects the willingness to work collaboratively in a p-Beauty contest game, whereas the effect is most pronounced for participants with relatively high strategic sophistication. Since our data provide initial evidence that Oxytocin has a positive effect on strategic thinking and performance in the p-Beauty contest game, we argue that the adverse effect on group formation might be rooted in an enhanced strategic sophistication of participants treated with Oxytocin.

AB  - This study aimed at developing an instructional tool for the artificial intelligence education of young students, and used learning analytics to identify the sequential learning behavioral patterns of students during the process of learning with the instructional tool. The instructional experiment took 9 weeks. The first stage of the course was 5 weeks spent on individual learning of MIT App Inventor and Personal Image Classifier. The second stage was 4 weeks spent on cooperative learning to make a robot car and play a computational thinking board game. In the second stage, the students worked in pairs to make the robot car. Finally, they played the computational thinking board game with the personal image classification application they developed in the first stage and the robot car they made in the second stage. The innovative studies found meaningful behavioral patterns when the young students learned the application of artificial intelligence with the instructional tool developed and proposed in the study.

AB  - A thematic relation is a temporal, spatial, causal, or functional relation between things that perform complementary roles in the same scenario or event. For example, cows and milk are related by a production theme, and sails and anchors are related via a boating theme. Thematic relations are distinct from mere associations, scripts, and ad hoc categories. They also contrast and complement taxonomic (categorical) relations such as “fruits” and “furniture.” Thematic relations and taxonomic relations arise from distinct processes, as evidenced by numerous neuropsychological and behavioral dissociations. Thematic relations may be apprehended uncontrollably and rapidly according to how frequently and recently they have been encountered. They exert profound effects on many core cognitive processes, including similarity, categorization, memory, language, inference, and analogy, and they exhibit robust processing differences across individuals and cultures. In sum, without such thematic thinking, models of cognition will remain categorically limited.

AB  - ICT solutions have been proposed as a means for changing environmentally unfavourable traffic behaviour by providing better, real-time and more accessible travel information. However, prevailing models of travel choice and travel behaviour tend to overemphasise the impact and importance of information and the individualistic perspective. The issue of choice and travel planning in everyday life situations, and how information is used and acted on in these processes, was examined in a qualitative study in Stockholm, Sweden. Practice Theory was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Interviews were supplemented with an explorative diary and photo assignment to bring unreflected choices and actions of planning travel to the conscious level. The results showed that travel planning involves the immediate situation where planning and decisions are made, but also aspirations, cognitive/time/material limitations, social norms and social relations that extend widely in time and space. Definitions of travel planning and travel information based on the situated practices of planning are suggested. In the muddle of everyday life, travel planning takes place in the brief moments where circumstances at different levels – time, place, the social realm - interact and are considered or directly acted upon. In the development of new ICT-based travel information services, the role of technology in changing normal practices should be considered.

AB  - This paper provides the first steps towards a theoretical and structural modelling framework through which optimal decision making in financial market infrastructures such as payments clearing and settlement systems can be assessed from a market microstructure perspective. In particular, the paper focuses on the application of agent-based computational economics and stochastic games in modelling the bilateral credit limit establishing behaviour of Participants in loss sharing arrangements within financial market infrastructures such as the Canadian Large Value Payments System (LVTS). With specific focus on the LVTS, the paper presents a structural model where the payments system represents a market in which bilateral credit limits are the pricing mechanisms for intraday liquidity provisioning and the credit risk arising from the loss sharing arrangement. The data-driven stochastic game framework further illustrates how payments data, in conjunction with other financial market and credit data, can be used to assess emergent macroscopic outcomes in clearing and settlement systems from the underpinning interactions of autonomous decision making agents. The paper speaks to potential policy issues such as the effectiveness of policy levers such as the System-Wide Percentage, regulatory concerns around procyclicality and free-riding arising from the market microstructure behaviours, and design of the System.

AB  - During social interactions, we constantly learn about the thoughts, feelings, and personality traits of our interaction partners. Learning in social interactions is critical for bond formation and acquiring knowledge. Importantly, this type of learning is typically bi-directional, as both partners learn about each other simultaneously. Here we review the literature on social learning and propose a new computational and neural model characterizing mutual predictions that take place within and between interactions. According to our model, each partner in the interaction attempts to minimize the prediction error of the self and the interaction partner. In most cases, these inferential models become similar over time, thus enabling mutual understanding to develop. At the neural level, this type of social learning may be supported by interbrain plasticity, defined as a change in interbrain coupling over time in neural networks associated with social learning, among them the mentalizing network, the observation-execution system, and the hippocampus. The mutual prediction model constitutes a promising means of providing empirically verifiable accounts of how relationships develop over time.

Misophonia is a disorder in which certain sounds produced by other people lead to intense negative reactions. It remains unknown how misophonia relates to other psychiatric conditions or impairments. To identify latent constructs underlying symptoms, we conducted a factor analysis consisting of items from questionnaires assessing symptoms of misophonia and other psychiatric conditions. One thousand forty-two participants completed the questionnaires and a social exchange task in which they either could (“controllable”) or could not (“uncontrollable”) influence future monetary offers from other people. Misophonia and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms loaded onto the same factor. Compared with individuals with low Miso-OC factor scores, individuals with high scores reported higher perceived controllability of their social interactions during the uncontrollable condition and stronger aversion to social norm violations in the uncontrollable compared with the controllable condition. Together, these results suggest misophonia, and OC symptoms share a latent psychiatric dimension characterized by aberrant computations of social controllability.

AB  - The lattice theory under the framework of formal concept analysis has brought mathematical thinking to knowledge representation and discovery. In this respect, this mathematical framework offers a conceptual knowledge representation through the Galois lattice. This hierarchical conceptual structure has been beneficial within the task of knowledge discovery in databases. However, its effective use in large datasets is always limited by the overwhelming number of extracted formal concepts. To select interesting formal concepts, the stability measure can be of valuable help. The dedicated literature has highlighted non-scalable approaches to compute such a stability measure. In an effort to tackle this issue, we introduce the Dfsp algorithm dedicated to efficiently compute the quality measure of the stability of formal concepts. We also show that the stability computation is an instantiation of a larger issue: locating minimal generators given the closed pattern as a reference point. The guiding idea of the Dfsp algorithm is to maximize as far as possible the quantity of the useless search space through the swift localization of maximal non-generator cliques. The experiments performed demonstrate the efficiency of the Dfsp algorithm.

AB  - Summary
Replay in the brain has been viewed as rehearsal or, more recently, as sampling from a transition model. Here, we propose a new hypothesis: that replay is able to implement a form of compositional computation where entities are assembled into relationally bound structures to derive qualitatively new knowledge. This idea builds on recent advances in neuroscience, which indicate that the hippocampus flexibly binds objects to generalizable roles and that replay strings these role-bound objects into compound statements. We suggest experiments to test our hypothesis, and we end by noting the implications for AI systems which lack the human ability to radically generalize past experience to solve new problems.

AB  - Understanding cognition has been a central focus for psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers for thousands of years, but many of its most fundamental processes remain very poorly understood. Chief among these is the process of thought itself: the spontaneous emergence of specific ideas within the stream of consciousness. It is widely accepted that ideas, both familiar and novel, arise from the combination of existing concepts. From this perspective, thought is an emergent attribute of memory, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of the neural substrate in which information is embedded. An important issue in any understanding of this process is the relationship between the emergence of conceptual combinations and the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. Virtually all theories of ideation hypothesize that ideas arise during the thought process through association, each one triggering the next through some type of linkage, e.g., structural analogy, semantic similarity, polysemy, etc. In particular, it has been suggested that the creativity of ideation in individuals reflects the qualitative structure of conceptual associations in their minds. Interestingly, psycholinguistic studies have shown that semantic networks across many languages have a particular type of structure with small-world, scale free connectivity. So far, however, these related insights have not been brought together, in part because there has been no explicitly neural model for the dynamics of spontaneous thought. Recently, we have developed such a model. Though simplistic and abstract, this model attempts to capture the most basic aspects of the process hypothesized by theoretical models within a neurodynamical framework. It represents semantic memory as a recurrent semantic neural network with itinerant dynamics. Conceptual combinations arise through this dynamics as co-active groups of neural units, and either dissolve quickly or persist for a time as emergent metastable attractors and are recognized consciously as ideas. The work presented in this paper describes this model in detail, and uses it to systematically study the relationship between the structure of conceptual associations in the neural substrate and the ideas arising from this system’s dynamics. In particular, we consider how the small-world and scale-free characteristics influence the effectiveness of the thought process under several metrics, and show that networks with both attributes indeed provide significant advantages in generating unique conceptual combinations.

AB  - In the age of next-generation sequencing, the availability of increasing amounts and improved quality of data at decreasing cost ought to allow for a better understanding of how natural selection is shaping the genome than ever before. However, alternative forces, such as demography and background selection (BGS), obscure the footprints of positive selection that we would like to identify. In this review, we illustrate recent developments in this area, and outline a roadmap for improved selection inference. We argue (i) that the development and obligatory use of advanced simulation tools is necessary for improved identification of selected loci, (ii) that genomic information from multiple time points will enhance the power of inference, and (iii) that results from experimental evolution should be utilized to better inform population genomic studies.

AB  - Social science scholars have identified a “spatial turn” in energy research over the last three decades. This article systematically reviews the literature on energy, space, and place and decomposes this inter- and transdisciplinary academic landscape. A corpus of 7879 research articles related to spatial perspectives on energy issues is processed and analyzed based on a step-by-step framework for the automated, transparent, and reproducible analysis of large sets of research articles. For this purpose, natural language processing approaches, including named entity recognition and structural topic modeling, are adopted. Based on this large-n selection procedure, selected topics related to the geographical political economy of the energy transition are reviewed in detail. The review maps the geographical scope and scale of the research field, highlights major topics, and shows the distribution of methodological approaches and the role of geographic information systems in this research field. The results show a growing body of literature attentive to socio-spatial variation and the uneven spatiality of energy systems. Nevertheless, uneven geographical distributions of studies with a strong focus on the major industrialized countries and generally only a few comparative cases were also found. In particular, research on the energy transition and renewable energy policy is strongly informed by studies addressing the Global North, limiting the evidence base for other regional contexts from the Global South.

AB  - Many approaches were proposed to model complex socially emotional behavior in virtual actors, such as intelligent tutors, creative assistants, or team partners. They still lack the ‘magic’ of human-level cognition: systems built for one paradigm appear clueless outside of its boundary. Natural cognitive systems, on the other hand, can adapt to unexpected environments and paradigms. To capture the robustness of natural cognitive development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system, embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at different evolutionary levels and in different species are analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of activation during the incubation period increases creative abilities of the system. It is argued that the proposed approach can explain a range of facts and mysteries associated with the human cognitive ontogeny and can provide the basis for a self-sustained evolution of future Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Analysing transcripts of design activity typically involve either close reading or manual coding of data, which limits the amount of data that can be analysed. In contrast, we explore a machine-learning based linguistic analysis tool called Empath to identify patterns of reasoning in design talk. The data we use derives from the Design Thinking Research Symposium (DTRS) shared-data workshops which we analyse to look at two contrasting aspects of design talk: the expression of tentativeness, characterising designers' generative thinking; and the articulation of explanations, characterising their deductive or analytical thinking. We show, at the level of speech turns, how tentativeness and explanation relate to, and overlap, each other. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this ‘linguistic analysis at scale’ approach.

AB  - Recently, a number of predictive coding models have been proposed to account for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)'s symptomatology, including intrusions, flashbacks and hallucinations. These models were usually developed to account for traditional/type-1 PTSD. We here discuss whether these models also apply or can be translated to the case of complex/type-2 PTSD and childhood trauma (cPTSD). The distinction between PTSD and cPTSD is important because the disorders differ in terms of symptomatology and potential mechanisms, how they relate to developmental stages, but also in terms of illness trajectory and treatment. Models of complex trauma could give us insights on hallucinations in physiological/pathological conditions or more generally on the development of intrusive experiences across diagnostic classes.

AB  - Science and philosophy have long struggled with how to even begin studying the neural or computational basis of qualitative experience. Here I review psychological, neuroscience, and philosophical literature to reveal how perceptual metacognition possesses five unique properties that provide a powerful opportunity for studying the neural and computational correlates of subjective experience: (1) Metacognition leads to subjective experiences (we “feel” confident); (2) Metacognition is “about” internal representations, formalizing introspection; (3) Metacognitive computations are “recursive” (applying to meta-cognition and meta-meta-cognition), so we might discover “canonical computations” preserved across processing levels and implementations; (4) Metacognition is anchored to observable behavior; and (5) Metacognitive computations are unobservable yet hierarchically dependent, requiring development of sensitive, specific models. Given these properties, computational models of metacognition provide an empirically-tractable early step in characterizing the generative process that constructs qualitative experience. I also present practical ways to make progress in this vein, applying decades of developments in nearby fields to perceptual metacognition to reveal new and exciting insights about how the brain constructs subjective conscious experiences.

Data analysis was carried out to find factors which influence the child mortality in Asia. Correlation analysis was done to check on the relationship among all the variables, as well as to identify the problem of multicollinearity in the data. Having fitted multiple linear regression, it was found that mortality rate of children under age of five in Asia countries are significantly influenced by percentage of case detection for all forms of tuberculosis, number of reported deaths on measles, number of population using an improved drinking water source, and number of birth trauma reported. Among those variable, it was identified that number of population using an improved drinking water source is the most important factor.

AB  - Physiological studies have shown that a group of locust’s lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) has a diversity of collision selectivity to approaching objects, relatively darker or brighter than their backgrounds in cluttered environments. Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.

AB  - This paper introduces a new solution concept for non-cooperative games in normal form with no ties and pure strategies: the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium. The players are rational in all possible worlds and know each other’s strategies in all possible worlds — which, together, we refer to as Perfect Prediction. The anticipation of a player’s decision by their opponents is counterfactually dependent on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibria where the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium, when it exists, is unique and is Pareto optimal. This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart of the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium; the prediction happens “in another room” rather than in the past. The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter’s superrationality to non-symmetric games. Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a strategy profile that is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible worlds and rationality in all possible worlds, a stronger concept than common knowledge of rationality but also stronger than common counterfactual belief of rationality. We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common to this and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential Decision Theory. We define the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium algorithmically and prove (when it exists) that it is unique, that it is Pareto-optimal, and that it coincides with Hofstadter’s Superrationality on symmetric games. We relate the finding to concepts found in the literature such as Individual Rationality, Rationalizability, Minimax-Rationalizability, Second-Order Nash Equilibria, the Program Equilibrium, the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, Shiffrin’s Joint-Selfish-Rational Equilibrium, the Stalnaker–Bonanno Equilibrium, the Perfect Cooperation Equilibrium, the Translucent Equilibrium, the Correlated Equilibrium, and Quantum Games. Finally, we specifically discuss inclusion relationships on the special case of symmetric games between Individual Rationality, Minimax-Rationalizability, Superrationality, and the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium, and contrast them with asymmetric games.

AB  - The temporo-mandibular joint is a characteristic feature of mammalian development, and essential to mastication and speech, yet it causes more problems than any other joint in the body and remains the least understood. While it is generally accepted that the normal joint is loaded under compression, the problems and controversies surrounding this view remain unresolved and the disparity in opinion over its treatment continues. Although difficulties in the acquisition of reliable information have undoubtedly contributed to this situation, it is now considered that deficits in neural control and shortcomings in the underlying biomechanical theory and analysis have also played a part, and that a re-assessment from a different perspective could resolve these. Biotensegrity considers the TMJ from this position, where the mandible is suspended within a tensioned network that extends over a much wider anatomical field than is generally recognized and significant motion control is contained within the structure itself. It is an evolutionary-conserved arrangement that enables the system to rapidly respond to changing functional demands and provides a more complete model of joint physiology that can be used to guide further research.

AB  - Epidemiological-Mathematical models are powerful tools for estimating the course of a pandemic and exploring different scenarios through pandemic intervention policies (PIPs). These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.

AB  - Mathematical modelling of whole biological cells opens up new opportunities for fundamental and applied biology. In particular in the context of synthetic biology, it opens up the scope for rational engineering and design principles to be applied. But there are precious few such models available. Here I outline the challenges in the way of generating such whole cell models. The inference of parameters, the choice among competing models, and, first and foremost, the reliable construction of such models pose considerable challenges. Recent work in statistical inference, especially parameter estimation, and model selection, coupled to new computationally more efficient methods to simulate large (and stochastic) biochemical reaction systems will be pivotal for the generation of a new generation of whole cell models. But these need to be coupled to better ways of generating models de novo. I outline how this may be achieved, and why this is necessary.

Here a new model is described in which players recognize a correlation between their own contribution and the likely contributions of other players. The correlation is calculated by treating a player's own conjectured contribution just like any other data point within a learning model. Although players recognize that this correlation is not causal, they nevertheless choose to maximize expected utility conditional on their own action rather than standard expected utility. Results from the model explain previously puzzling quantitative trends in the data.

This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the impact of AI on consumer behavior, focusing on the two pivotal phases of AI development over the past 15 years. We start by reviewing the extensively researched, yet still growing, field of algorithmic predictions and decision-making, alongside the varied positive and negative consumer reactions it elicits. Subsequently, we delve into the just emerging field of GenAI. Here, we differentiate between Convergent Thinking GenAI, which is more domain-specific and geared towards pre-defined task completion, and Divergent Thinking GenAI, which is more domain-general and oriented towards new task fulfillment. For each of these realms, we identify key areas for future investigation.

AB  - The notion that self-disorders are at the root of the emergence of schizophrenia rather than a symptom of the disease, is getting more traction in the cognitive sciences. This is in line with philosophical approaches that consider an enactive self, constituted through action and interaction with the environment. We thereby analyze different definitions of the self and evaluate various computational theories lending to these ideas. Bayesian and predictive processing are promising approaches for computational modeling of the “active self”. We evaluate their implementation and challenges in computational psychiatry and cognitive developmental robotics. We describe how and why embodied robotic systems provide a valuable tool in psychiatry to assess, validate, and simulate mechanisms of self-disorders. Specifically, mechanisms involving sensorimotor learning, prediction, and self-other distinction, can be assessed with artificial agents. This link can provide essential insights to the formation of the self and new avenues in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - High-quality mesh surfaces are crucial for geometric processing in a variety of applications. To generate these meshes, polyhedral remeshing techniques truncate Voronoi cells of the original surface and yield precise intersections, but the calculation is complicated. Some methods apply auxiliary points to construct Voronoi diagrams to simplify these techniques, thereby extracting co-planar facets to approximate the original surface. However, extracting these approximate facets from the constructed Voronoi diagram makes it inefficient and non-parallelizable. To this end, we propose an efficient GPU method for manifold surface remeshing, where the restricted tangent face (RTF) is utilized to approximate the original surface. By intersecting the pre-clipped Voronoi cell with the tangent plane, this method directly calculates the RTF of each point without any auxiliary points or traversing Voronoi cells. Moreover, to restrict the movement of points, we introduce a projection method based on the KNN strategy, where each point is projected onto the triangular facet in the original surface. Owing to the independence and non-interference of the RTF computation and projection of each point, our method is implemented in parallel on the GPU. Experimental results on various mesh surfaces demonstrate the superior performance of our method in the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

By teaching students problem formulation, especially in computer science related activities, foundational skills in computational thinking are introduced, used, and refined. Using a problem solving archetype as a means for this formulation is an effective tool for students to leverage. As computational thinking skills are honed, these concepts can translate across barriers into other content areas.

AB  - Social deficits are among the core and most striking psychiatric symptoms, present in most psychiatric disorders. Here, we introduce a novel social learning framework, which consists of neuro-computational models that combine reinforcement learning with various types of social knowledge structures. We outline how this social learning framework can help specify and quantify social psychopathology across disorders and provide an overview of the brain regions that may be involved in this type of social learning. We highlight how this framework can specify commonalities and differences in the social psychopathology of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), personality disorders (PD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) and improve treatments on an individual basis. We conjecture that individuals with psychiatric disorders rely on rigid social knowledge representations when learning about others, albeit the nature of their rigidity and the behavioral consequences can greatly differ. While non-clinical cohorts tend to efficiently adapt social knowledge representations to relevant environmental constraints, psychiatric cohorts may rigidly stick to their preconceived notions or overly coarse knowledge representations during learning.

AB  - Neuroticism is a dimension of personality that captures trait individual differences in the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings. Established theories explain neuroticism in terms of threat sensitivity, but have limited heuristic value since they cannot account for features of neuroticism that are unrelated to threat, such as creativity and negative psychological states experienced in benign, threat-free environments. We address this issue by proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as creativity and nonsituational ‘angst’.

AB  - Computational technologies have vastly replaced our prior modalities of information seeking. Social media platforms have become the first choice of many information seekers. Increasingly, these platforms are also becoming vehicles for coordinated, manipulative disinformation campaigns. These campaigns of computational propaganda have resulted in an information environment in which the assignment of authority and trust in information sources has become increasingly opaque. This epistemic process of information evaluation has increasingly become the purview of automated algorithmic systems that we as human beings tend to falsely implicitly trust to provide us with the most accurate information available. Propagandists have begun to exploit the algorithmic components of these systems as well as human cognitive deficits in order to manipulate public opinion, control the narrative of public discourse, and flood our information ecosystems in order to work towards the manufacture of false consensus on a wide range of political and cultural issues. This work aims to review and synthesize the literature on computational propaganda, how it manipulates our human cognitive deficits, and how information literacy can be utilized in order to correct for the resultant epistemic failure.

AB  - Efim A. Liberman (1925–2011) can be considered as a founder of the new field of science that explores natural computation and its limits. He named it Chaimatics and suggested its generalization to the ultimate all-encompassing theory that unites biology, physics and mathematics. He made a number of experimental discoveries, including color coding in the retina, the participation mechanisms of Ca2+ ions in synaptic transmission, and the measurement of potential in the coupling membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. He also made a decisive contribution to the proof of the chemiosmotic hypothesis of oxidative phosphorylation. In a series of works started in 1972, Liberman developed the concept of the molecular computer of the cell, which includes the programs written on DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences and executed by enzymes playing the role of processing units whereas nucleotide sequences are interpreted as commands and addresses. In this framework, Liberman predicted RNA splicing before its discovery and suggested the role of processing of small informational molecules (later defined as small RNAs) in controlling biological processes. Efim Liberman defined the fundamental property of life as a molecular and quantum computational system and introduced the idea of quantum computing inside a cell for making decisions on complex control tasks described by equations of mathematical physics. He approached the brain as a net of molecular computers and created a model of neuron operation based on the transmission of hypersound signals via cytoskeleton where the molecular computational system encodes the digital output. In 1979 Liberman published a hypothesis of human self-consciousness associated with not a chemical, but with a physical quantum coherent system and named it “extremal quantum regulator”. We review here the contributions of Liberman in understanding the mechanisms of intracellular processing of information and his efforts to create an integrative theory of natural computation that aims to unite biology, physics and mathematics.

AB  - This paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.

AB  - In recent decades pharmaceutics and drug delivery have become increasingly critical in the pharmaceutical industry due to longer time, higher cost, and less productivity of new molecular entities (NMEs). However, current formulation development still relies on traditional trial-and-error experiments, which are time-consuming, costly, and unpredictable. With the exponential growth of computing capability and algorithms, in recent ten years, a new discipline named “computational pharmaceutics” integrates with big data, artificial intelligence, and multi-scale modeling techniques into pharmaceutics, which offered great potential to shift the paradigm of drug delivery. Computational pharmaceutics can provide multi-scale lenses to pharmaceutical scientists, revealing physical, chemical, mathematical, and data-driven details ranging across pre-formulation studies, formulation screening, in vivo prediction in the human body, and precision medicine in the clinic. The present paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review in all areas of computational pharmaceutics and “Pharma 4.0”, including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, molecular modeling, mathematical modeling, process simulation, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. We not only summarized the theories and progress of these technologies but also discussed the regulatory requirements, current challenges, and future perspectives in the area, such as talent training and a culture change in the future pharmaceutical industry.

AB  - Coreless filament winding extends established industrial processes, enabling the fabrication of building parts with minimal formwork. Since the part's final geometry is unknown until completed, it creates uncertainties for design and engineering. Existing architectural design workflows are insufficient, and industrial software packages cannot capture the complexity of self-deforming fibres to model complex fibre layups. This research introduces a feedback-based computational method conceived as four development cycles to design and evaluate fibre layups of large-scale architectural building components, and a multi-scalar digital-physical design and evaluation toolset to model and evaluate them at multiple resolutions. The universal applicability of the developed methods is showcased by two different architectural fibre structures. The results show how the systematization of methods and toolset allow for increased design flexibility and deeper integration of interdisciplinary collaborators. They constitute an important step towards a consolidated co-design methodology and demonstrate the potential to simultaneously co-evolve design and evaluation methods.

AB  - The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated unprecedented collective action against coronavirus disease. In this light,we are proposing a novel online platform for the visualization of epidemiological data incorporating social determinants for understanding the patterns associated with the spread of COVID-19. The current AI computational platform combines modeling methodologies along with temporal geospatial visualization of COVID-19 data, providing real-time sharing of graphic analytical simulation of vulnerable hotspots of recurrent (nowcasting) and emergent (forecasting) infections visualized on a spatiotemporal scale on geoportals. The proposed study will be a secondary data analysis of primary data accessed from the national portal (Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)) incorporating 766 districts in India. Epidemiological data related to spatiotemporal visualization of the demographic spread of COVID-19 will be displayed using a compartmental socio-epidemiological model, reproduction number R, epi-curve diagrams as well as choropleth maps for different levels of administrative and development units at the district levels.

AB  - Multimodal video analysis is a complex and time-consuming process for a researcher; it entails capturing, watching, and re-watching video data to identify which segments best inform or address the questions that drive the research. Modern AI applications can alleviate the challenges that arise during the fine-grained analysis of learners' multimodal interactions captured through video. In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis. Implications for using AI to ease the challenges of multimodal analysis of video data are discussed.

AB  - Natural language provides a rich combinatorial mechanism for encoding meanings - a finite set of words can express an unbounded number of thoughts. Framed in 2015 to extend the purpose of Zadeh's Z-numbers, a Z*-number is a perceptual symbol of the meaning of a natural language expression and consequently mentalese – or internal speech. This article, through decomposition of the Z*-macro-parameters into its atomic constituents, presents a model for the endogenous arousal of thoughts during empathetic, bespoke comprehension of the real-world. Based on Minsky's Society of Mind, the framework is founded on the assimilation of multimodal experiences, a sense of ‘unified self’ and its derivatives (choice, interest, curiosity, etc.), objective and subjective components of knowledge, commonsense, and attention dynamics over a real-world scenario. The model attempts emulation of slow and fast thinking, instinctive reactions, learning, deliberation, reflection and self-conscious decisions. The design has been validated against human responses, and aims to contribute to the development of autonomous artificial systems for man-machine symbiosis.

This framework simulates a construction site by orchestrating 3D mobile objects against a 3D background and produces multimodal labels for target entities. The effectiveness of the synthetic data in training object detection models was thoroughly validated. For the construction worker detection task, a YOLOv7 model trained with synthetic data nearly matched the performance of a model trained with real data: it achieved 71% AP@0.5–0.95 compared to 75% for the real data-trained model. Moreover, the model trained with synthetic data surpassed its real data counterpart in scenarios requiring stricter IoU thresholds, particularly above 85%. Acquiring a sufficient quantity and diverse range of imagery data has been a primary challenge in construction studies that focus on automation and digitization through deep neural networks. BlendCon can significantly contribute to addressing this data scarcity challenge.

Combining data on patents and multinational corporation networks, we show that the cross-border effect of tax policy changes depends on whether co-location of the IP and the underlying R&D activity is required. Patent boxes without such a requirement increase patent output in other countries. Patent boxes with such a requirement reduce patent output abroad but only when relocation costs for R&D activity are small.

AB  - Summary
The brains and minds of our human ancestors remain inaccessible for experimental exploration. Therefore, we reconstructed human cognitive evolution by projecting nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (ω values) in mammalian phylogeny onto the anatomically modern human (AMH) brain. This atlas retraces human neurogenetic selection and allows imputation of ancestral evolution in task-related functional networks (FNs). Adaptive evolution (high ω values) is associated with excitatory neurons and synaptic function. It shifted from FNs for motor control in anthropoid ancestry (60–41 mya) to attention in ancient hominoids (26–19 mya) and hominids (19–7.4 mya). Selection in FNs for language emerged with an early hominin ancestor (7.4–1.7 mya) and was later accompanied by adaptive evolution in FNs for strategic thinking during recent (0.8 mya–present) speciation of AMHs. This pattern mirrors increasingly complex cognitive demands and suggests that co-selection for language alongside strategic thinking may have separated AMHs from their archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal relatives.

AB  - Data-driven urbanism is often entangled with the smart city and practiced in a way that prioritizes control over physical objects and downplays the human and political aspects of data. We label this approach ‘hard city sensing’ (HCS) and we argue that the rise of the ‘digital city’ offers the empirical foundation for more humanistic approaches. Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning.

AB  - State-dependent computation is key to cognition in both biological and artificial systems. Alan Turing recognized the power of stateful computation when he created the Turing machine with theoretically infinite computational capacity in 1936. Independently, by 1950, ethologists such as Tinbergen and Lorenz also began to implicitly embed rudimentary forms of state-dependent computation to create qualitative models of internal drives and naturally occurring animal behaviors. Here, we reformulate core ethological concepts in explicitly dynamical systems terms for stateful computation. We examine, based on a wealth of recent neural data collected during complex innate behaviors across species, the neural dynamics that determine the temporal structure of internal states. We will also discuss the degree to which the brain can be hierarchically partitioned into nested dynamical systems and the need for a multi-dimensional state-space model of the neuromodulatory system that underlies motivational and affective states.

AB  - The complex reward structure of the social world and the uncertainty endemic to social contexts poses a challenge for modeling. For example, during social interactions, the actions of one person influence the internal states of another. These social dependencies make it difficult to formalize social learning problems in a mathematically tractable way. While it is tempting to dispense with these complexities, they are a defining feature of social life. Because the structure of social interactions challenges the simplifying assumptions often made in models, they make an ideal testbed for computational models of cognition. By adopting a framework that embeds existing social knowledge into the model, we can go beyond explaining behaviors in laboratory tasks to explaining those observed in the wild.

AB  - Total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is done on individuals with end-stage osteoarthritis to restore knee function and alleviate joint discomfort. There have been recent developments in the design of customized implants based on patient-specific data obtained from MRI scans and subsequent image processing techniques. Here curvature of the femoral component plays an important role in effective implant design. Therefore, the objective here is to investigate the influence of this curvature of the femoral component on the mechanical response of the bearing component. A 3D finite element knee implant model with a circular and an elliptical femoral component is developed and investigated for gait kinetics and kinematics. Responses such as contact pressure, stresses, strains, and wear produced on the tibial insert are estimated throughout the gait cycle. These findings suggest that the elliptical femoral component generates less contact pressure on the tibial insert than its circular counterpart. It is also inferred that too much variation in this curvature is not recommended as it may affect the patient's comfort level. In addition, the wear of the tibial insert is computed based on the contact pressure created by both knee implant models. Our study suggests an optimum value for the curvature and the comfort level of the patients over the existing knee implant designs.

AB  - Computational biology has amplified the current research on stem cells and the ability to transform them into innovative novel drugs to treat and prevent diseases as well as apply as regenerative medicine. For more than fivedecades, one of the critical purposes of computational biology has been to explore the dynamics underlying developmental routes. Challenges that currently exist between computational biology and biological computation were outlined and further discussed for a solution to fill the persistent “wet dry” research gap for a better future. Emerging proper techniques for combining data from several modalities is the foremost challenge in handling single-cell multimodal data. This process has been referred to as “data integration” It includes various strategies, from batch-correcting individual omics datasets to correlating chromatin accessibility to development in virtually all genetic mutations with transcription. In this chapter, we offer solutions for how researchers can overcome challenges to inspire the creation of various computer science algorithms and approaches, as well as how computational methods and mathematical modeling have aided in the comprehension of different biological domains, including computational and stem cell biology. A few current references and examples have been incorporated to explain the emerging concepts in computational biology and address existing problems. They are discussed here with their future aspects, hoping to encourage younger researchers to work in this fascinating field and deal with the challenges mentioned before with a modern approach.

AB  - Part of marketing academia’s mandate is to generate findings that improve management practice. Managerial relevance plays a key role in this mandate as it describes a research project’s potential to influence managerial decision-making and thinking. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what makes research managerially relevant and to uncover success factors in the genesis of such research. This study addresses these issues through a qualitative analysis of 65 depth interviews with senior editors of business transfer journals, marketing managers, and academic researchers. The authors carve out distinct, multidimensional properties that determine managerial relevance. From specific configurations of these properties, four archetypical relevance types emerge: (1) problem-solving, (2) explicating, (3) consolidating, and (4) forward-thinking relevance. Finally, the authors develop a unifying framework and identify success factors for generating highly relevant research. Based on these insights, they suggest concrete courses of action for academics who seek to increase the managerial relevance of their research.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a push to introduce coding and computational thinking in early childhood education, and robotics is an excellent tool to achieve this. However, the integration of these fundamental skills into formal and official curriculums is still a challenge and educators needs pedagogical perspectives to properly integrate robotics, coding and computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. Thus, this study evaluates a “coding as a playground” experience in keeping with the Positive Technological Development (PTD) framework with the KIBO robotics kit, specially designed for young children. The research was conducted with preschool children aged 3–5 years old (N = 172) from three Spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms.

AB  - This paper presents a new proposal of an efficient computational model of face recognition which uses cues from the distributed face recognition mechanism of the brain, and by gathering engineering equivalent of these cues from existing literature. Three distinct and widely used features – Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Principal components (PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and yet effective. The HOG and LBP features further undergo Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them to form a sparsely connected model. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments are carried out using eight publicly available face datasets to validate our proposed model’s performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of illumination, pose angle, expression, and background. We also investigate the same mechanism because of reasons discussed later, on object recognition tasks as well. Results obtained are extremely promising when compared with other face and object recognition algorithms including CNN and deep learning-based methods. This highlights that simple computational processes, if clubbed properly, can produce competing performance with best algorithms.

AB  - Although it has been known for decades that stress influences memory performance, it was only recently shown that stress may alter the contribution of multiple, anatomically and functionally distinct memory systems to behavior. Here, we review recent animal and human studies demonstrating that stress promotes a shift from flexible ‘cognitive’ to rather rigid ‘habit’ memory systems and discuss, based on recent neuroimaging data in humans, the underlying brain mechanisms. We argue that, despite being generally adaptive, this stress-induced shift towards ‘habit’ memory may, in vulnerable individuals, be a risk factor for psychopathology.

AB  - In recent years there has been a growing emphasis placed on access to computational thinking (CT) instruction for every K-12 student in the United States (U.S.). Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts.

AB  - Many academic and practice articles have been published in healthcare operations management literature documenting the experience of implementing lean thinking (LT) in healthcare institutions. But, none of them have developed a procedure for assessing the implementation of LT in healthcare institutions. Lack of assessment procedures make it difficult to evaluate the progress made during the implementation of LT. The current study attempts to address this gap by developing and demonstrating an assessment procedure to evaluate the extent of lean implementation in a healthcare institution To begin with, different lean tenets and elements applied in healthcare institutions were identified through a literature review. Following it, a Fuzzy-Logic Input Based Healthcare Institution Lean Implementation Assessment (FLB-HLIA) was developed and deployed in an Indian case hospital to compute “Healthcare Institution’s Lean Implementation Index” (HLII). FLB-HLIA revealed that the case hospital has to focus on two lean tenets, namely establishing pull system, and seeking perfection, to improve its HLII. Assessment also revealed the lean elements that the case hospital can focus to upgrade its HLII. HLII can be used by practitioners to perform intra-benchmarking and inter-benchmarking of healthcare institutions. Results of FLB-HLIA provide a future action plan for the lean implementation journey of the healthcare institution by identifying the possible areas of improvement for future.

AB  - This paper explores the effects of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into decision-making processes within organizations, employing a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design. The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.

AB  - Nowadays, more and more multimedia services are supported by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, the instability of the wireless environment brings a lot of uncertainty to the computational offloading. Additionally, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as a potential technology to enhance Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a framework for IRS-assisted MEC computational offloading to solve this problem and take fairness optimization as a key point involving communication and computing resources. Minimize user consumption by optimizing bandwidth allocation, task offloading ratio, edge computing resources, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Firstly, we decompose the problem into three aspects, such as bandwidth allocation, computing resource allocation, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimum solution and its convergence is proved. Secondly, since the optimization problem on transmission power and IRS phase shifts is non-convex, we propose Riemann gradient descent (R-SGD) algorithm to solve it. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms and achieves a superiority in the framework.

AB  - Digital technologies are changing how and where we live, work and socialize. Rural areas are distinctive spaces and places but in the current debates of new digital phenomena, digital spaces and practices risk not being contextualized with sensitivities to rural geographies. This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.

The research focused on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and its influence on non-linear optical (NLO) properties. The NLO analysis revealed that the protonated forms of these compounds exhibit higher dipole moments, indicating their potential for NLO applications. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis identified molecule 5 as having the highest E(2) value of 509.41 kcal/mol, signifying strong electron donation from nitrogen to hydrogen atoms. The study also evaluated the thermal properties, showing that the Gibbs free energy remained positive across a wide temperature range, suggesting that none of the compounds are spontaneously formed in either neutral or protonated states. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations indicated favorable adsorption energies for these derivatives on the Fe (110) surface, with compound 5 demonstrating the most significant inhibitory potential. We conduced of that, lower negative adsorption energy (−216.729) compound 1 are confirm with highest energy gap (3.396 eV), and smaller refractive index, and electrical conductivityof compound 1 indicates a small metal-inhibitor molecule interaction, as well as are agreement with Monte Carlo simulation for adsorption on Fe (110) non protonated case.
