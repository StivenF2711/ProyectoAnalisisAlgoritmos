AB  - The technologies discussed in previous chapters provide an unprecedented lens on single cells, phenotypes, and their interactions. In this chapter, we discuss tissue schematics (as introduced in Bhate et al., 2021): a computational and conceptual framework for using highly multiplexed imaging data to infer and visually represent how complex, tissue-level behaviors are generated through the composition of simpler, interpretable biological processes. We focus on the practical application of tissue schematics for generating biological understanding of tissues from imaging data.

AB  - The recent article: Nature 579, 327–328 (2020), ending with the phrase: “You can’t just suddenly make a conference be online.”, has motivated us to write about the practicalities and philosophy of running online events, drawing on our extensive experience running an annual online computational chemistry conference. Our goals for this online conference series have always been: (1) Availability; (2) Community building and (3) Supporting young scientists. In this article, we highlight the motivations behind our initiative, how this has influenced the organisation of our online meeting, and discuss the benefits as well as the drawbacks of virtual meetings. Virtual conferences may not fully replace in-person meetings, but they are rapidly becoming an accepted alternative format. We discuss the hybrid online/in-person conference format as a future possibility that may offer an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact and accessibility barriers associate with in-person meetings without comprising networking and community-building opportunities.

AB  - The natural world is constantly changing, and planetary boundaries are issuing severe warnings about biodiversity and cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In other views, social problems such as global warming and food shortages are spreading to various fields. These seemingly unrelated issues are closely related, but it can be said that understanding them in an integrated manner is still a step away. However, progress in analytical technologies has been recognized in various fields and, from a microscopic perspective, with the development of instruments including next-generation sequencers (NGS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), various forms of molecular information such as genome data, microflora structure, metabolome, proteome, and lipidome can be obtained. The development of new technology has made it possible to obtain molecular information in a variety of forms. From a macroscopic perspective, the development of environmental analytical instruments and environmental measurement facilities such as satellites, drones, observation ships, and semiconductor censors has increased the data availability for various environmental factors. Based on these background, the role of computational science is to provide a mechanism for integrating and understanding these seemingly disparate data sets. This review describes machine learning and the need for structural equations and statistical causal inference of these data to solve these problems. In addition to introducing actual examples of how these technologies can be utilized, we will discuss how to use these technologies to implement environmentally friendly technologies in society.

AB  - Limited resources and low computing power of embedded platform make it difficult to apply neural network technology. To overcome this problem, a new neural network computing framework “Zynq-Darknet” was proposed. The framework is based on Darknet, which constructs depthwise separable convolution and a lightweight classiﬁcation model MobileNetV2 and was deployed to Xilinx Zynq-7000 System-on-Chip (SoC) with Linux operating system (OS). In order to verify the performance of the framework and model, experiments were conducted on imagenet-1k dataset using different network structures. The results show that the MobileNetV2 network model based on Zynq-Darknet can effectively perform image classification, and ensure a certain real-time and accuracy while reducing the computational complexity and storage overhead, assuming promising application prospects.

KW  - Semi-supervised video object segmentation

KW  - Hierarchical grouping
AB  - In Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS), there is a critical emphasis on enhancing the memory and readout mechanisms for frame matching, especially in relation to temporal dynamics. Current methods predominantly use 2D CNNs for encoding video frames, which unfortunately neglects the crucial aspect of addressing temporal variations in individual frames and their associated masks during the encoding process. One potential solution would be to implement temporal models such as 3D CNNs instead of 2D CNNs, but this significantly increases computational requirements, making it impractical for real-world SVOS applications. In this paper, we introduce the Grouped Temporal Recalibration with Attention for Convolutional Encoders (G-TRACE), a novel plug-and-play module that is compatible with various existing SVOS frameworks. G-TRACE uses hierarchical memory-centric attention and integrates effortlessly with 2D CNNs, offering a novel approach to temporal modeling that operates orthogonally to traditional frame matching methods. Extensive evaluations on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently delivers significant performance improvements over various baseline models.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) research include advancements in natural language processing (NLP) achieved by large language models (LLMs), and; in particular, generative pre–trained transformer (GPT) architectures. The latest GPT developed by OpenAI, GPT–4, has shown remarkable intelligence across various domains and tasks. It exhibits capabilities in abstraction, comprehension, vision, computer coding, mathematics, and more, suggesting it to be a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), a level of AI that possesses capabilities similar to human intelligence. This paper explores this AGI, its knowledge diffusive and societal influences, and its governance. In addition to coverage of the major associated topics studied in the literature, and making up for their loopholes, we scrutinize how GPT-4 can facilitate the diffusion of knowledge across different areas of science by promoting their interpretability and explainability (IE) to inexperts. Where applicable, the topics are also accompanied by their specific potential implications on medical imaging.

AB  - Introduction
Multifactorial falls risk assessment tools (FRATs) can be an effective falls prevention method for older adults, but are often underutilized by health care professionals (HCPs). This study aims to enhance the use and implementation of multifactorial FRATs by combining behavioral theory with the user-centered design (UCD) method of personas construction. Specifically, the study aimed to (1) construct personas that are based on external (i.e., needs, preferences) and intrinsic user characteristics (i.e., behavioral determinants); and (2) use these insights to inform requirements for optimizing an existing Dutch multifactorial FRAT (i.e., the ‘Valanalyse’).
Methods
Survey data from HCPs (n = 31) was used to construct personas of the ‘Valanalyse.’ To examine differences between clusters on 68 clustering variables, a multivariate cluster analysis technique with non-parametric analyses and computational methods was used. The aggregated external and intrinsic user characteristics of personas were used to inform key design and implementation requirements for the ‘Valanalyse,’ respectively, whereby intrinsic user characteristics were matched with appropriate behavior change techniques to guide implementation.
Results
Significant differences between clusters were observed in 20 clustering variables (e.g., behavioral beliefs, situations for use). These variables were used to construct six personas representing users of each cluster. Together, the six personas helped operationalize four key design requirements (e.g., guide treatment-related decision making) and 14 implementation strategies (e.g., planning coping responses) for optimizing the ‘Valanalyse’ in Dutch geriatric, primary care settings.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that theory- and evidence-based personas that encompass both external and intrinsic user characteristics are a useful method for understanding how the use and implementation of multifactorial FRATs can be optimized with and for HCPs, providing important implications for developers and eHealth interventions with regards to encouraging technology adoption.

AB  - Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.

AB  - System approaches in biology have a long history. We focus here on the thinking of Paul A. Weiss and Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who contributed a great deal towards making the system concept operable in biology in the early 20th century. To them, considering whole living systems, which includes their organisation or order, is equally important as the dynamics within systems and the interplay between different levels from molecules over cells to organisms. They also called for taking the intrinsic activity of living systems and the conservation of system states into account. We compare these notions with today's systems biology, which is often a bottom-up approach from molecular dynamics to cellular behaviour. We conclude that bringing together the early heuristics with recent formalisms and novel experimental set-ups can lead to fruitful results and understanding.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that incorporating hemp fibers into earth bricks can provide an adequate level of thermal comfort by enhancing the material's dynamic thermal characteristics. The main goal is to find the optimal thickness of a clay-hemp wall to attain the highest thermal inertia values. First, the flash method was used to estimate thermal diffusivity, and the state hot plate method was used to measure the thermal conductivity of a clay brick. Using the experimental data as input, computational analysis is performed to investigate the relationship between the thermal performance of composite materials and their microstructures, with the goal of predicting the effective thermal conductivity of the composite clay-hemp. Using the Random Sequential Addition algorithm, a two-phase, three-dimensional composite clay-hemp microstructure was produced. The effective thermal conductivity of these composites was assessed using the finite volume method. The predicted thermophysical characteristics were then utilized to simulate the transient heat transfer across clay-hemp walls. The results demonstrate that when the hemp volume fraction increased, the thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal volumetric capacity all decreased by approximately 52%, 27%, and 35%, respectively. Furthermore, incorporating hemp fibers improved the bricks' dynamic thermal characteristics. Finally, this study has revealed that a wall composed of clay-hemp bricks of 22 cm thick and an insulating layer of 6 cm thick allows for limiting the risk of overheating during the summer months (time lag between 10 and 12 h) while also satisfying the Moroccan Thermal Construction Regulation requirement for Marrakech city.

AB  - The traditional Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm control mainly adopts the ground station method, which is too fixed, and the interaction is difficult to meet the high dynamic task requirements. There is an urgent need for new interaction methods to integrate the advantages of human thinking in dealing with uncertain problems. Nevertheless, brain-computer interface(BCI) technology is directly controlled by thoughts, one of the most promising next-generation human–computer interaction technologies. Therefore, in this study, we innovatively applied the BCI system based on Virtual Reality (VR) to the group UAV and realized a novel and intelligent group control method, which proposes new ideas and paradigms for the control of swarm UAVs in the future. Specifically, this study takes a quadcopter as an example. A modular and extensible multi-quadcopter system was created, and then a visual stimulation 3D VR scene system with a digital twin function was established. On this basis, the BCI system based on the Stable state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm was adopted for the swarm control of the quadcopter. The experimental results show that the formation control of multi-quadcopter is successfully realized by the subjects using the proposed VR-based BCI interactive system, with an accuracy rate of 90% and a good performance in information transmission rate. In addition, the immersive VR twin system established one-to-one for EEG signal acquisition allows subjects to have a better experience.

While other types of shipping pollutants have been regulated and societal awareness has been raised, due to the intangible characteristics of underwater noise pollution, there is neither societal awareness nor an international legally binding instrument to mitigate underwater noise pollution. This paper aims to raise awareness of ship owners regarding UWN pollution by introducing the sources of UWN pollution, as well as proposing a transdisciplinary policy for shipping companies to mitigate UWN pollution from their ships. The proposed policy is aligned with IMO's initial GHG strategy, especially the Energy Efficiency Design Index, Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index, and Enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan. This multi-dimensional approach will make stakeholders more enthusiastic to tackle underwater noise pollution while enhancing the efficient use of capacities and resources.

In the past two decades, high-throughput, large-scale molecular biology approaches (omics technologies) and advances in computational approaches have significantly grown and provided valuable insight into disease mechanisms, underlying toxicities, and gene–environment interactions. Systems biology approaches have also been widely used in immunotoxicology and helped understand the structure and function of immune system at multiple levels. Integrative models of the human immune response allowed for the assessment of complex immune effects, multilevel networks of interactions, identification of biomarkers and extrapolation of early molecular/cellular events to long-term outcomes at the organism level. Such efforts also created a potential for more predictive and accurate risk-assessment strategies. This chapter focuses on systems biology approaches and computational tools used in immunotoxicology and discuss their application in risk assessment.

We explored the links between these variables and compulsive Internet use in a sample of 509 teenagers and adults aged 11 to 67. We investigated the effect of compulsive Internet use on cyberbullying through fake news creation and/or distribution, both direct and via moral disengagement, and the related differences between adults and teenagers. The indirect effect of compulsive Internet use on cyberbullying through moral disengagement was significant in adolescents, but not in adults. As assumed, teenagers scored significantly higher than adults on all the primary variables. Contrary to our expectations, no significant gender differences emerged, regardless of participants' age, in terms of compulsive Internet use, moral disengagement, nor cyberbullying. The results emphasize the importance of relevant online education programs designed to engage both teenagers and adults in critical thinking that might help in the fake news detection process, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the influence of vertical position on power judgments. Participants were asked to identify whether a Chinese word represented a powerful or powerless group (e.g., “king” or “servant”), which was presented in the top or bottom of the screen. The behavioral analysis showed that judging the power of powerful words were significantly faster when they were presented at the top position, compared with when they were presented at the bottom position. The ERP analysis showed enhanced N1 amplitude for congruent trials (i.e., the powerful words in the top and the powerless words in the bottom of the screen) and larger P300 and LPC amplitude for incongruent trials (i.e., the powerful words in the bottom and the powerless words in the top of the screen). The present findings provide further electrophysiological evidence that thinking about power can automatically activate the underlying spatial up-down (verticality) image schema and that the influence of vertical position on the power judgments not only occurs at the early perceptual stage of power word processing, but also at the higher cognitive stage (i.e., allocation of attention resources, conflict solving and response selection). This study revealed the neural underpinnings of metaphor congruent effect which have great significance to our understanding of the abstract concept power.

AB  - One of the aims of neuromorphic engineering is to implement elements of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, in particular artificial neural networks, with hardware that reflects the massively distributed nature of these bioinspired architectures. In this chapter, we introduce history, basic concepts, and applications of AI, in order to establish a working framework for the development of neuromorphic systems. We present the fundamentals of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) and expound on the relationship among these algorithms based on neural networks, to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current AI systems. Basic concepts and working principles, such as neurons, activation functions, feedforward networks, etc., are presented, and the performances of these algorithms in terms of functionality, computational complexity, and energy consumption are reviewed. Moreover, strengths and limits of different AI architectures are discussed, giving an overview of the development and applications of neuromorphic computing architectures.

AB  - Making is a relatively new concept applied to describe the increasing attention paid to constructing activities to enable entertaining, and engaging learning. Making focuses on the process that occurs in digital and/or physical spaces that is not always learning oriented, but enables qualities such as problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, and innovation, to name a few. Contemporary technical and infrastructural developments, such as Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, TechShops, and FabLabs, and the appearance of tools such as wearable computing, robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages, posit making as a very promising research area to support learning processes, especially towards the acquisition of 21st-century learning competences. Collecting learning evidence via rigorous multidimensional and multidisciplinary case studies will allow us to better understand and improve the value of making and the role of the various digital and physical spaces. Drawing from our experience with a recent workshop that used making as a pathway to foster joyful engagement and creativity in learning (Make2Learn), we present the developments, as well as the four selected contributions of this special issue. The paper further draws attention to the great potential and need for research in the area of making to enable entertaining, and engaging, and learning.

AB  - We develop further here the only quantitative theory of the storage of information in the hippocampal episodic memory system and its recall back to the neocortex. The theory is upgraded to account for a revolution in understanding of spatial representations in the primate, including human, hippocampus, that go beyond the place where the individual is located, to the location being viewed in a scene. This is fundamental to much primate episodic memory and navigation: functions supported in humans by pathways that build ‘where’ spatial view representations by feature combinations in a ventromedial visual cortical stream, separate from those for ‘what’ object and face information to the inferior temporal visual cortex, and for reward information from the orbitofrontal cortex. Key new computational developments include the capacity of the CA3 attractor network for storing whole charts of space; how the correlations inherent in self-organizing continuous spatial representations impact the storage capacity; how the CA3 network can combine continuous spatial and discrete object and reward representations; the roles of the rewards that reach the hippocampus in the later consolidation into long-term memory in part via cholinergic pathways from the orbitofrontal cortex; and new ways of analysing neocortical information storage using Potts networks.

AB  - AI education aims to teach AI concepts, essential knowledge, and skills related to the fundamental ideas in AI. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, schools and educators have started to recognize the importance of AI education in K-12 schools. However, there have been a limited number of studies reporting on the implementation of AI education in classrooms. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the current state of AI education in K-12 schools, exploring topics, instructional approaches, and learning outcomes. Twenty-five peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2018 and 2023 were selected for this systematic review. The findings highlighted that various topics were covered in K-12 AI education, including fundamental AI concepts, different types of AI, AI applications, and ethical considerations related to AI. To facilitate meaningful learning experiences, educators frequently integrated hands-on activities and project-based learning. The findings supported the benefits of AI education in enhancing students' AI literacy, problem-solving skills, and ethical reflections on AI's societal impact. Furthermore, it fostered motivation, positive attitudes toward AI, and an interest in technology while inspiring career aspirations. It is recommended to develop tailored AI curricula, instructional strategies, and appropriate tools and resources that seamlessly integrate into various subjects within the standard school curriculum.

A general layout is able to take into account an interaction of crowdsourcers and properties when they are varying with the evolving the events. The cognition model is of stage-by-stage type and has the representable functor. This model as may be shown is faithfully embedded into a category of indexed sets.

AB  - In the early days of computation the focus was mainly on designing, developing, maintaining, and administering infrastructures and information systems housed in data centers. To this extend, security was traditionally organized around the basic technical components (e.g. data center facilities). The point was that an associated security activity was mostly separated from a business context and in general executed by the technical staff. Security was not fully understood by other audiences because the computer terminologies were frequently used. When security elements (e.g. logical access protocols used for identification, authentication, authorization) became part of the financial statement audit, its context became clearer, and it was conducted for external auditors. However, the presented outcome of the work was not completely interpretable for these practitioners as again, it was mainly reported in Information Technology (IT) jargon, and was not linked with the financial statement either. With the emergence the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) and the fundamental role of IT in relation hereto, the context of security suddenly changed to a great extent. The audience extended as compliance, including security, became the dominating item on the agenda of many C-levels (e.g. CFOs).

AB  - Humanity’s future sustainable supply of energy, fuels and materials is aiming towards renewable sources such as biomass. Several studies on biomass value chains (BVCs) have demonstrated the feasibility of biomass in replacing fossil fuels. However, many of the activities along the chain can disrupt the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus given that these resource systems have been ever more interlinked due to increased global population and urbanisation. Essentially, the design of BVCs has to integrate the systems-thinking approach of the FEW nexus; such that, existing concerns on food, water and energy security, as well as the interactions of the BVCs with the nexus, can be incorporated in future policies. To date, there has been little to no literature that captures the synergistic opportunities between BVCs and the FEW nexus. This paper presents the first survey of process systems engineering approaches for the design of BVCs, focusing on whether and how these approaches considered synergies with the FEW nexus. Among the surveyed mathematical models, the approaches include multi-stage supply chain, temporal and spatial integration, multi-objective optimisation and uncertainty-based risk management. Although the majority of current studies are more focused on the economic impacts of BVCs, the mathematical tools can be remarkably useful in addressing critical sustainability issues in BVCs. Thus, future research directions must capture the details of food–energy–water interactions with the BVCs, together with the development of more insightful multi-scale, multi-stage, multi-objective and uncertainty-based approaches.

AB  - Shrinkage methods reduce the search space of a Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) by progressively discarding candidates, which accelerates the search speed. However, their shrinkage strategy suffers from the vulnerability of too fine task granularity. In other words, they drop only one of the least promising candidates per round of shrinkage, which is suboptimal in terms of performance and efficiency. In this study, we introduce the concept of Granular Computing (GrC) into the shrinkage method and present a Fast Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search (FP-DARTS) method. This method effectively reduces the computational complexity of each round of shrinkage, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of the algorithm. FP-DARTS can be divided into three stages: adaptive granularity division and selection, granular-channel performance evaluation, and progressive shrinkage. In the first stage, to reorganize the task granularity, we cluster the candidate operations into granular-channels and adaptively select the appropriate task granularity. We also propose a dynamic clustering strategy to avoid introducing additional computation. In the second stage, we train the architecture parameters to measure the potential of the granular-channels. In the third stage, to improve the stability of the shrinkage results, we introduce a channel annealing mechanism to smoothly discard unpromising granular-channels. We conducted systematic experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and achieved a test accuracy of 97.56% on CIFAR-10 with 0.04 GPU-days, and a test accuracy of 75.5% on ImageNet with 1.2 GPU-days. We also conducted experiments on the search space of NAS-Bench-201, and obtained test accuracies of 94.22, 73.07, and 46.23% for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet16-120, respectively. The above experimental results demonstrate that FP-DARTS achieves higher search speed and competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art shrinkage methods and non-shrinkage methods.

AB  - A multi-gradient cavity acoustic metamaterial (MCAM) structure and a modular reverse design method (MRDM) that can realize high ventilation and broadband acoustic isolation are proposed. The method controls the deep neural network model of acoustic metamaterials through a particle swarm algorithm, and the optimized multi-gradient cavity acoustic metamaterial structure (OMCAM) can be reverse-designed by inputting only the constraints and the objective function such as the amount of noise reduction. Compared with the finite element method, the computational efficiency can be improved by about 500 times to achieve an optimized design. The acoustic simulation results show that the average noise reduction of the structure is 23.5 dB in the range of 0∼4000 Hz, and a broadband sound attenuation with 38 dB noise reduction is formed in the target frequency band of 500Hz∼2000 Hz. The acoustic experimental results of the 3D-printed structure are in agreement with the simulation results. Compared with the two existing ventilated acoustic metamaterials, the average noise reduction of OMCAM under equal ventilation capacity is improved by 10.6 dB and 17.4 dB, respectively. The sound barrier based on the proposed OMCAM design is implemented on an elevated rail transit line, showing an improvement of 9.4 dB of average noise reduction compared with existing upright railroad sound barriers. The noise reduction mechanism of the OMCAM structure was finally revealed by the sound field distribution in different modes.

AB  - Introduction
Despite national policy changes, perspective changes on pregnancy and parenting in training are often lacking. We evaluated current viewpoints regarding pregnancy, parenthood, leave needs, and perceptions of support across trainees at our institution.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was sent to all residents and fellows at a tertiary care academic center with >700 trainees. Demographic information, opinions on maternity and paternity leave, and opinions on institutional support and career goals were collected. The survey was sent via the Graduate Medical Education Office listserv -- 66 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) programs and 40 non-ACGME programs.
Results
Seven hundred and forty-seven house officers received the survey with a response rate of 21.9% (n = 164). Of respondents, 81% were residents and 99 respondents were female (representing 31% of female trainees at our institution). Thirty-seven point two percent of respondents reported being parents. Twenty-five point three percent of respondents had been pregnant while a trainee with no statistical difference by specialty type (P = 0.0817). Statistically significant difference was noted in having children based on sex with men becoming parents at twice the rate of women (56% vs 26%, P < 0.001). No difference was noted between specialties on perceived support while pregnant and peripartum. Thirty percent of parent respondents reported thinking about leaving medical training after having children given family stressors. Statistical difference in thoughts of leaving medicine overall between females (46%) and males (17.6%; P = 0.0238).
Conclusions
Men and women need support as they navigate becoming parents at a naturally stressful transition period. Females consider leaving medicine at twice the rate of males after becoming parents. Our institution and other ACGME programs need greater transparency and consistent leave practices that reflect changing times.

AB  - Many companies have pursued innovation to obtain a competitive edge. Thus, educational reform focuses mainly on training creative students. This study adopted the concept of an affiliated network of projects to investigate how project embeddedness influences project team creativity. This work surveys 60 projects in a Management Information Systems Department of a University. Validity of the specific study hypotheses is tested by using moderate hierarchical regression analysis to determine how project embeddedness affects project team creativity and assess how the team innovation climate moderates the relationships between project embeddedness and project team creativity. Analytical results indicate a positive association between structural embeddedness and project team creativity, a negative relationship between positional embeddedness and project team creativity, and a positive influence of team innovation climate on the relationships between network embeddedness and project team creativity. An attempt is also made to understand the role of positional embeddedness by classifying the interactions based on the content of interactions. According to those results, positional embeddedness is positively related to project team creativity during problem–identification interaction; during solution–design interaction, positional embeddedness is negatively related to project team creativity. Results of this study explain the phenomena of divergent thinking and convergent thinking during creative development.

AB  - Air traffic is exhibiting the characteristics of large flow, strong coupling, and high time variation. Therefore, the complex network of air traffic is more vulnerable to disturbances. When it is disturbed, the failure of some nodes spreads through dependency relationships in the network, resulting in cascade failure. In the event of a cascade failure, the network may quickly collapse until it is paralyzed, with widespread delays and flight cancellations. The current flow management and deployment methods still remain in the control-oriented stage, which is mainly completed by air traffic controls (ATCs), and lack of accurate flow adjustment and effective utilization of capacity. The whole air traffic system and its peripheral factors are intricate, so human and social factors must be integrated into the control and decision-making of the system. Considering engineering and social factors such as operation environment, social environment, personnel, rules, equipment, and information processing, we analyse the air traffic in a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). To reflect the actual system behaviour rules, dynamic response, limit state, and so on, the corresponding computational experiment and comprehensive evaluation system are established. Based on neural networks and other technologies, a resource prediction scheme based on task demand is proposed for multi-dimensional resources such as airports, air routes, and ATC, to reduce the cost of system resource scheduling and improve resource utilization through resource prediction and adjustment. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed resource prediction algorithm is verified by theoretical analysis and simulation.

AB  - The percolation inception of CNT-polymer nanocomposites is studied considering the magneto-electric field effects on CNT subbands. The analytical model predicts the electrical conductivity where CNTs are modeled as slender rods with their geometric orientations as randomly distributed or aligned to transfer electrons at tunneling distance range. The tunneling effect takes into account the electron transmission between every linked pair of CNTs when evaluating electrical resistance. The subsequent CNT displacement computation and the resistance change comprise the other phase of the modeling approach. Piezoresistivity results of the analyses agree well with the experimental data when considering tunneling behavior in the percolation transition zone. The magnetic field enhances the field affected subbands and increases the electrical conductivity by enhancing the mobility of the charges. The results reveal that the efficiency of CNT network in transmitting charges is increased with higher aspect ratio CNTs that scaled the sensitivity to lower values.

AB  - Naturalistic decision-making research contrasts with traditional laboratory research along a number of dimensions. It is typically more observational, more focused on expert performance, and more attentive to the context in which decisions are made than laboratory studies. This approach helps to shore up some of the weaknesses of laboratory research by providing incentive to develop integrative theories of choice and examining strong methods of problem solving in a choice domain. This paper contrasts the strengths and weaknesses of laboratory and naturalistic approaches to decision making. Then, it explores strategies for using both of these approaches as well as mathematical and computational modeling to find the optimal tradeoff between internal and external validity for research projects.

AB  - Existing 3D skeleton-based action recognition approaches reach impressive performance by encoding handcrafted action features to image format and decoding by CNNs. However, such methods are limited in two ways: a) the handcrafted action features are difficult to handle challenging actions, and b) they generally require complex CNN models to improve action recognition accuracy, which usually occur heavy computational burden. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel AFE-CNN, which devotes to enhance the features of 3D skeleton-based actions to adapt to challenging actions. We propose feature enhance modules from key joint, bone vector, key frame and temporal perspectives, thus the AFE-CNN is more robust to camera views and body sizes variation, and significantly improve the recognition accuracy on challenging actions. Moreover, our AFE-CNN adopts a light-weight CNN model to decode images with action feature enhanced, which ensures a much lower computational burden than the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate the AFE-CNN on three benchmark skeleton-based action datasets: NTU RGB + D, NTU RGB + D 120, and UTKinect-Action3D, with extensive experimental results demonstrate our outstanding performance of AFE-CNN.

AB  - Discourse has always been at the heart of teaching. In more recent years, the mathematics education community has also turned its attention towards understanding the role of discourse in mathematics teaching and learning. Using earlier classifications of discourse, in this paper, we looked at three types of classrooms: classrooms that engage in high discourse, low discourse and a hybrid of the two. We aimed to understand how the elements of each discourse affected classroom learning, relationships between teachers and students, and participatory structures for students. Overall, our findings highlight the important relationship between cognitively demanding tasks and mathematical talk, and the power of discourse as a “thinking device” as opposed to mere conduit of knowledge. Our work also points to the under-theorized nature of hybrid discourse in mathematics classrooms, thereby providing some directions for pedagogy and further research.

AB  - TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) uses a pair of a positive ideal solution and a negative ideal solution as two reference points to rank a set of decision alternatives. In some situations, a trade-off of the distances to the two extreme reference points may not necessarily be meaningful. Inspired by the theory of three-way decision as thinking in threes (e.g., two opposite poles and a third middle), in this paper we generalize the classical TOPSIS by adding a third middle reference point. We use a common setting for investigating systematically reference-point-based TOPSIS-style multi-criteria decision-making methods. In particular, we examine three classes of approaches: a) a best reference point based model (i.e., B-TOPSIS) and a worst reference point based model (i.e., W-TOPSIS), b) the classical best and worst reference points based model (i.e., BW-TOPSIS), and c) a new best, mean, and worst reference points based model (i.e., BMW-TOPSIS). The three classes are one-way TOPSIS, two-way TOPSIS, and three-way TOPSIS, respectively. Based on one-way and two-way TOPSISs, we give two specific methods of three-way TOPSIS. The experimental results, compared with the existing TOPSIS methods, show that the BMW-TOPSIS model is feasible and effective.

AB  - There are many barriers and challenges associated with climate change communication focused on promoting community-based action for sustainable futures. Of particular interest is the challenge to embed community perspectives in a communication process of climate change solutions. In this paper we argue that 3D interactive simulations using design inquiry as a development process, can be an effective way of communicating climate change solutions and multiple community responses. People are more likely to engage with the challenges associated with complexity of climate change at the local level when their perspectives are integrated into viable and multiple pathways for action. Future scenarios of change processes situated in local experiences in compelling and interactive ways can be disseminated holistically by making links between scientific, social, political, economic and cultural elements. Design inquiry, as a research approach, integrates contextual knowledge into communication processes to aid imagining, re-thinking and reembodying viable pathways that explore the kinds of futures we collectively envision. This paper examines the contributions that design inquiry makes to climate change communication using an interactive simulation environment for designing futures. We discuss these ideas using the example of the Future Delta project, a virtual 3D environment that enables the exploration and simulation of multiple community-based climate change solutions in the Corporation of Delta, British Columbia.

AB  - Disassembly is the first practice in maintenance and recycling of industrial products. For productivity and efficiency, it is necessary to optimize its operative manners by reducing: change of tools and directions, process variation, wastes, etc. The simulation of Disassembly Plan (DP) allows the detection and identification of difficulties from the design stage in order to avoid them. This paper proposes a mathematical formulation which combines two principal indicators: the index of Quality (Qi) and the index of processing Time (Ti) in order to choose the best and feasible disassembly plan. The Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis method is implemented to compute Qi. Ti is obtained according to real manufacturing constraints (workspace, layout, tools, machines, etc.). Based on 5S method, the workspace can be optimized which directly impacts the timing index and contribute to the selection of the best DP. A gear box is used to show up the efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB  - Sketching is an established part of engineering culture. Sketches assist product designers during the creative stages of design and help them to develop inventions. Paper-and-pencil sketching is highly useful but lacks functionalities, mainly because it is disconnected from the rest of the (computer-aided) design process. However, CAS tools are not yet as usable as paper-and-pencil, although they provide full integration with the subsequent phases of the design processes (CAD, CAE, CAM, etc.) and other interesting functionalities. We desire computer-aided sketching (CAS) tools which furnish users with the sketching environment they require to make full use of their conceptual design and innovation talents, while providing full integration with the subsequent phases of the design processes (CAD, CAE, CAM, etc.). In this paper we discuss the importance of sketching in conceptual design, we review the current situation of engineering sketching, and we then analyze the main characteristics which a successful and fully integrated CAS tool should include. We consider CAS, not as a single problem, but as at least three: thinking, prescriptive and talking sketches require different approaches to functionality. Finally, we present the current state of the art in CAS tools by describing the main features and outstanding problems of our own applications.

AB  - We argue that recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of art (e.g., music, painting) pose a profound ontological threat to anthropocentric worldviews because they challenge one of the last frontiers of the human uniqueness narrative: artistic creativity. Four experiments (N = 1708), including a high-powered preregistered experiment, consistently reveal a pervasive bias against AI-made artworks and shed light on its psychological underpinnings. The same artwork is preferred less when labeled as AI-made (vs. human-made) because it is perceived as less creative and subsequently induces less awe, an emotional response typically associated with the aesthetic appreciation of art. These effects are more pronounced among people with stronger anthropocentric creativity beliefs (i.e., who believe that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic). Systematic depreciation of AI-made art (assignment of lower creative value, suppression of emotional reactions) appears to serve a shaken anthropocentric worldview whereby creativity is exclusively reserved for humans.

However, none was found that properly concerns the company's business model and its way of market interaction, in order to identify opportunities where the use of CPS could improve the performance. Therefore, this article proposes CPSD2: a CPS design and development methodology approach based on generic product design and development methods.

In this paper we go further and think that it is a first level driver in the configuration of our deepest perceptions and has a paramount influence on shaping our worldviews and metaphors, though this aspect goes unnoticed for most of the population. In this paper we analyze how metaphors take action in the characterization of technologies, mainly emerging technologies, and in their evolution, and furthermore the impact of technologies and metaphors on the way we perceive our daily life. We analyze metaphors underlying brain nature and artificial intelligence, raising the connections between them and showing how metaphors in one of these fields impact on the way we understand the other. This fact has important consequences, for instance it conditions the evolution of computational systems, and we propose two scenarios for this evolution. This paper relies on the conceptual model and classification of metaphors proposed by Lakoff and Johnson in “Metaphors we live by”, from the orientational metaphors that show values and mantras, to the deepest structural metaphors that are reconfiguring how life is conceived. It also relies on CLA (Causal Layered Analysis) and to its reference book “CLA 2.0” in order to insert this analysis in a wider and future oriented framework and to analyze scenarios.

AB  - Background
Psychiatry aspires to the molecular understanding of its disorders and, with that knowledge, to precision medicine. Research supporting such goals in the dimension of psychosis has been compromised, in part, by using phenomenology alone to estimate disease entities. To this end, we are proponents of a deep phenotyping approach in psychosis, using computational strategies to discover the most informative phenotypic fingerprint as a promising strategy to uncover mechanisms in psychosis.
Methods
Doing this, the Bipolar–Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) has used biomarkers to identify distinct subtypes of psychosis with replicable biomarker characteristics. While we have presented these entities as relevant, their potential utility in clinical practice has not yet been demonstrated.
Results
Here we carried out an analysis of clinical features that characterize biotypes. We found that biotypes have unique and defining clinical characteristics that could be used as initial screens in the clinical and research settings. Differences in these clinical features appear to be consistent with biotype biomarker profiles, indicating a link between biological features and clinical presentation. Clinical features associated with biotypes differ from those associated with DSM diagnoses, indicating that biotypes and DSM syndromes are not redundant and are likely to yield different treatment predictions. We highlight 3 predictions based on biotype that are derived from individual biomarker features and cannot be obtained from DSM psychosis syndromes.
Conclusions
In the future, biotypes may prove to be useful for targeting distinct molecular, circuit, cognitive, and psychosocial therapies for improved functional outcomes.

AB  - Resources and waste strategies have recently seen a shift in focus from weight-based recycling targets to impact-driven policies. To support this transition, numerous decision-support tools were developed to help identify waste streams with the highest impacts. However, the majority of these tools focus solely on greenhouse gas emissions and show a narrow picture of the overall environmental impacts. Furthermore, they cover burdens associated with direct waste management activities and hence fall short when it comes to highlighting the substantial benefits that can be achieved by preventing waste in the first place. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the necessity to adopt impact-based targets that go beyond estimating the greenhouse gas emissions of waste and highlights the substantial benefits of waste reduction and prevention. Using a state-of-the-art waste environmental footprint tool, the paper quantifies the overall environmental impacts of Scotland's household waste and shows how targeting ‘heavy’ materials does not necessarily have the highest overall environmental benefit. Results show that embodied environmental impacts of household waste dominate the total environmental burdens, contributing more than 90% to the whole life cycle impacts, and hence policymakers should prioritise interventions that aim at waste reduction and prevention. Moreover, our analysis shows that food and textile wastes are high-priority materials in Scotland, with the largest contribution to overall environmental burdens; up to 42% and 30%, respectively. Considering the overall environmental impacts of specific waste materials will enable policymakers to develop more granular and targeted interventions to accelerate our transition to a sustainable circular economy.

AB  - Urban planning and morphology have relied on analytical cartography and visual communication tools for centuries to illustrate spatial patterns, conceptualize proposed designs, compare alternatives, and engage the public. Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric. The age of ubiquitous urban data and computational toolkits opens up a new era of worldwide urban form analysis from integrated quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

A detailed study is presented, of the philosophy underpinning virtual testing schemes: highlighting the structure, challenges and opportunities posed by a virtual testing strategy compared with traditional laboratory experiments. The virtual testing process has been discussed from atomistic to macrostructural length scales of analyses. Several implementations of virtual testing frameworks for diverse categories of materials are also presented, with particular emphasis on composites, cellular materials and biomaterials (collectively described as heterogeneous systems, in this context). The robustness of virtual frameworks for prediction of the constitutive behaviour of these materials is discussed. The paper also considers the current thinking on developing virtual laboratories in relation to availability of computational resources as well as the development of multi-scale material model algorithms. In conclusion, the paper highlights the challenges facing developments of future virtual testing frameworks. This review represents a comprehensive documentation of the state of knowledge on virtual testing from microscale to macroscale length scales for heterogeneous materials across constitutive responses from elastic to damage regimes.

AB  - This study is concerned with the development of the axiomatic design (AD) method under an interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment and its application in evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chains. Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD. The proposed model is used to prioritize blockchain deployment projects in a real-life case study.

AB  - Creativity is at the heart of the 21st century educational work. Learner’ creativity or learner’s creative thinking skills are among the most important skills they need to be prepared for the knowledge society. The rapid development of technology in the modern era sheds light on the place and importance of creativity in education. Technology also has brought change in the way the students learn (collaboration strategy) and recently the computer-based instruction associated with electrical technologies has been a popular way of instruction that learning is no longer confined to classrooms (distance learning). Also in the case of the students if they want to take effective advantage of technology, they have to use the constructivist and cognitive skills (psychological learning theory). Recently education experts have tried to show how a distance instructional can be designed. The main question of this paper is what effects the distance instructional design based on the views of constructivism and cognitivism have on the learners’ creativity.The definition of distance education (e-learning), the instruction design based on constructivist view and its function in education and distance learning (e-learning), the instruction design based on cognitive view and its function in education and distance learning (e-learning), the factors affecting the creativity development and accommodation (comparison) the characteristics of the instructural context, and the impact of the appropriate learning on the creativity development according to these settings are among the other main points of this review.

AB  - Population dynamics is influenced by between-individual variability. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is an appealing framework for assessing such a variability, yet DEB parameters have rarely been estimated at the individual level. Bayesian hierarchical models show promise for inferring individual variability in DEB parameters, thought computational challenges have limited their use due to the need to solve differential equations. Timely, Stan has emerged as a general-purpose statistical tool for fitting dynamic models. This paper introduces an analytical strategy using Bayesian parametric inference and hierarchical modelling to estimate individual-specific DEB parameters. Two biologically relevant DEB parameters were successfully estimated for 69 Gilt-head breams (Sparus aurata) with up to 11 measures of length and wet weight each. The estimated between-individual variability in these two DEB parameters explained well the observed patterns in length and weight at between- and within-individual levels. Moreover, data-simulation experiments highlighted the potential and limitations of our approach, suggesting that improved data collection could enable to increase precision and the number of DEB parameters that can be estimated at the individual level. This strategy can better represent between-individual variability in DEB parameters, which ultimately may improve forecasting of population dynamics after integrating DEB into population models.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is described as a severe form of the neural disorder that collectively degenerate the essential cognitive activities of a human being (thinking, memory retention, etc.,) in particular among the elderly individuals and eventually results in death. In addition to the adverse ill-health effects on the patients, AD imposes paramount responsibility and burden on the caretakers too. Several genetic and pathological traits and non-invasive diagnostic strategies are being vigorously investigated and explored to discover the early onset of this debilitating disease. The prognosis of AD assumes importance, as the deterioration of health due to its progression may be either contained or controlled. Moreover, early and accurate detection of AD helps medical practitioners to prescribe case-specific medical treatment procedure. Among the popular machine learning algorithms, decision tree technique is widely used for classification/prediction, due to its accuracy and speed.This research article presents a novel decision tree-based classification technique, with optimum hyper parametertuning, that is ideally suitable for AD diagnosis, even at the early stages of development. The performance of this newly proposed Decision Tree Classifier with Hyper Parameters Tuning (DTC-HPT) is validated on the Open Access Imaging Studies Series (OASIS) dataset that contains patients’ data on the different stages of AD. The DTC-HPT is designed with the primary objective to classify the nature of brain abnormality using the most relevantand potentially significant data attributes/parameters. The efficiency of DTC-HPT on AD classification is measured as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The correctness of AD classification by DTC-HPTwith an average accuracy of 99.10% endorse that this classification technique can be used for AD detection on the AD clinical datasets.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, negative symptoms, and disorganized thinking. There has been a multitude of studies assessing reasoning performance in schizophrenia patients by using various reasoning tasks. Methods: We reviewed the existing literature using the following reasoning tasks in schizophrenia and related disorders: Transitive Inferences, Wason Card Selection, conditional reasoning, syllogisms, and other related tasks. Results: Some deductive reasoning studies have reported conflicting results where schizophrenia patients sometimes, outperform or underperform healthy controls. These findings are related to the plausibility, emotional content of logical sentences used in these studies. Importantly, data show that performance in deductive reasoning tasks is impacted by emotional and cognitive processes, such as theory of mind and working memory. However, neural studies report different brain mechanisms underlying different deductive reasoning task performance. Conclusions: Overall, there are differences in the findings of reasoning tasks which should be investigated in future studies as it will contribute towards an accurate understanding of reasoning processes in schizophrenia spectrum and related disorders.

AB  - This paper explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), on diagnosing and treating hearing loss, which affects over 5% of the global population across all ages and demographics. AI encompasses various applications, from natural language processing models like ChatGPT to image recognition systems; however, this paper focuses on ML, a subfield of AI that can revolutionize audiology by enhancing early detection, formulating personalized rehabilitation plans, and integrating electronic health records for streamlined patient care. The integration of ML into audiometry, termed "computational audiology," allows for automated, accurate hearing tests. AI algorithms can process vast data sets, provide detailed audiograms, and facilitate early detection of hearing impairments. Research shows ML's effectiveness in classifying audiograms, conducting automated audiometry, and predicting hearing loss based on noise exposure and genetics. These advancements suggest that AI can make audiological diagnostics and treatment more accessible and efficient. The future of audiology lies in the seamless integration of AI technologies. Collaborative efforts between audiologists, AI experts, and individuals with hearing loss are essential to overcome challenges and leverage AI's full potential. Continued research and development will enhance AI applications in audiology, improving patient outcomes and quality of life worldwide.

AB  - Summary
Objective
This article delineates a relatively unknown path in the history of medical philosophy and medical diagnosis. It is concerned with the phenomenon of vagueness in the physician's “style of thinking” and with the use of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations with a view to create a model of such reasoning when physicians make a diagnosis. It represents specific features of medical ways of thinking that were mentioned by the Polish physician and philosopher Ludwik Fleck in 1926. The paper links Lotfi Zadeh's work on system theory before the age of fuzzy sets with system-theory concepts in medical philosophy that were introduced by the philosopher Mario Bunge, and with the fuzzy-theoretical analysis of the notions of health, illness, and disease by the Iranian-German physician and philosopher Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh.
Material
Some proposals to apply fuzzy sets in medicine were based on a suggestion made by Zadeh: symptoms and diseases are fuzzy in nature and fuzzy sets are feasible to represent these entity classes of medical knowledge. Yet other attempts to use fuzzy sets in medicine were self-contained. The use of this approach contributed to medical decision-making and the development of computer-assisted diagnosis in medicine.
Conclusion
With regard to medical philosophy, decision-making, and diagnosis; the framework of fuzzy sets, systems, and relations is very useful to deal with the absence of sharp boundaries of the sets of symptoms, diagnoses, and phenomena of diseases. The foundations of reasoning and computer assistance in medicine were the result of a rapid accumulation of data from medical research. This explosion of knowledge in medicine gave rise to the speculation that computers could be used for the medical diagnosis. Medicine became, to a certain extent, a quantitative science. In the second half of the 20th century medical knowledge started to be stored in computer systems. To assist physicians in medical decision-making and patient care, medical expert systems using the theory of fuzzy sets and relations (such as the Viennese “fuzzy version” of the Computer-Assisted Diagnostic System, Cadiag, which was developed at the end of the 1970s) were constructed. The development of fuzzy relations in medicine and their application in computer-assisted diagnosis show that this fuzzy approach is a framework to deal with the “fuzzy mode of thinking” in medicine.

AB  - Immunology has come a long way, from its early religious beginnings thousands of years ago, to the explosion of immunological data in the 21st century. Thanks to discoveries in immunology, our world has seen tremendous progress in how we understand and treat disease. However, a lot of unmet clinical needs remain, which require focused, real-time collaboration at the clinical and scientific research forefronts. Moreover, the current exponential growth in the generation of research data makes it impossible to handle, analyze, visualize, and interpret such data without the use of advanced computational tools. We think immunoinformatics- a discipline at the intersection of immunology and computer science- will greatly increase efficiency in research productivity and disease treatment. This perspective paper aims to emphasize the role of immunoinformatics toward pushing the boundaries of immunology research. It will also illustrate its clinical applications, including disease prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, monitoring, as well as in drug discovery. We believe informatics approaches will be implemented increasingly more frequently in research. Thus, here we also discuss a set of fundamental prerequisites to facilitate the efficient and ethical integration of informatics in research and ensure immunological advancements provide maximum benefits to society.

An evaluative analytical framework has been utilized to meet this goal. Results show that the Institute has pursued a ‘glocalization’; thinking globally and acting locally approach in designing the programme. This approach aims at providing learners with ‘cutting-edge’ skills that will enhance their chances for employment at the local as well as regional markets. What are the advantages of this approach? And how can the Institute preserve its ‘distinctive research’ positioning that it has gained over the years, at the same time, being able to provide ‘world-class’ educational programmes?

AB  - Ideation is a source of innovation and creativity, and is commonly used in early stages of engineering design processes. This paper proposes an integrated approach for enhancing design ideation by applying artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. This approach consists of two models, a semantic ideation network and a visual concepts combination model, which provide inspiration semantically and visually based on computational creativity theory. The semantic ideation network aims to provoke new ideas by mining potential knowledge connections across multiple knowledge domains, and this was achieved by applying “step-forward” and “path-track” algorithms which assist in exploring forward given a concept and in tracking back the paths going from a departure concept through a destination concept. In the visual concepts combination model, a generative adversarial networks model is proposed for generating images which synthesize two distinct concepts. An implementation of these two models was developed and tested in a design case study, which indicated that the proposed approach is able to not only generate a variety of cross-domain concept associations but also advance the ideation process quickly and easily in terms of quantity and novelty.

Children solved multidigit subtraction problems in one choice condition, in which they were free to choose between direct subtraction and indirect addition, and in two no-choice conditions, in which they had to use either direct subtraction or indirect addition. Furthermore, children were randomly assigned to mental computation, written computation, or free choice between mental and written computation. One third of the children adaptively switched their strategy according to the number characteristics of the problems, whereas the remaining children consistently used the same strategy. The likelihood to adaptively switch strategies decreased when written computation was allowed or required, compared to mandatory mental computation. On average, children were adaptive to their own speed differences but not to the accuracy differences between the strategies.

AB  - Since the outbreak of COVID-19, buildings that provide improved performance have aroused extensive discussion. Nowadays, the connotation of healthy building is becoming complex, performance metrics for healthy buildings vary significantly from different regions in the world and there may be information asymmetry among stakeholders. Consequently, building health performance cannot be effectively achieved. However, previous studies have launched extensive reviews on green building, and there remains a lack of comprehensive and systematic reviews on healthy buildings. To address the above issues, therefore, this research aims to (1) conduct a thorough review of healthy building research and reveal its nature; and (2) identify the current research gaps and propose possible future research directions. Content analysis using NVivo were applied to review 238 relevant publications. A DNA framework of healthy buildings, which clarifies the characteristics, triggers, guides and actions, was then constructed for better understanding of the nature of them. Subsequently, the application of DNA framework and the directions of future research were discussed. Six future research directions were finally recommended, including life-cycle thinking, standard systems improvement, policies & regulations, awareness increase, healthy building examination, and multidisciplinary integration. This research differs from previous ones because it painted a panorama of previous healthy building research. Findings of this research contribute to reveal knowledge map of healthy buildings, guide researchers to fill existing knowledge gaps, provide a standardized platform for healthy building stakeholders, and promote high-quality development of healthy buildings.

This respectful attitude will guide the design of higher-quality models and facilitate the use of models in modern applications such as engineering and manipulating microbial metabolism by synthetic biology.

AB  - We study conformance checking for timed models, that is, process models that consider both the sequence of events that occur, as well as the timestamps at which each event is recorded. Time-aware process mining is a growing subfield of research, and as tools that seek to discover timing-related properties in processes develop, so does the need for conformance-checking techniques that can tackle time constraints and provide insightful quality measures for time-aware process models. One of the most useful conformance artefacts is the alignment, that is, finding the minimal changes necessary to correct a new observation to conform to a process model. In this paper, we extend the notion of timed distance from a previous work where an edit on an event’s timestamp came in two types, depending on whether or not it would propagate to its successors. Here, these different types of edits have a weighted cost each, and the ratio of their costs is denoted by α. We then solve the purely timed alignment problem in this setting for a large class of these weighted distances (corresponding to α∈{1}∪[2,∞)). For these distances, we provide linear time algorithms for both distance computation and alignment on models with sequential causal processes.

AB  - Decomposed fuzzy sets (DFSs) are one of the latest extensions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are introduced to express vague and imprecise information to be used in multi-criteria decision-making. DFSs represent the human thinking structure in a multidirectional way, and they enable it through functional and dysfunctional judgments. However, DFSs cannot completely represent the entire human mindset as they are incapable of capturing reliability information, as it is in the other extensions, and this inability may cause wrong decisions to be given. To handle this problem, decomposed Z-fuzzy numbers, which are the integrated DFSs with reliability information provided by Z-fuzzy numbers, are introduced to model functional and dysfunctional judgments for taking the consistency of decision makers into account. Collecting judgments with both their fuzzy restrictions and fuzzy reliabilities from decision makers based on functional and dysfunctional questions provide more consistent and reliable judgments in the practice. Subsequently, a new decomposed Z-fuzzy linguistic scale and defuzzification formula are introduced to reach a final solution. Then, decomposed Z-fuzzy TOPSIS method is developed. Finally, we analyze the effect of the reliability parameter on the given decisions and present a comparative analysis with crisp TOPSIS method by an application of transfer center location selection for a private cargo company in Marmara Region of Turkey.

This chapter will give insights into the historical shaping of the very peculiar notion of a nature without any future. We will retrace some of its roots in the secularization of Christian apocalypse, Newtonian physics and Linnean classification – while at the same time, Cartesian, Kantian and Hegelian philosophies perceived humans as subjects of reason, emancipation and civilization. We will revisit the way that, in the 19th Century, the Darwinian theory of evolution and, more recently, the development of geophysics, both contributed in the thinking of nature itself as able to instigate and create new futures.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are proving to be very useful in many fields, especially chemistry and biology, because of their amazing capabilities. Biomolecular data is often represented sequentially, much like textual data used to train LLMs. However, developing LLMs from scratch requires a substantial amount of data and computational resources, which may not be feasible for most researchers. A more workable solution to this problem is to change the inputs or parameters so that the previously trained general LLMs can pick up the specific knowledge needed for biomolecular analysis. These adaption strategies lower the amount of data and hardware needed, providing a more affordable option. This review provides the introduction of two popular LLM adaptation techniques: fine-tuning and prompt engineering, along with their uses in the analysis of molecules, proteins, and genes. A thorough overview of current common datasets and pre-trained models is also provided. This review outlines the possible advantages and difficulties of LLMs for biomolecular analysis, opening the door for chemists and biologists to effectively utilize LLMs in their future studies.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter explains language as a distinctive human trait characterized by flexibility and creativity of human brains. Language is the sole symbol of communication and representation of individuality and sociality. The role of language on human thinking is to define the cultural and behavioral novelties of human thoughts. Lately, language is going through pendulum dynamics from past 30 years because the communicative approaches are becoming hegemonic. There has been a lot of new evidence to support the constitutive approach and its becoming mainstream, however, the modern critics of the cognitive view of language react in a paradoxical manner and do not support a cognitive role of language. This chapter aims at providing a defined role of language in human cognition to analyze the different ways, in which the relation between language and cognition has been conceived, to review the evidence amassed in recent years on this relationship, and to conclude multiple ways to conceive of the relationship at its best accounts for the facts.

AB  - Brain activity is a biological signal with unique characteristics that can determine important patterns for recording and processing. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most used signal because it measures brain electrical activity, offering greater resolution and data accuracy. When associated to brain activities in user-computer interactions, it can provide information that allows analyzing adequacy and user satisfaction. Thus, the objective of this paper is to identify works that specify which information on electroencephalography assessment may be used to compose an analysis of its interactions with conversational systems. The delimited that the research problems are: (1) What information about user experience by electroencephalography can be used to compose an analysis of their interactions with conversational systems? (2) What techniques are used to present user experience information by EEG to individuals? Based on the Systematic Review method, seven studies were identified that examined commercial EEG devices for UX assessment between 2011 and 2022. The current study found that multiple emotional stimuli were used and reported. The most popular technique among researchers is event induced emotional stimulation, in which participants passively perceive emotional stimuli such as images, music and videos to evoke certain emotions.

AB  - According to Aby Warburg, the aesthetic experience is informed by a pendulum-like movement of the observer's mind that allows him to immerse as well as to take distance from the artwork's composing elements. To account for Warburg's definition, we are proposing embodied simulation and associative processing as constitutive mechanisms of this pendulum-like movement within the aesthetic experience that enable the observer to relate to the displayed artistic material within aesthetic spaces. Furthermore, we suggest that associative processing elicits constructive memory processes that permit the development of a knowledge within which the objects of art become part of memory networks, potentially informing future ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in real-world situations, as an individual or collectively.

AB  - Introduction
During the decision-making process, physicians rely on heuristics that consist of simple, useful procedures for solving problems, intuitive shortcuts that produce reliable decisions based on limited information. In clinical situations characterized by a high degree of uncertainty such as those encountered in orthodontics, cognitive biases and judgment errors related to heuristics are not uncommon. This study aimed at promoting trust in the effective interface between the intuitive reasoning of the orthodontic practitioner and the computational heuristics emerging from simple statistical models.
Methods
We propose an integrative model based on the interaction between clinical reasoning and 2 computational tools, cluster analysis and fast-and-frugal trees, to extract a structured craniofacial representation of untreated subjects with Class III malocclusion and to forecast the worsening of the malocclusion over time.
Results
Cluster analysis of cephalometric values from 144 growing subjects with Class III malocclusion followed longitudinally (T1: mean age, 10.2 ± 1.9 years; T2: mean age, 13.8 ± 2.7 years) produced 3 morphologic subgroups with predominant sagittal, vertical, and slight maxillomandibular imbalances. Fast-and-frugal trees applied to different subgroups extracted heuristics that improved the prediction of key features associated with adverse craniofacial growth.
Conclusions
Provided that cephalometric values are placed in the appropriate framework, the matching between simple and fast computational approaches and clinical reasoning could help the intuitive logic, perception, and cognitive inferences of orthodontic practitioners on the outcome of patients affected by Class III disharmony, decreasing errors associated with flawed judgments and improving the accuracy of decision making.

In this chapter, we precisely develop the latter idea to provide a didactic and up-to-date overview of some major research tracks where these two fields can collaborate and benefit each other. We specifically articulate contents around two complementary points-of-view on the potential benefits of one field to the other. For biophysical modelling, we focused on accelerating computations, estimating unobservable parameters and examining complex outputs; for machine learning, we laid stress on adding physiologically relevant knowledge and generating synthetic data for training and validation. Throughout this review, we detail specific questions of relevance with examples mostly in the context of computational cardiology, which is our field of interest, and encourage further interaction between these two areas of active research.

AB  - In this paper, a model of community formation and organizational complexity is presented, focusing on the fundamental role of social interactions and information transmission for the development of complex social organisation. The model combines several approaches in complex systems thinking which has garnered increasing attention in archaeology. It is then outlined how this conceptual model can be applied in archaeology. In the absence of direct observations of constituent social interactions, archaeologists study the past through material remnants found in the archaeological record. People used their material surroundings to shape, structure and guide social interactions and practices in various ways. The presented framework shows how dynamics of social organisation and community formation can be inferred from these material remains. The model is applied on a case study of two communities, Sagalassos and Düzen Tepe, located in southwestern Anatolia during late Achaemenid to middle Hellenistic times (fifth to second centuries BCE). It is suggested that constituent interactions and practices can be linked to the markedly different forms of organizational structures and material surroundings attested in both communities. The case study illustrates how the presented model can help understand trajectories of socio-political structures and organizational complexity on a community level.

AB  - Many studies describe leadership as a dynamic process. However, few examine the passage of time as a critical dimension of that dynamism. This article illuminates this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review of empirical studies on temporal effects of leadership to identify if and how time has been considered as a factor. After synthesizing key findings from the review, the article discusses methodological implications. We propose that a computational science approach, particularly agent-based modeling, is a fruitful path for future leadership research. This article contributes to leadership scholarship by shedding light on a missing variable (time) and offering a novel way to investigate the temporal, dynamic, emergent, and recursive aspects of leadership. We demonstrate the usefulness of agent-based modeling with an example of leader-member exchange relationship development.

AB  - This study provides an overview of the recent advances in simulation techniques applied to fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, focusing on analyzing their mechanical properties and applications. FRP composites have gained significant attention in various industries due to their excellent mechanical properties, lightweight nature, and corrosion resistance. Simulating the behavior of FRP composites allows researchers and engineers to optimize their design, understand their mechanical performance, and predict their response under different loading conditions. This study explores different theoretical models for predicting the mechanical properties of composites. This study also acknowledges the challenges of characterizing these heterogeneous materials, making computational techniques such as finite element analysis indispensable for accurate predictions. In addition, simulated mechanical properties of composites with varying fibers and matrices are explored and compared with experimental results. Furthermore, the applications of simulation in different industries for characterizing FRP composites are discussed.

AB  - The objective of the work in this paper is to computationally tackle a range of problems in hyperbolic conservation laws, which is an interesting branch of computational fluid dynamics. For the simulation of issues in hyperbolic conservation laws, this work explores the concept of fuzzy logic-based operators. This research presents a unique mixture of fuzzy sets and logic with a new branch of conservation laws from fluid dynamics. The approach considers a computational procedure based on the reconstruction of several high-order numerical methods termed as flux-limited methods using some fuzzy logic operators. With the aid of fuzzy modifiers, these flux limiters are further modified. This approach results in improved convergence of approximations and maintains the problem’s basic properties to be solved. Additionally, to ensure improved results, modified flux-limited methods are imposed on some famous test problems. The application results are provided wherever required. The work has demonstrated that it is possible to use such technique and apply it to complex areas of computational fluid dynamics to produce a more straightforward approach to studying other topics like flux-limited methods and hence opens up an exciting gateway for future work.

A new approach to abnormal situations with regard for the heuristic regularities of human-operator thinking process is proposed. The regularities are revealed on basis of recording the motions of the human-operator eyes over the information field of the control board and processing the experimental data obtained. For data processing, a probability theoretical approach is utilized. Such an approach is based on involving the notion of consistency of measures of dependence of random variables. Within the approach, a set of the so called information correlations has been proposed to serve as a quantitative performance index of human-operator skills.

AB  - Many concepts that are central to chemical language and thought emerge from the wealth of chemists’ historical experience and cannot be precisely defined mathematically from the underlying physics. In such cases, it is useful to take an axiomatic approach: list the chemical, mathematical and computational properties that one desires for a concept to possess, and then find the rigorous (and, if possible, elegant) mathematical formulation of the concept that satisfies those desiderata. This mathematical formulation is most useful if it relies on fundamental quantities—quantum-mechanical observables, reduced density matrices, or the N-electron wavefunction—rather than method-dependent quantities (e.g., orbitals) that are not defined for some computational approaches to the molecular electronic structure problem. This ensures that the pursuit of chemical intuition does not lead one too far from the underlying physics. It also ensures that one can interpret the results of any computational method, even methods (e.g., quantum Monte Carlo) that make no reference to any molecular-orbital or valence-bond model.

This paper uses multi-ontology sense making framework developed by Snowden. The four described situation illustrate the use of this framework. Firstly, a project core team create a project plan –timetable and cost estimate, that is supposed to be followed (rules and order) when making investment decision. Secondly, a project core team uses the plan but since the plan cannot be followed due to an unexpected situation the team changes the plan by calculating an optimal solution. In other words the team uses heuristic thinking when they change the rule (heuristics and order). Thirdly, the design group guides the design process by rules to get information for designing new facilities (rules and un-order). Fourthly, there are situations when the stakeholders have different kind of opinions in crisis and team cannot follow the preset orderly way of working (heuristics and un-order).

In 2019, Google has announced that they have reached quantum supremacy with their quantum computer Sycamore using a 53 qubits processor. On November 2021, IBM also announced that they have built a quantum computer with the highest number of 127 qubits and revealed their ambitious goal of building a 1000 qubits processor by 2023. According to these two giants of the quantum computing field, such a machine can perform an astronomical quantity of calculations significantly faster than any other conventional computer. This technology could be a real revolution in many fields such as computing, artificial intelligence, medicine, chemistry, banking, and experimental techniques, …etc. Since this technology is still in its infancy in hardware and software, its progress may be slow. However, many working in the field predict that 2,000 to 5,000 quantum computers of a first generation will be operational by 2030, but quantum computers needed to deal with more complex problems may not exist until 2035 or beyond. In this paper, we will go over some of the basic aspects of a quantum computer, in particular the concept of the qubit or the quantum bit and the quantum computer itself. Then we will see how a quantum computer can effectively speed up the processing of large images, reduce the amount of memory needed for computation and storage and even, strengthen the security of information systems. Lastly, we will present and discuss a real hardware implementation of the well-known quantum edge detection, as well as a spy hunter simulation.

AB  - In this study, we present a novel scale for measuring social media information literacy (SMIL) that encompasses six sub-dimensions: navigation, curation, appraisal, comprehension, creation, and interaction. We also examine antecedents of SMIL, its association with information overload, and possible indirect consequences such as news avoidance and conspiracy thinking. Relying on a two-wave panel dataset (n = 901), we first used factor analysis to test the proposed measurement. The results showed that the six dimensions were empirically distinct and loaded on a higher order SMIL factor. In a second step, we explored antecedents and outcomes of SMIL and its sub-dimensions. We found that not age, but education and frequency of social media use were positively associated with gains in SMIL. Furthermore, SMIL was associated with a decrease in information overload. Information overload, in turn, was associated with a decrease in news avoidance and an increase in conspiracy mentality. Taken together, our results lend support that SMIL may support positive civic outcomes by its potential role in lowering information overload. Helping citizens to acquire SMIL may be one valuable measure to foster democratic resilience.

AB  - Biologically inspired computation has been recently used with mathematical models towards the design of new synthetic organisms. In this work, we use Pareto optimality to optimize these organisms in a multi-objective fashion. We infer the best knockout strategies to perform specific tasks in bacteria, which involve concurrent maximization/minimization of multiple functions (codomain) and optimization of several decision variables (domain). Furthermore, we propose and exploit a mapping between the metabolism and a register machine. We show that optimized bacteria have computational capability and act as molecular Turing machines programmed using a Pareto optimal solution. Finally, we investigate communication between bacteria as a means to evaluate their computational capability. We report that the density and gradient of the Pareto curve are useful tools to compare models and understand their structure, while modelling organisms as computers proves useful to carry out computation using biological machines with specific input–output conditions, as well as to estimate the bacterial computational effort for specific tasks.

AB  - There are extensive concerns pertaining to the idea that students do not develop sufficient communication abilities in algebra and in mathematics more generally. This problem is at least partially related to their algebraic thinking. Although teaching should give students the opportunity to develop their ability to communicate, there are limited research insights as to why some forms of communication work better than others, and how and why instruction influences such communication. Two case studies are reported on in this article. The analysis of the opportunity to communicate was grounded in variation theory. Differences between focused aspects and discerned aspects of the object of learning are described. The results show that the coordination between the aspects focused on by the teacher and discerned by the students provides students with the opportunity to successfully communicate the content in algebra. In addition, the structure of the lesson influences the opportunity to communicate aspects of the content.

AB  - Humans often face decisions where little is known about the choice options. Gathering information prior to making a choice is an important strategy to improve decision making under uncertainty. This is of particular importance during childhood and adolescence, when knowledge about the world is still limited. To examine how much information youths gather, we asked 107 children (8–9 years, N = 30), early (12–13 years, N = 41) and late adolescents (16–17 years, N = 36) to perform an information sampling task. We find that children gather significantly more information before making a decision compared to adolescents, but only if it does not come with explicit costs. Using computational modelling, we find that this is because children have reduced subjective costs for gathering information. Our findings thus demonstrate how children overcome their limited knowledge and neurocognitive constraints by deploying excessive information gathering, a developmental feature that could inform aberrant information gathering in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - All physical, natural, biological and socio-economic systems – also referred to as complex systems - have system-level properties that result from the interactions between their components. In most cases it is not possible to determine the complete system-level properties with the current state of our knowledge. Where there are system-level properties, the uncoupled form of those properties is the eigen-system consisting of system eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, even though at the present we are not able to determine them through modelling or observation. All systems operate in equilibrium states; small perturbations cause small changes. While these systems normally undergo gradual changes in their system-level properties, they can also undergo sudden transitions to new equilibrium states. New insights into these important transitions are proposed in this paper. In some mechanical systems transition occur when the smallest system eigenvalue goes to zero. It is proposed that the same principles apply to all systems. Transitions in all systems occur when at least one system eigenvalue goes to zero. Generalization of these principles to all systems will encourage new ways of thinking about systems and will suggest new research directions in studying these important major transitions, potentially leading to reliable methods for predicting their onset.

AB  - Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment new categories with only a small number of annotated images. Previous methods mainly focused on exploiting the pixel-level correlation between the support image and the query image, combined with attention-based methods, resulting in significant advancements. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to enhance few-shot segmentation. We identify that utilizing the bilinear interpolation method to downsample the mask leads to the loss of fine-grained information from the target features. To address this issue, we propose a Smooth Downsampling Mask (SDM) method. The SDM method is designed to retain more effective target semantic features by employing a cascaded downsampling approach with a smooth kernel for mask processing. Additionally, we propose a label smoothing loss to further enhance the performance, which provides direct guidance for low-resolution feature map optimization. Both methods can be used as plug-and-play modules for existing methods. Notably, our proposed method does not involve additional learnable parameters and is computationally efficient, thus achieving painless gains. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we take three publicly available models as baselines and conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i and FSS-1000, and achieve considerable improvement.

AB  - Background
Manual contouring for radiation therapy planning remains the most laborious and time consuming part in the radiation therapy workflow. Particularly for cervical cancer, this task is complicated by the complex female pelvic anatomy and the concomitant dependence on 18F-labeled Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Using deep learning, we propose a new auto-contouring method for FDG-PET/MR based cervical cancer radiation therapy by combining the high level anatomical topography and radiological properties, to the low-level pixel wise deep-learning based semantic segmentation.
Materials/methods
The proposed method: 1) takes advantage of PET data and left/right anatomical symmetry, creating sub-volumes that are centered on the structures to be contoured. 2) Uses a 3D shallow U-Net (sU-Net) model with an encoder depth of 2.3) Applies the successive training of 3 consecutive sU-Nets in a feed forward strategy. 4) Employs, instead of the usual generalized dice loss function (GDL), a patch dice loss function (PDL) that takes into account the Dice similarity index (DSI) at the level of each training patch. Experimental analysis was conducted on a set of 13 PET/MR images was using a leave-one-out strategy.
Results
Despite the limited data availability, 5 anatomical structures - the gross tumor volume, bladder, anorectum, and bilateral femurs - were accurately (DSI ​= ​0.78), rapidly (1.9 ​s/structure), and automatically delineated by our algorithm. Overall, PDL achieved a better performance than GDL and DSI was higher for organs at risk (OARs) with solid tissue (e.g. femurs) than for OARs with air-filled soft tissues (e.g. anorectum).
Conclusion
The presented workflow successfully addresses the challenge of auto-contouring in FDG-PET/MR based cervical cancer. It is expected to expedite the cervical cancer radiation therapy workflow in both, conventional and adaptive radiation therapy settings.

AB  - Process Industry is one of the leading sectors of the world economy, characterized however by intense environmental impact, and very high-energy consumption. Despite a traditional low innovation pace in PI, in the recent years a strong push at worldwide level towards the dual objective of improving the efficiency of plants and the quality of products, significantly reducing the consumption of electricity and CO2 emissions has taken momentum. Digital Technologies (namely Smart Embedded Systems, IoT, Data, AI and Edge-to-Cloud Technologies) are enabling drivers for a Twin Digital-Green Transition, as well as foundations for human centric, safe, comfortable and inclusive workplaces. Currently, digital sensors in plants produce a large amount of data, which in most cases constitutes just a potential and not a real value for Process Industry, often locked-in in close proprietary systems and seldomly exploited. Digital technologies, with process modelling-simulation via digital twins, can build a bridge between the physical and the virtual worlds, bringing innovation with great efficiency and drastic reduction of waste. In accordance with the guidelines of Industrie 4.0 this work proposes a modular and scalable Reference Architecture, based on open source software, which can be implemented both in brownfield and greenfield scenarios. The ability to distribute processing between the edge, where the data have been created, and the cloud, where the greatest computational resources are available, facilitates the development of integrated digital solutions with cognitive capabilities. The reference architecture is being validated in the three pilot plants, paving the way to the development of integrated planning solutions, with scheduling and control of the plants, optimizing the efficiency and reliability of the supply chain, and balancing energy efficiency.

AB  - The goal in this study is to highlight the value of using emergent technologies to support human effort in identifying creative design problems. First, we explore the relationship between design and creativity - a popular concept and an important requirement in engineering design process. A search is conducted across repositories. This includes search in Google, Google Scholar and Google Books databases in addition to others. Findings show that the extent to which the design process requires creativity is somewhat obscure and not generally perceptible. We observe that creativity consists of two aspects: problem-solving and problem-exploring. We also observe that creativity drives the design process, not by the way of problem-solving but by the way of problem-exploring. However, currently, focus is on problem-solving than the equally important problem-exploring. For every 135 studies on problem-solving, there is only one on problem-exploring. Study on problem-exploring is limited. We research further and identify some determinants of the neglect in problem-exploring in design. These determinants are lack of motivation, significant level of difficulty and the presence of many problems yet unsolved. Using the X-Design Process model and Problem-dependent Solution model we show the importance and benefits of problem-exploring in design and why it deserves attention. Consequently, we illustrate the use of emergent technologies to support problem-exploring in design and give reasons why this is possible in Industry 4.0. These technologies include data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, duplication recognition, and so on. We indicate that these technologies will only play subordinate role to humans towards inspiring problem-exploring in design. Also, we state that a precondition to applying these technologies is a study of the human problem-exploring cognition process for subsequent simulation. Success in computational problem-exploring would lead to breakthroughs in global problem-exploring and trigger more creative solutions in coming years.

AB  - Phenomenology aspires to philosophical analysis of humans' subjective experience while it strives to avoid pitfalls of subjectivity. The first step towards naturalizing phenomenology — making phenomenology scientific — is to reconcile phenomenology with modern physics, on the one hand, and with modern cellular and molecular neuroscience, on the other hand. In this paper, free will is chosen for a case study to demonstrate the feasibility. Special attention is paid to maintain analysis with mathematical precision, if possible, and to evade the inherent deceptive power of natural language. Laplace's determinism is re-evaluated along with the concept of microscopic reversibility. A simple and transparent version of proof demonstrates that microscopic reversibility is irreconcilably incompatible with macroscopic irreversibility, contrary to Boltzmann's claim. But the verdict also exalts Boltzmann's statistical mechanics to the new height of a genuine paradigm shift, thus cutting the umbilical cord linking it to Newtonian mechanics. Laplace's absolute determinism must then be replaced with a weaker form of causality called quasi-determinism. Biological indeterminism is also affirmed with numerous lines of evidence. The strongest evidence is furnished by ion channel fluctuations, which obey an indeterministic stochastic phenomenological law. Furthermore, quantum indeterminacy is shown to be relevant in biology, contrary to the opinion of Erwin Schrödinger. In reconciling phenomenology of free will with modern sciences, three issues — alternativism, intelligibility and origination — of free will must be accounted for. Alternativism and intelligibility can readily be accounted for by quasi-determinism. In order to account for origination of free will, the concept of downward causation must be invoked. However, unlike what is commonly believed, there is no evidence that downward causation can influence, shield off, or overpower low-level physical forces already known to physicists. Quasi-determinism offers an escape route: The possibility that downward causation arising from hierarchical organization of biological structures can modify dispersions of physical laws remains open. Empirical evidence in support of downward causation is scanty but nevertheless exists. Still, origination of free will must be considered an unsolved problem at present. It is demonstrated that objectivity does not guarantee scientific rigor in the study of complex phenomena, such as human creativity. In its replacement, universality and overall consistency between a theory and empirical evidence must be maintained. Visual thinking is proposed as a reasoning tool to ensure universality and overall consistency through inference to the best explanation.

AB  - Electrochemists and ecological engineers find environmental bioelectrochemistry appealing; however, there is a big gap between expectations and actual progress in bioelectrochemical system (BES). Implementing such technology opens new opportunities for novel electrochemical reactions for resource recovery and effective wastewater treatment. Loopholes of BES exist in its scaling-up applications, and numerous attempts toward practical applications (200, 1000, and 1500 L) are key successive indicators toward its commercialization. This review emphasized the critical rethinking of standardization of performance indices i.e. current generation (A/m2), net energy recovery (kWh/kg·COD), product/resource yield (mM), and economic feasibility ($/kWh) to make fair comparison with the existing treatment system. Therefore, directional perspectives, including modularity, energy-cost balance, energy and resource recovery, have been proposed for the sustainable market of BES. The current state of the art and up-gradation in resource recovery and contaminant removal warrants a systematic rethinking of functional worth and niches of BES for practical applications.

The new method is applied in Augsburg, Germany, and consists of two main phases: pre-processing and post-processing. The pre-processing phase involves creating geometry, mesh, and extracting results from simulations of traffic pollutant dispersion. In the post-processing phase, the results are combined with satellite images to produce visually optimized results. The demonstration of road traffic air pollution is based on real data from local air quality measurements and specific scenarios. The results indicate that using these visualization tools produce understandable and impressive images and videos. This enhances the public's comprehension of scientific results and raises awareness of environmental issues. An increased understanding of scientific results can reinforce the implementation of environmental policies by pressuring responsible authorities to take action. This paper provides a valuable tool for visualizing air pollution and facilitating public engagement with environmental issues.

AB  - A trend in the academic field is agglomerations among scholars to generate knowledge with a disruptive influence on science and technology; however, the benefits have not been fully substantiated. This paper analyzes over 660,000 papers on artificial intelligence published from 1961 to 2023. We propose a method to calculate the innovative capacity of disruptive knowledge based on the similarity of historical, current, and future keywords, finding that scholars who commence their scientific endeavors earlier possess a heightened capability for disruptive knowledge innovation as Dkc index. The analysis reveals that multiagglomeration scholars have the highest average number of publications and citations, followed by agglomeration-flow scholars. Moreover, a larger agglomeration results in a lower ability to disrupt and consolidate knowledge innovation. Multiagglomeration and agglomeration-flow scholars harm disruptive/consolidative innovations. However, as the agglomeration effect intensifies, these two types of scholars from the disruptive perspective and multiagglomeration scholars from the consolidation perspective have a diminishing marginal effect on innovation capacity. The agglomeration size acts as a partial intermediary in the Multi→Size→Dkc index from the dual perspective and as a full mediator in the Flow→Size→Dkc index from the disruptive perspective, but only with a direct effect from the consolidative perspective.

AB  - There is an urgent need in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to enhance irrigation access to meet the challenges of growing population and climate risk. To achieve this, big investments are currently planned in large irrigation infrastructure. We believe there is danger in following this conventional approach, which requires big lumpsum investments, locking large capital into projects that do not adapt to deep uncertainties from climatic or socio-political factors. Instead, in this Perspective article, we propose an alternate “adaptive investment pathways” (AdIP) approach for planning step-wise investments towards desired objectives, implemented progressively depending on how the future unfolds, in order to gain flexibility. AdIP extends the adaptation pathways concept, which refers to a sequence of actions to be taken in response to a changing reality, and applies it to the context of development under uncertainty. Monitoring and learning is at the heart of this approach, which ensures that the plan adapts as new knowledge becomes available. Thus, AdIP internalizes risk and reduces chances of failures. For financial institutions backing development projects, following a pathway of smaller de-centralized investments lowers risk and incorporates a learning approach that allows re-thinking and adapting along the path. We illustrate the AdIP approach using the case of ephemeral sand river based small-scale irrigation in the drylands of SSA. We conclude that in face of deep uncertainties, the path to successful irrigation development in SSA requires a shift from making few large upfront investments in large-scale projects to making large numbers of smaller investments that assure flexibility.

AB  - Mentalizing, conventionally defined as the process in which we infer the inner thoughts and intentions of others, is a fundamental component of human social cognition. Yet its role, and the nuanced layers involved, in real world social interaction are rarely discussed. To account for this lack of theory, we propose the interactive mentalizing theory (IMT) -to emphasize the role of metacognition in different mentalizing components. We discuss the connection between mentalizing, metacognition, and social interaction in the context of four elements of mentalizing: (i) Metacognition–inference of our own thought processes and social cognitions and which is central to all other components of mentalizing including: (ii) first-order mentalizing–inferring the thoughts and intentions of an agent's mind; (iii) personal second-order mentalizing–inference of other's mentalizing of one's own mind; (iv) Collective mentalizing: which takes at least two forms (a) vicarious mentalizing: adopting another's mentalizing of an agent (i.e., what we think others think of an agent) and (b) co-mentalizing: mentalizing about an agent in conjunction with others' mentalizing of that agent (i.e., conforming to others beliefs about another agent's internal states). The weights of these four elements is determined by metacognitive insight and confidence in one's own or another's mentalizing ability, yielding a dynamic interaction between these circuits. To advance our knowledge on mentalizing during live social interaction, we identify how these subprocesses can be organized by different target agents and facilitated by combining computational modeling and interactive brain approaches.

AB  - Critical thinking about ethics in neuroscience can be a powerful force in enabling research and translating results meaningfully for society. In this chapter, we strive to give those new to neuroscience investigation, as well as more experienced investigators, an introduction to the field of neuroethics such that they may begin to incorporate it into their future work from its very inception. We begin with an overview of the regulatory and oversight mechanisms currently in place that guide the ethical conduct of neuroscience research, followed by an introduction to four of the most salient neuroethics topics relevant to neuroscience research—research with animals, data sharing, incidental findings, and neuroscience communication. First, we discuss how upfront consideration of the societal implications of advances in neuroscience can shape the use of animal models. We situate ethical thinking in this era of big science and big data, reflecting on strategies for sharing databases while protecting contributors and users. Next, we highlight how collaboration among neuroscientists, ethicists, and others can produce positive measures to resolve the problem of incidental discoveries in brain imaging research, as one example of debates on incidental findings more broadly. Third, we discuss the importance of effective and responsible communication of neuroscience research and information. Finally, the mandate of neuroscience research as public service and ethical imperative is addressed by describing opportunities for neuroscientists to engage with societal issues emerging from their research and how this deepens the discourse and adds value to the research enterprise.

AB  - In this reply, we provide an analysis of Alter et al. (2013) response to our earlier paper (Thompson et al., 2013). In that paper, we reported difficulty in replicating Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley, and Eyre’s (2007) main finding, namely that a sense of disfluency produced by making stimuli difficult to perceive, increased accuracy on a variety of reasoning tasks. Alter, Oppenheimer, and Epley (2013) argue that we misunderstood the meaning of accuracy on these tasks, a claim that we reject. We argue and provide evidence that the tasks were not too difficult for our populations (such that no amount of “metacognitive unease” would promote correct responding) and point out that in many cases performance on our tasks was well above chance or on a par with Alter et al.’s (2007) participants. Finally, we reiterate our claim that the distinction between answer fluency (the ease with which an answer comes to mind) and perceptual fluency (the ease with which a problem can be read) is genuine, and argue that Thompson et al. (2013) provided evidence that these are distinct factors that have different downstream effects on cognitive processes.
