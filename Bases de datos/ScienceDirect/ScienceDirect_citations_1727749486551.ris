AB  - Number sense can be described as good intuition about numbers and their relationships. Individuals with good number sense tend to exhibit the following characteristics when performing mental computations; sense-making approach, planning and control, flexibility and appropriateness sense of reasonableness. This is a very important skill to be mastered by every individual to enable them to handle numerical problems in their daily life. Students rarely face problems with algorithms. Unfortunately, many studies have showed that students have poor understanding in making sense on numbers when tested on their competency in number sense component. This study aims to investigate if there is a relationship between student performance in number sense and mathematics achievement and to explore the components of number sense that students are weak in.

AB  - As online social networks have become dominant platforms for public discourse worldwide, there is growing anecdotal evidence of a concurrent rise in social antagonisms. Yet, while the increase in polarization is evident, the extent to which these digital communication ecosystems are driving this shift remains elusive. A dominant scholarly perspective suggests that digital social media lead to the compartmentalization of information channels, potentially culminating in the emergence of echo chambers. However, a growing body of empirical research suggests that the mechanisms influencing ideological demarcation are more complex than a complete communicative decoupling of user groups. This study introduces two intertwined principles that elucidate the dynamics of digital communication: First, socio-cognitive biases of social group formation enforce internal congruence of ideological communities by demarcation from outsiders. Second, algorithmic personalization of content contributes to ideological network formation by creating social redundancy, wherein the same individuals frequently interact in various roles, such as authors, recipients, or disseminators of messages, leading to a surplus of shared ideological fragments. Leveraging these insights, we pioneer a computational simulation model, integrating machine learning based on behavioral data and established recommendation technologies, to explore the evolution of social network structures in digital exchanges. Utilizing advanced methods in opinion dynamics, our model uniquely captures both the algorithmic delivery and the subsequent dissemination of messages by users. Our findings reveal that in ambiguous debate scenarios, the dual components of our model are essential to accurately capture the emergence of social polarization. Consequently, our model offers a forward-looking perspective on the evolution of network communication, facilitating nuanced comparisons with empirical graph benchmarks.

However, it does not have a best practice for simultaneously deploying IoT and cloud computing with robust security. In this study, we present a novel authentication scheme for IoT-based architectures combined with cloud servers. To pursue the best efficiency, lightweight crypto-modules, such as one-way hash function and exclusive-or operation, are adopted in our authentication scheme. It not only removes the computation burden but also makes our proposed scheme suitable for resource-limited objects, such as sensors or IoT devices. Through the formal verification delivered by Proverif, the security robustness of the proposed authentication scheme is guaranteed. Furthermore, the performance evaluation presents the practicability of our proposed scheme in which a user-acceptable computation cost is achieved.

AB  - Today we can use physics to describe in great detail many of the phenomena intervening in the process of life. But no analogous unified description exists for the phenomenon of life itself. In spite of their complexity, all living creatures are out of equilibrium chemical systems sharing four fundamental properties: they (1) handle information, (2) metabolize, (3) self-reproduce and (4) evolve. This small number of features, which in terran life are implemented with biochemistry, point to an underlying simplicity that can be taken as a guide to motivate and implement a theoretical physics style unified description of life using tools from the non-equilibrium physical-chemistry of extended systems. Representing a system with general rules is a well stablished approach to model building and unification in physics, and we do this here to provide an abstract mathematical description of life. We start by reviewing the work of previous authors showing how the properties in the above list can be individually represented with stochastic reaction-diffusion kinetics using polynomial reaction terms. These include “switches” and computation, the kinetic representation of autocatalysis, Turing instability and adaptation in the presence of both deterministic and stochastic environments. Thinking of these properties as existing on a space-time lattice each of whose nodes are subject to a common mass-action kinetics compatible with the above, leads to a very rich dynamical system which, just as natural life, unifies the above properties and can therefore be interpreted as a high level or “outside-in” theoretical physics representation of life. Taking advantage of currently available advanced computational techniques and hardware, we compute the phase plane for this dynamical system both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. We do simulations and show numerically how the system works. We review how to extract useful information that can be mapped into emergent physical phenomena and attributes of importance in life such as the presence of a “membrane” or the time evolution of an individual system's negentropy or mass. Once these are available, we illustrate how to perform some basic phenomenology based on the model's numerical predictions. Applying the above to the idealization of the general Cell Division Cycle (CDC) given almost 25 years ago by Hunt and Murray, we show from the numerical simulations how this system executes a form of the idealized CDC. We also briefly discuss various simulations that show how other properties of living systems such as migration towards more favorable regions or the emergence of effective Lotka-Volterra populations are accounted for by this general and unified view from the “top” of the physics of life. The paper ends with some discussion, conclusions, and comments on some selected directions for future research. The mathematical techniques and powerful simulation tools we use are all well established and presented in a “didactical” style. We include a very rich but concise SI where the numerical details are thoroughly discussed in a way that anyone interested in studying or extending the results would be able to do so.

AB  - In this paper, we further strengthen our eFeed-Hungers research efforts in fighting the hunger using the advanced computer technologies. According to the United Nations hunger reports, the amount of the globally produced food is adequate enough to serve the whole world of about 7.5 billion people. Despite this, the world is globally experiencing the growing hunger and growing food waste issues and consequently, the food-deprived suffering. The primary cause of this is dubbed as the unavailability of the proper conduits to efficiently and effectively channel the food waste to the food-deprived population. The eFeed-Hungers is one such globally popular computational framework that provenly addresses these concerns and challenges and smoothly connects the edible food waste to needy. In this research, we have extended the strength of eFeed-Hungers platform to smartly address the mass donations at one location. Further, the required technical artifacts are appropriately implemented to expand the horizon of eFeed-Hungers operations to respond to the global communities with disparate time zones. Additionally, the eFeed-Hungers ecosystem is equipped with the verification and validation system for the incoming food donations to further ensure the consumer’s safely and security. The system is also developed to be responsive especially for the basic pervasive computing devices - mobiles or smartphones of any dimensions to equip the donors as well as consumers to respectively donate and search the food pervasively.

The essay sketches the context of polarized emotionality and the crisis of truth characterizing current U.S. politics, centrally engaging Arlie Hochschild's concept of “feeling rules”. We explore the limitations of “affect theory” for researching mediatized politics, contending that the stark differentiation of “affect” from “emotion” reifies the rational, autonomous, liberal conception of the subject, and is of limited value for political communications research. Instead, we emphasize the relational nature of affect and emotion, and the value of feminist politics of emotion research. Our analysis evaluates the limitations of contemporary scholarship on affect, social media, and politics in the context of the grave challenges posed by algorithmic governance and computational propaganda. We conclude by suggesting the concept of “networked subjectivity” for understanding mediatized politics, and the importance of the “affective feedback loop” within the context of the social media “culture of likes.”

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous molecules of non-coding RNA that form a covalently closed loop at the 3′ and 5′ ends. Recently, the role of these molecules in the regulation of gene expression and their involvement in several human pathologies has gained notoriety. The identification of circRNAs is highly dependent on computational methods for analyzing RNA sequencing data. However, bioinformatics software is known to be problematic in terms of usability. Evidence points out that tools for identifying circRNAs can have such problems, negatively impacting researchers in this field. Here we present a heuristic-based framework for evaluating the usability of command-line circRNA identification software.
Methods
We used heuristics evaluation to comprehensively identify the usability issues in a sample of circRNA identification tools.
Results
We identified 46 usability issues presented individually in four tools. Most of the issues had cosmetic or minor severity. These are unlikely to challenge experienced users but may cause inconvenience for novice users. We also identified severe issues with the potential to harm users regardless of their experience. The areas most affected were the documentation and the installability of the tools.
Conclusions
With the proposed framework, we formally describe, for the first time, the usability problems that can affect users in this area of circRNA research. We hope that our framework can help researchers evaluate their software's usability during development.

AB  - Brain tumor segmentation (BTS) has been studied from handcrafted engineered features to conventional machine learning (ML) methods, followed by the cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Each recent approach has attempted to overcome the challenges of previous methods and brought conveniences in efficacy, throughput, computation, explainability, investigation, and interpretability. Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms show excellent performance regarding diverse fields, including image process, computer vision, health analytics, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processes; however, ultimately impediment in making the artificial intelligence explainable and interpretable to clinicians while dealing with critical health informatics and radiomics. Besides the sophisticated deep learning models for brain tumor segmentation, notorious notions like explainability, investigation, trust, and interpretability of DL raised significant concerns for clinicians in their domains. Among many DL methods, the neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) concept has gained more attention as it can contribute to explainable and interpretable AI. In the current study, we survey the prominent approaches, from handcrafted engineering conventional ML to deep learning algorithms, highlight the challenges in DL algorithms, and propose NSL architectures for BTS. Compared to existing surveys, our study not only outlines handcrafted to DL methods for BTS but also proposed explainable and interpretable pipelines appropriate for clinical practices. Our study can better facilitate novice learners in explainable AI and propose efficient, robust, interpretable DL models to facilitate the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of BTS.

AB  - Data-driven models have emerged as popular choices for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in process industries. However, real-time updating of these models due to streaming data requires significant computational resources, is tedious and therefore pauses difficulty in fault detection. To address this problem, in this study, we have developed a novel forward-learning neural network framework that can efficiently update data-driven models in real time for high-frequency data without compromising the accuracy. The neural network parameters are updated using a suitably constructed forward-forward learning algorithm instead of the traditional backpropagation algorithm. Firstly, we develop a variance-capturing forward-forward autoencoder (VFFAE) for FDI. Further, we showcase that the previously trained VFFAE model can be quickly adapted to incoming data which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. We have three process case studies to validate the proposed approach, namely, the Tennesse-Eastman dataset, nuclear power flux dataset, and wastewater plant dataset, to validate the proposed approach. Our findings demonstrate that within the initial 90 s, the model underwent 90 updates using a forward-forward approach and only 10 updates using backpropagation-based methods without compromising accuracy. This highlights the model’s capacity to effectively handle streaming data during the modeling process.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of tooth profile modification on spur planetary gear vibration. An analytical model is proposed to capture the excitation from tooth profile modifications at the sun–planet and ring–planet meshes. The accuracy of the proposed model for dynamic analysis is correlated against a benchmark finite element analysis. Perturbation analysis yields a closed-form approximation of the vibration response with tooth profile modifications. The perturbation solution is used to investigate the effects of tooth profile modification. The tooth profile modification parameters that minimize response are readily obtained. Static transmission error and dynamic response are minimized at different amounts of profile modification, which contradicts common practical thinking regarding the correlation between static transmission error and dynamic response. Contrary to expectations, the optimal sun–planet and ring–planet tooth profile modifications that minimize response when applied individually may increase dynamic response when applied simultaneously. System parameters such as mesh stiffness and mesh phase significantly affect the influence of tooth profile modification.

The presented algorithm originates from computation biology and works on very long chains of symbols, which come from reference patterns of the genome. The software solutions in the field are very limited and need large time and space resources. Main research efforts have been done to investigate the properties of the searching algorithm. Especially the influence of the penalty values assigned for the mismatch, the insertion and the deletion on the algorithm has been analyzed. This allows obtaining completely new algorithm that offers extremely efficient implementation and exhibits outstanding performance. The different FPGA generations have been considered as target families for the searching algorithm based on the dynamic programming idea. The obtained results are very promising and show the dominance of the dedicated platforms over the general purpose PC-based systems.

AB  - The ability to forecast energy prices in the long-term is important for a wide range of reasons, from the formulation of countries' energy and transportation policies to the defensive strategies of nations to investment decisions within the private sector. Despite the importance of these predictions, however, forecasters and market pundits face a difficult challenge when trying to forecast over the long-term. While statistical models can credibly rely on assumptions about the relationship between variables in the short-term, they are frequently less reliable in the long-term as political and technological transformations profoundly change how the economy works over time. Towards improving long-term predictions for energy commodities, this paper uses the elicitation and aggregation of experts' beliefs to put forward forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices by incentivizing experts to tell the truth and minimising their own biases through the application of the Bayesian Truth Serum. With this approach, we generated both short-term and long-term forecasts, and used the short-term forecast to validate the quality of the experts' predictions.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Although target proteins are flexible and can adopt one or more of a manifold of induced conformations, binding sites on proteins have evolved to recognize a limited number of endogenous modulators and substrates and to exclude others. This chapter reviews fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) on the historical and operational level and explains how it can be applied on a case-by-case basis. FBBD determines which molecular substructures or fragments interact with targets of interest and how they bind, and then uses that information to obtain drugs for therapy. It represents a paradigm shift in thinking of how to approach the lead generation process in drug discovery, and is an attempt to get more information rapidly while doing the same amount of work overall. The study draws comparison between the FBDD and HTS/HTL approaches. In the FBDD approach, the medicinal chemist plays the role of a combined synthetic and structural chemist. The emphasis on informatics is greatly reduced because there is less data overall and most of it, such as from NMR or X-ray crystal structures, is visually analyzed, typically being complemented only by functional assay data on just the target itself. Several different computational methods have been developed to prescreen fragment libraries as a way to select members for further study and consideration.

Online diagnostic services relieve computing and storage requirements of wearable devices with the help of the cloud, while facilitating remote collaboration and data sharing, providing instant access to major diagnostics that patients can obtain the diagnosis within seconds, thereby saving a lot of time and economic costs. However, the frequent occurrence of security incidents based on wireless transmission of wearable devices further exacerbates the security risks of patient health data, and therefore the security of online diagnosis based on wearable devices should be taken seriously. This paper proposes privacy-preserving logistic regression based online disease diagnosis (LR-DDH), where the privacy of the medical data can be preserved with the use of homomorphic authenticated encryption. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the scheme LR-DDH proposed in this paper achieves efficient computation and communication under the premise of security.

AB  - Summary
Transition metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for accessing various value-added structural motifs. However, addressing the remote C–H activation including γ-C(sp3)–H and meta-C(sp2)–H versions is far less investigated and more challenging than that of ortho-C(sp2)–H activation. By fine-tuning the characteristics of the C–osmium (Os) σ bond in situ generated by the phenylpyridine scaffold-mediated ortho-C–H activation/C,N-bidentate coordination, either Os(II)-catalyzed intramolecular γ-C(sp3)–H amidation or intermolecular meta-C(sp2)–H alkylation has been realized in a highly efficient and chemo-/site-/region-selective manner. Through integrated experimental and computational mechanistic studies, the principle of the observed selectivity and two distinct reaction pathways, involving the Os(IV)-nitrenoid-mediated Os(II)-Os(IV)-Os(II) catalytic cycle and the Os(III)-radical-enabled Os(II)-Os(III)-Os(II) SET process, respectively, have been also clarified. Taken together, it provides an insightful reference benchmark for the future development of more wonderful C–H functionalizations mediated by transition metals, especially by less-explored Os.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion processes can generate renewable energy in the form of biogas while treating organic wastewater. The generation of biogas within anaerobic digestion systems is directly linked to the mixing conditions inside the reactors. In high-rate reactors such as the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, the expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor and the internal circulation (IC) reactor, the hydrodynamic behaviour will depend on the interactions between the wastewater, the biogas, and the biomass granules. Over the past few years, various researchers have used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the hydrodynamic behaviour in these types of reactors. This review aims to present and critically discuss the state of the art in the use of CFD applied to anaerobic granular sludge reactors (AGSRs). It briefly introduces and discusses the various aspects of modelling. It also reviews the various papers which used CFD to model these reactors and critically analyses the models used for the simulations in terms of general approaches and single-phase vs multiphase studies. The methods used in the validation of the CFD models are also described and discussed. Based on the findings, the challenges and future perspectives for the CFD modelling of AGSRs are discussed and gaps in the knowledge are identified.

AB  - The construction industry faces various challenges, e.g. reducing its carbon footprint and the extensive use of materials. Therefore, Computational Design and Additive Manufacturing gain more importance throughout the industry. In combination, they offer the possibility of manufacturing individually designed building components, which can be less material-consuming and structurally improved. The presented research displays and discusses the effect of force-flow-oriented reinforcement design in concrete beams concerning the flexural strength and the required amount of steel. For this purpose, different reinforcement layouts were designed and integrated into conventionally cast and additively manufactured beam components. For the design of the force-flow-oriented reinforcement layouts, a digital workflow is established, and FEM simulations are utilised. The load-bearing capacity of the beams is compared based on four-point bending tests. Due to the optimised reinforcement layout, an increase of flexural strength of more than 60% was achieved while keeping the reinforcement amount constant. It is also shown that using force-flow-oriented reinforcement layouts can save nearly 60% of the reinforcement needed to achieve the same flexural strength as a beam with a conventional reinforcement cage. Finally, the potential for automated force-flow-oriented reinforcement integration within additively manufactured components is discussed.

AB  - The influence of biological sex differences on human health and disease, while being increasingly recognized, has long been underappreciated and underexplored. While humans of all sexes are more alike than different, there is evidence for sex differences in the most basic aspects of human biology and these differences have consequences for the etiology and pathophysiology of many diseases. In a disease like cancer, these consequences manifest in the sex biases in incidence and outcome of many cancer types. The ability to deliver precise, targeted therapies to complex cancer cases is limited by our current understanding of the underlying sex differences. Gaining a better understanding of the implications and interplay of sex differences in diseases like cancer will thus be informative for clinical practice and biological research. Here we review the evidence for a broad array of biological sex differences in humans and discuss how these differences may relate to observed sex differences in various diseases, including many cancers and specifically glioblastoma. We focus on areas of human biology that play vital roles in healthy and disease states, including metabolism, development, hormones, and the immune system, and emphasize that the intersection of sex differences in these areas should not go overlooked. We further propose that mathematical approaches can be useful for exploring the extent to which sex differences affect disease outcomes and accounting for those in the development of therapeutic strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT

Five years ago, as I was starting my lab, I wrote about two functional genomic screens in fungi that had inspired me (mSphere 4:e00299-19, https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00299-19). Now, I want to discuss some of the principles and questions that I ask myself and my students as we embark on our own screens. A good screen, whether it is a genetic or chemical screen, can be the starting point for new discovery and an excellent basis for the beginning of a scientific research project. However, screens are often criticized for being “fishing expeditions.” To stretch this metaphor to the extreme, this is because people are worried that we do not know how to fish, that we will come home without any fish, bring home the wrong fish, or not know what to do with a fish if we caught it. How you set up the screen and analyze the results determines whether the screen will be useful. In this mini-review, and in the spirit of teaching a scientist to fish, I will discuss recent excellent fungal genetic and chemical screens that illustrate some of the key aspects of a successful screen.

AB  - We consider the noncoherent deep learning problem for coded signal detection under the phase noncoherent channels for remote home healthcare applications with high data rate. In particular, a multiple-symbol noncoherent learning detection (MNLD) scheme based on neural networks is proposed for low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded noncoherent quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals in IEEE 802.15.3 Wireless Multi-media Networks. Our derivation shows that extensive operations for the first kind zero-order modified Bessel function is unavoidable for the implementation of the optimal bit log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for decoding in traditional multiple-symbol detection (MSD) scheme. The perfect estimation of the channel state information (CSI), i.e., a priori information about the variance of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), is also required for the receiver. This is clearly not computationally practical for Wireless Multi-media Networks. Consequently, we developed an improved approach based on feed-forward neural networks to accurately calculate the bit LLR. Furthermore, to decrease the generation size of training set and thus increase the training speed of the proposed neural networks, we uniformly quantize the continuous carrier phase offset (CPO), which is random and unknown, into discrete status. Our simulation results verify the learning efficiency of this simplified training-set generation configuration. The decoding convergence is successfully accelerated and much performance gain is finally achieved when compared with traditional decoding using the perfect bit LLR. This is clearly critical for high reliable transmission of home healthcare information.

AB  - The overarching aim of this study was to explore young children's (N = 25, Mage = 5.16 years) play with two coding games (Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable) in a 1:1 child to tablet setting. We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning. As opportunities for individual device ownership in classrooms increase, future work should continue to explore how game features influence learning.

AB  - Neuropharmacology had several major past successes, but the last few decades did not witness any leap forward in the drug treatment of brain disorders. Moreover, current drugs used in neurology and psychiatry alleviate the symptoms, while hardly curing any cause of disease, basically because the etiology of most neuro-psychic syndromes is but poorly known. This review argues that this largely derives from the unbalanced prevalence in neuroscience of the analytic reductionist approach, focused on the cellular and molecular level, while the understanding of integrated brain activities remains flimsier. The decline of drug discovery output in the last decades, quite obvious in neuropharmacology, coincided with the advent of the single target-focused search of potent ligands selective for a well-defined protein, deemed critical in a given pathology. However, all the widespread neuro-psychic troubles are multi-mechanistic and polygenic, their complex etiology making unsuited the single-target drug discovery. An evolving approach, based on systems biology considers that a disease expresses a disturbance of the network of interactions underlying organismic functions, rather than alteration of single molecular components. Accordingly, systems pharmacology seeks to restore a disturbed network via multi-targeted drugs. This review notices that neuropharmacology in fact relies on drugs which are multi-target, this feature having occurred just because those drugs were selected by phenotypic screening in vivo, or emerged from serendipitous clinical observations. The novel systems pharmacology aims, however, to devise ab initio multi-target drugs that will appropriately act on multiple molecular entities. Though this is a task much more complex than the single-target strategy, major informatics resources and computational tools for the systemic approach of drug discovery are already set forth and their rapid progress forecasts promising outcomes for neuropharmacology.

AB  - Thermal comfort research aims to determine the relationship between the thermal environment and the human sense of warmth. This is usually achieved by measuring the subjective human thermal response to different thermal environments. However, it is common practice to use simple linear regression to analyse data collected using ordinal scales. This practice may lead to severe errors in inference. This study first set the methodological foundations to analyse subjective thermal comfort data from a statistical perspective. Subsequently, we show the practical consequences of fallacious assumptions by utilising a Bayesian approach and show, through an illustrative example, that a linear regression model applied to ordinal data suggests results different from those obtained using ordinal regression. Specifically, linear regression found no difference in means and effect size between genders, while the ordinal regression model led to the opposite conclusion. In addition, the linear regression model distorts the estimated regression coefficient for air temperature compared to the ordinal model. Finally, the ordinal model shows that the distance between adjacent response categories of the ASHRAE 7-point thermal sensation scale is not equidistant. Given the abovementioned issues, we advocate utilising ordinal models instead of metric models to analyse ordinal data.

AB  - Language is the ability to use complex communication systems and a set of signals used to encode and decode information. Mathematics and linguistics deal with the representation of thought through symbolic language under a guiding structure of language functioning. Computer language is formal, symbolic, and depends on linguistic principles of natural language. Computing regulates the behavior of the machine in the execution of specific tasks and, for that, generative models were developed. The underlying structure of the latter would be adequate to incorporate complex and high-dimensional data in a latent space with a supposed ability to replicate the original data. The distribution in probabilistic terms, however, does not reflect reality. We suggest the logical-axiomatic principle of natural language as an algorithmic core of computational methods capable of generalizing the execution of a set of factors.

AB  - Nuclear Material Balance code version 4.0 (NMB4.0) has been developed through collaborative R&D between TokyoTech&JAEA. Conventional nuclear fuel cycle simulation codes mainly analyze actinides and are specialized for front-end mass balance analysis. However, quantitative back-end simulation has recently become necessary for considering R&D strategies and sustainable nuclear energy utilization. Therefore, NMB4.0 was developed to realize the integrated nuclear fuel cycle simulation from front- to back-end. There are three technical features in NMB4.0: 179 nuclides are tracked, more than any other code, throughout the nuclear fuel cycle; the Okamura explicit method is implemented, which contributes to reducing the numerical cost while maintaining the accuracy of depletion calculations on nuclides with a shorter half-life; and flexibility of back-end simulation is achieved. The main objective of this paper is to show the newly developed functions, made for integrated back-end simulation, and verify NMB4.0 through a benchmark study to show the computational performance.

AB  - Edge computing is seen as a set of remotely available computer system resources that drive the computing power at the source of data to improve energy efficiency and security, as well as decrease latency. Although the computation capability of biomedical wearables has increased extremely during the past decade, it is still challenging to perform sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in a resource-constrained environment for energy-efficiency and (near) real-time processing, along the edge-cloud continuum. The aim of this chapter is twofold. The first is to outline the role of edge computing on the Internet of Medical Things, in which wearable technologies are used as the sensory equipment for respiratory analysis, at the transition of patient monitoring from hospital to home. The second is to discuss the potential of explainable AI in the P4 health-care context for respiratory analysis, by highlighting computational intelligence and multisource fusion approaches to achieve continuous monitoring of respiratory analysis.

AB  - The spatial distribution of molecules and cells is fundamental to understanding biological systems. Traditionally, microscopies based on electromagnetic waves such as visible light have been used to localize cellular components by direct visualization. However, these techniques suffer from limitations of transmissibility and throughput. Complementary to optical approaches, biochemical techniques such as crosslinking can colocalize molecules without suffering the same limitations. However, biochemical approaches are often unable to combine individual colocalizations into a map across entire cells or tissues. Microscopy-by-sequencing techniques aim to biochemically colocalize DNA-barcoded molecules and, by tracking their thus unique identities, reconcile all colocalizations into a global spatial map. Here, we review this new field and discuss its enormous potential to answer a broad spectrum of questions.

As the scientific community accumulates diverse data describing how molecular mechanisms occur, creating and sharing visual models that integrate the richness of this information has become increasingly important to help us explore, refine, and communicate our hypotheses. Three-dimensional (3D) animation is a powerful tool to capture dynamic hypotheses that are otherwise difficult or impossible to visualize using traditional 2D illustration techniques. This perspective discusses the current and future roles that 3D animation can play in the research sphere.

AB  - Ideology and political education can be strengthened through legal interventions to enhance the judiciary learner approach and instill values and culture in college students' programs. Traditional methods are employed for rapid learning in ideology teaching and politics and social instruction. A self-assessment learning system allows students to evaluate their progress and the significance of changed learning criteria. Democratizing the teaching system and transforming ideological education present challenges, but Internet Multi-Media (IMM) and Digital Virtual Technology (DVT) provides innovative solutions. IMM-DVT enables comparative explorations and better comprehension of ideological and political education. It facilitates understanding of unequal social interactions and promotes the political, economic, and social sciences as essential components of ideology. Collecting knowledge through media streams and enabling interactions in teaching and learning improves educational effectiveness. Innovative ideological and cultural education strategies help to measure political development and college students' ideas resulting from individual experiences. The college's coordination of social practice projects with the examination has led to improved evaluation results for the ideological and political theory course, along with enhanced social practice competence among the students.

AB  - Brass, which appears golden in color, used to be a valuable alloy in ancient times. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Chinese used special furnaces to smelt zinc for minting and exporting to overseas in large quantities. Archeological findings have revealed the overall structure of the zinc smelting furnaces at the Tongmuling site during the Qing Dynasty. In this study, computational fluid dynamics software was employed to simulate airflow fields within a furnace. Consequently, we observed that airflows were concentrated at the center of the lower chamber, after which they dispersed into the upper chamber through ceramic pads and finally were evenly distributed between the retorts. Increasing furnace height and improving thermal convection in the lower chamber helped increase the furnace temperature. The ceramic pads adjusted the airflow to ensure that temperature distribution in the upper chamber was uniform, and they supported burning in the upper chamber by preventing collapse. Compared with the heap smelting process recorded in Heavenly Creations and the large crucible furnaces used in modern times, zinc smelting furnaces at the Tongmuling site possess a unique structure. They serve as a link between preceding and subsequent technologies, offering important evidence for exploring the development of ancient Chinese zinc smelting technologies.

AB  - Continuous ant colony optimization was a population-based heuristic search algorithm inspired by the pathfinding behavior of ant colonies with a simple structure and few control parameters. However, in the case of multimodal and high-dimensional optimization problems, it was often limited to local regions in the feasible domain space, negatively affecting the computational effort required to find the optimal solution point. To alleviate its limitations in this regard, a random following strategy is proposed to enhance communication among the ant colony search agent and other ant colony members within the search dimension. The proposed algorithm that incorporates this strategy is called Random Following Ant Colony Optimization. Then, to evaluate the global optimization performance of the proposed algorithm, the well-known numerical optimization problem, namely the Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017 test suite, is used. First, the proposed algorithm’s parameters are analyzed for sensitivity, scalability experiments, and balanced diversity. Second, it is compared experimentally with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms in dimensions 10, 30, 50, and 100, respectively, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Friedman test, and Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc statistical test are used to synthesize the experimental comparison results. Finally, to evaluate the ability of the proposed algorithm to handle discrete feature selection problems, comparative experiments are conducted on 24 datasets with eight well-known classification methods and five high-performance classification methods. The benchmark test results show that the global optimization performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the winners of the test suite in 50 and 100 dimensions. The results of the feature selection experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much stronger than the well-known and high-performance classification methods on high-dimensional datasets.

AB  - Thinking, articulating, and promoting research focused on themes and issues inherent to urban spaces has posed challenges to various areas of science, particularly encouraging multidisciplinary research. Among the various studies on urban phenomena, those that reflect structural problems, whether of natural origin or resulting from human actions in space, stand out. Examples include recurrent flooding in various cities. In this regard, with the aim of correlating urban problems with the perspectives inherent to Urban Sustainability, this research aims to propose a flood model as a tool for thinking and planning space utilization. The method used consisted of creating a Flood Model, adopting an applied research approach and employing a multidisciplinary theoretical-methodological framework. This research was conducted using a medium-sized city, Montes Claros, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Geotechnologies and Geographic Information System (GIS) were utilized in constructing the Flood Model. As conclusions, the results point towards new perspectives on the conception of Urban Policies and Planning, seeking to establish guidelines to achieve the sustainability of urban spaces and to prevent flooding disasters and risks based on the structured model in this study. Additionally, it underscored the need for oversight of installation works in subdivisions and public area paving to require the construction of an appropriate drainage system tailored to the local reality, as well as the regulation of subdivisions and occupations in floodplains of watercourses, primarily through technical, management, and policy approaches.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objective: This study looks at mitigating and aggravating factors that are associated with the injury severity of pedestrians when they have crashes with another road user and overcomes existing limitations in the literature by focusing attention on the built environment and considering spatial correlation across crashes. Method: Reports for 6,539 pedestrian crashes occurred in Denmark between 2006 and 2015 were merged with geographic information system resources containing detailed information about the built environment and exposure at the crash locations. A linearized spatial logit model estimated the probability of pedestrians sustaining a severe or fatal injury conditional on the occurrence of a crash with another road user. Results: This study confirms previous findings about older pedestrians and intoxicated pedestrians being the most vulnerable road users and crashes with heavy vehicles and in roads with higher speed limits being related to the most severe outcomes. This study provides novel perspectives by showing positive spatial correlations of crashes with the same severity outcomes and emphasizing the role of the built environment in the proximity of the crash. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the need for thinking about traffic calming measures, illumination solutions, road maintenance programs, and speed limit reductions. Moreover, this study emphasizes the role of the built environment, because shopping areas, residential areas, and walking traffic density are positively related to a reduction in pedestrian injury severity. Often, these areas have in common a larger pedestrian mass that is more likely to make other road users more aware and attentive, whereas the same does not seem to apply to areas with lower pedestrian density.

AB  - A network of brain structures including hippocampus (HC), prefrontal cortex, and striatum controls goal-directed behavior and decision making. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these functions are unknown. Here, we review the role of ‘internally generated sequences’: structured, multi-neuron firing patterns in the network that are not confined to signaling the current state or location of an agent, but are generated on the basis of internal brain dynamics. Neurophysiological studies suggest that such sequences fulfill functions in memory consolidation, augmentation of representations, internal simulation, and recombination of acquired information. Using computational modeling, we propose that internally generated sequences may be productively considered a component of goal-directed decision systems, implementing a sampling-based inference engine that optimizes goal acquisition at multiple timescales of on-line choice, action control, and learning.

AB  - Human specie has always engineered the environment to set the conditions for its own settlement, producing in its evolutionary development superorganisms (cities) and the necessary networks of connections among them. Instead of rejecting cars as an extraneous object to a picturesque nature, this project starts from a perspective in which cities and technology are the metabolic extension of human specie and therefore a necessary part of its own nature; the vessels (vehicles) for human transportation, or better, the vehicle-host symbiotic system thus becomes a necessary part of human ecology, and so the network of connections upon which they live, operate and interact with: infrastructures. The project of an environmental enhancer for the Nogara mare highway in Veneto (Italy) provides the unique chance to bring together ecological thinking, host interaction and active materials. Its location (an open country planar area among cultivated fields) enucleates as critical variables the impact of pollutants and the phenomenon of dazzling. With respect to such criticalities, the project uses digital generative and parametric strategies to generate a performative structure in which densification and rarefaction of elements is a local morphological response to dazzle. The structure itself acts as a scaffold for a photo catalytic PET based material that, mimicking the behavior of coccoluti (marine microorganisms) is able to reduce CO2 (and potentially other pollutants) to salts and nitrates that are then naturally deployed to the neighboring cultivated fields as fertilizers. The material has been tested for photo catalytic integration and is currently under development. Present building and production techniques privilege the industrial assembly of inert materials, with a one-way flow of energy and process from raw material to finished product. Instead of this mono-directional energy consumption the project promotes the continuous exchange of information (as code and matter-energy) at all levels and from the digital to the material domains: use of dazzle information, morphogenetic rules and structural behavior to generate the scaffold, a photo catalytic material that responds to pollutants and produces fertilizers, making the structure symbiotic with their hosts and the environment.

AB  - This chapter outlines the contribution of analogical thinking in numerical cognition and specifically to number-word learning and numerical estimation. We begin with an overview of number-word learning, followed by a description of analogical mapping as defined by Gentner, 1983, Gentner, 2010, and discuss how children might acquire the meaning of counting based on analogical mapping. Next, we review the claim that very similar processes of analogical mapping may support numerical estimation, based on findings from studies of dot-array and number-line estimation. These studies suggest that children's knowledge of how the count list is structured and in particular the ordering and distance between numbers affects their ability to make accurate estimates. Finally, we discuss extensions of this idea to other cases where analogy has been proposed as a source of representational change. We conclude that analogical mappings enrich how humans transcend core numerical abilities to represent abstract content.

AB  - Data-driven conceptual design methods and tools aim to inspire human ideation for new design concepts by providing external inspirational stimuli. In prior studies, the stimuli have been limited in terms of coverage, granularity, and retrieval guidance. Here, we present a knowledge-based expert system that provides design stimuli across the semantic, document and field levels simultaneously from all fields of engineering and technology and that follows creativity theories to guide the retrieval and use of stimuli according to the knowledge distance. The system is centered on the use of a network of all technology fields in the patent classification system, to store and organize the world’s cumulative data on the technological knowledge, concepts and solutions in the total patent database according to statistically-estimated knowledge distance between technology fields. In turn, knowledge distance guides the network-based exploration and retrieval of inspirational stimuli for inferences across near and far fields to generate new design ideas by analogy and combination. With two case studies, we showcase the effectiveness of using the system to explore and retrieve multilevel inspirational stimuli and generate new design ideas for both problem solving and open-ended innovation. These case studies also demonstrate the computer-aided ideation process, which is data-driven, computationally augmented, theoretically grounded, visually inspiring, and rapid.

AB  - Structurally diverse decision trees are important for knowledge discovery and classification/prediction accuracy. Over the years, researchers have devoted much effort to the development of algorithms to increase diversity among the trees within an ensemble. While Kappa is commonly used to measure diversity among the decision trees, it does not measure the ability of the tree building algorithms to introduce diversity. Further, Kappa does not consider the structural diversity amongst the trees. Instead, Kappa measures the diversity of the predictions made from the trees produced, and are dependent on the datasets used. This paper presents a novel data-independent metric, called R index, for measuring the diversity that can be introduced by a decision forest algorithm without building the entire decision forest. The proposed measure is applied to five well-known algorithms that involve bagging and random subspacing. An efficient practical approach for calculating the R index empirically – R finder – is also proposed, and is implemented. Both R finder and Kappa were applied to thirty-two publicly available benchmark datasets under various algorithms to estimate the resulting diversity. The results indicate a generally strong negative correlation between R finder and Kappa, implying that R finder is effective at estimating the diversity of trees without the added computational costs associated with calculating Kappa.

AB  - Promoter is a key DNA element located near the transcription start site, which regulates gene transcription by binding RNA polymerase. Thus, the identification of promoters is an important research field in synthetic biology. Nannochloropsis is an important unicellular industrial oleaginous microalgae, and at present, some studies have identified some promoters with specific functions by biological methods in Nannochloropsis, whereas few studies used computational methods. Here, we propose a method called DNPPro (DenseNet-Predict-Promoter) based on densely connected convolutional neural networks to predict the promoter of Nannochloropsis. First, we collected promoter sequences from six Nannochloropsis strains and removed 80% similarity using CD-HIT for each strain to yield a reliable set of positive datasets. Then, in order to construct a robust classifier, within-group scrambling method was used to generate negative dataset which overcomes the limitation of randomly selecting a non-promoter region from the same genome as a negative sample. Finally, we constructed a densely connected convolutional neural network, with the sequence one-hot encoding as the input. Compared with commonly used sequence processing methods, DNPPro can extract long sequence features to a greater extent. The cross-strain experiment on independent dataset verifies the generalization of our method. At the same time, T-SNE visualization analysis shows that our method can effectively distinguish promoters from non-promoters.

AB  - Although detectors currently perform well in well-light conditions, their accuracy decreases due to insufficient object information. In addressing this issue, we propose the Re-parameterization Forward Semantic Compensation Network (RFSC-Net). We propose the Reparameterization Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (RSELAN) for feature extraction, which integrates the concepts of re-parameterization and the Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN). While focusing on the fusion of feature maps of the same dimension, it also incorporates upward fusion of lower-level feature maps, enhancing the detailed texture information in higher-level features. Our proposed Forward Semantic Compensation Feature Fusion (FSCFF) network reduces interference from high-level to low-level semantic information, retaining finer details to improve detection accuracy in low-light conditions. Experiments on the low-light ExDark and DarkFace datasets show that RFSC-Net improves mAP by 2% on ExDark and 0.5% on DarkFace over the YOLOv8n baseline, without an increase in parameter counts. Additionally, AP50 is enhanced by 2.1% on ExDark and 1.1% on DarkFace, with a mere 3.7 ms detection latency on ExDark.

AB  - Permutations are fundamental to combinatorics and other areas of mathematics, and it is important that students develop efficient and conceptually supported ways of mentally constructing, listing, and enumerating them. To date, there is still much to learn about how students reason about enumerating permutations, and how instruction can support students’ conceptual development. We address this gap in the research literature by carefully tracing the evolution of two preservice middle school teachers’ permutation enumeration strategies and conceptualizations, which led to the formulation of levels of sophistication for combinatorial reasoning. These levels are explained by applying and extending a constructivist theory of levels of abstraction. Additionally, we outline an instructional approach that was instrumental in facilitating student learning. Together, the proposed levels and linked instructional approach constitute an initial learning trajectory for permutations that we believe could be useful for understanding and supporting post-secondary non-STEM students’ meaningful conceptualizations and enumerations of permutations.

AB  - The research team of The Linear Algebra Project developed and implemented a curriculum and a pedagogy for parallel courses in (a) linear algebra and (b) learning theory as applied to the study of mathematics with an emphasis on linear algebra. The purpose of the ongoing research, partially funded by the National Science Foundation, is to investigate how the parallel study of learning theories and advanced mathematics influences the development of thinking of individuals in both domains. The researchers found that the particular synergy afforded by the parallel study of math and learning theory promoted, in some students, a rich understanding of both domains and that had a mutually reinforcing effect. Furthermore, there is evidence that the deeper insights will contribute to more effective instruction by those who become high school math teachers and, consequently, better learning by their students. The courses developed were appropriate for mathematics majors, pre-service secondary mathematics teachers, and practicing mathematics teachers. The learning seminar focused most heavily on constructivist theories, although it also examined socio-cultural and historical perspectives. A particular theory, Action–Process–Object–Schema (APOS) [10], was emphasized and examined through the lens of studying linear algebra. APOS has been used in a variety of studies focusing on student understanding of undergraduate mathematics. The linear algebra courses include the standard set of undergraduate topics. This paper reports the results of the learning theory seminar and its effects on students who were simultaneously enrolled in linear algebra and students who had previously completed linear algebra and outlines how prior research has influenced the future direction of the project.

AB  - Data driven-based methods have aroused wide attention in the domain of fault detection and diagnosis of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. However, they are good at learning statistical relationships between faults and symptoms rather than their causal relationships, resulting in poor interpretability. This paper proposes a causal discovery and inference-based fault detection and diagnosis method to address this challenge. It applies a do-calculus-based individual average causal effect estimation approach to reveal causal relationships between faults and symptoms. Based on the causal relationships discovered, a backward structural causal model is developed for fault detection and diagnosis. Regression coefficients in the model are visualized using heatmaps to explain the model reasoning processes. The method is validated using the experimental data collected by the ASHARE project RP-1312. The individual average causal effect estimation approach reveals the causal relationships between eleven air handing unit faults and twenty-eight symptoms successfully. The diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model (99.58%) is almost as high as that of k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Its hyper-parameter optimization time is reduced by 81.64% and 99.91%, respectively, compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. And its model training time is reduced by 38.61% and 92.01%, respectively. Based on the heatmap of regression coefficients of the model, it is demonstrated that the decision-making processes of the model are understandable and consistent with the domain knowledge in most cases.

However, it is not limited to these; it also explores other algorithms to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field. The review identifies and analyzes key trends, challenges, and advancements in drone control and path planning. It investigates the evolution of control strategies, ranging from classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to modern swarm algorithms and reinforcement learning-based techniques. Additionally, it explores path planning methodologies, including traditional optimization algorithms and heuristic-based approaches, and specifically, swarm algorithms within the context of drone swarms. The emphasis on nature-inspired intelligent computation extends to the exploration of swarm intelligence and cooperative planning as integral components of drone path planning. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the literature, this systematic review not only presents a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of drone control and path planning, but it also acknowledges the role of various nature-inspired algorithms, including but not limited to swarm intelligence, and identifies avenues for future research in this evolving field.

AB  - We examine the effects of supplying increasing amounts of trusted advice to a finite automaton. Previous work has shown that allowing such automata with a single advice tape to make a single pass over their input renders them unable to recognize the palindromes language, whereas both two-way machines reading advice from a single tape and one-way machines with multiple advice tapes can recognize all languages with exponentially bounded amounts of advice. We study several architectural variants and demonstrate the existence of language hierarchies based on increased advice length, runtime (measured in terms of the number of allowed left-to-right passes on the input), and number of advice tapes. We also prove some lower bounds for recognizing certain concrete languages.

AB  - The popularity of web-based analytical tools with an emphasis on improved statistical analyses within the landscape of forensic anthropology is increasing. Osteomics is a web-based platform composed of a suite of forensic decision support systems designed to contend with the challenges posed by the estimation of the biological profile of human skeletal remains and particularly the estimation of age at death, the diagnosis of sex, the calculation of body parameters, and the prediction of biogeographic origin. The web applications designed at Osteomics intend to make innovative and reliable statistical models freely available. The suggested models are grounded around traditional and advanced statistical thinking, data visualization and processing, and predictive modeling under the machine learning paradigm. This paper aims to introduce the potential of the web platforms as forensic decision support systems and to give a detailed description of the statistical techniques used in the web-based applications available at Osteomics.

For example, they compute the animal's position in the world by integrating its velocity with respect to time. Other examples are the learning of the solar ephemeris, the construction of a cognitive map, and episodic memory in food caching. Representations require a symbolic read–write memory that carries information extracted from experience forward in time in a computationally accessible form. The analogy between the architecture of computer memory and the genetic architecture suggests the sort of memory structure to be looked for in the nervous system.

AB  - Urban agriculture has become an important research theme in recent years. Over the past decade, a number of different, diverse value chains have been established in the urban areas of developed and developing countries alike, with increasing convergence in their motivations related to food security and livelihoods development, particularly for poor and disadvantaged segments of society. However, for urban agriculture to be sustainable as a livelihoods and resilience strategy will require decision-support tools that allow planners and participants alike to jointly develop strategies and assess potential leverage points within urban food value chains. In this paper, we argue that system dynamics (SD) models combined with participatory approaches have important roles in bridging this gap, though these will need to be adapted to the spatial influences that exist in urban settings. We first review elements of urban agriculture and some of the policy challenges faced in this growing phenomenon. We follow this by motivating the role of SD models in the context of urban agriculture and note their potential utility in overlaying quantitative models of urban food value chains alongside their land-use characteristics, highlighting the dynamic feedbacks between intensive processes within changing urban food systems and extensive processes associated with land-use and planning. From this background, we introduce the concept of spatial group model building (SGMB), which adapts standard group model building concepts to account for both the spatial context of urban agriculture and enables a spatially sensitive, participatory approach to qualitative and quantitative model building. We provide a qualitative proof-of-concept of SGMB principles and techniques in the context of describing the setting and dynamic issues facing organic urban agriculture value chains in Christchurch, New Zealand. Our approach fills an important space between participatory GIS practices and the development of complex spatial system dynamics models, infusing systems thinking principles to participatory processes, while showing a way to enhance the future development of quantitative spatial system dynamics models more generally.

AB  - Recent studies have documented an evolutionarily primitive, early emerging cognitive system for the mental representation of numerical quantity (the analog magnitude system). Studies with nonhuman primates, human infants, and preschoolers have shown this system to support computations of numerical ordering, addition, and subtraction involving whole number concepts prior to arithmetic training. Here we report evidence that this system supports children’s predictions about the outcomes of halving and perhaps also doubling transformations. A total of 138 kindergartners and first graders were asked to reason about the quantity resulting from the doubling or halving of an initial numerosity (of a set of dots) or an initial length (of a bar). Controls for dot size, total dot area, and dot density ensured that children were responding to the number of dots in the arrays. Prior to formal instruction in symbolic multiplication, division, or rational number, halving (and perhaps doubling) computations appear to be deployed over discrete and possibly continuous quantities. The ability to apply simple multiplicative transformations to analog magnitude representations of quantity may form a part of the toolkit that children use to construct later concepts of rational number.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have demonstrated abnormal anisotropic diffusion in schizophrenia. However, examining data with low spatial resolution and/or a low number of gradient directions and limitations associated with analysis approaches sensitive to registration confounds may have contributed to mixed findings concerning the regional specificity and direction of results. This study examined three major white matter tracts connecting lateral and medial temporal lobe regions with neocortical association regions widely implicated in systems-level functional and structural disturbances in schizophrenia. Using DTIstudio, a previously validated regions of interest tractography method was applied to 30 direction diffusion weighted imaging data collected from demographically similar schizophrenia (n=23) and healthy control subjects (n=22). The diffusion tensor was computed at each voxel after intra-subject registration of diffusion-weighted images. Three-dimensional tract reconstruction was performed using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm. Tractography results showed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the arcuate fasciculi (AF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) in patients compared to controls. FA changes within the right ILF were negatively correlated with measures of thinking disorder. Reduced volume of the left AF was also observed in patients. These results, which avoid registration issues associated with voxel-based analyses of DTI data, support that fiber pathways connecting lateral and medial temporal lobe regions with neocortical regions are compromised in schizophrenia. Disruptions of connectivity within these pathways may potentially contribute to the disturbances of memory, language, and social cognitive processing that characterize the disorder.

AB  - We compare various flexible tariffs that have been proposed to cost-effectively govern a prosumer’s electricity management—in particular time-of-use (TOU), critical-peak-pricing (CPP), and a real-time-pricing tariff (RTP). As the outside option, we consider a fixed-price tariff (FP) that restricts the specific characteristics of TOU, CPP, and RTP, so that the flexible tariffs are at least as profitable for the prosumer as the FP tariff. We propose bilevel models to determine the optimal interplay between the retailer’s tariff design and the prosumer’s decisions on using the storage, on consumption, and on electricity purchases from as well as electricity sales to the grid. The single-level reformulations of the considered bilevel models are computationally highly challenging optimization problems since they combine bilinearities and mixed-integer aspects for modeling certain tariff structures. Based on a computational study using real-world data, we find that RTP increases retailer profits, however, leads to the largest price volatility for the prosumer. TOU and CPP only yield mild additional retailer profits and, due to the multiplicity of optimal plans on the part of the prosumer, imply uncertain revenues for the retailer.

AB  - Lawvere theories and monads have been the two main category theoretic formulations of universal algebra, Lawvere theories arising in 1963 and the connection with monads being established a few years later. Monads, although mathematically the less direct and less malleable formulation, rapidly gained precedence. A generation later, the definition of monad began to appear extensively in theoretical computer science in order to model computational effects, without reference to universal algebra. But since then, the relevance of universal algebra to computational effects has been recognised, leading to renewed prominence of the notion of Lawvere theory, now in a computational setting. This development has formed a major part of Gordon Plotkin's mature work, and we study its history here, in particular asking why Lawvere theories were eclipsed by monads in the 1960's, and how the renewed interest in them in a computer science setting might develop in future.

AB  - The need for physically motivated discreteness and finiteness conditions emerges in models of both analog and digital computing that are genuinely concerned with physically realizable computational processes. This is brought out by a critical examination of notional analog superTuring devices which involve physically untenable idealizations about the perfect functioning of analog apparatuses and infinite precision of physical measurements. The capability for virtual behaviour, that is, the capability of interpreting, storing, transforming, creating the code, and thereby mimicking the behaviour of (Turing) machines, is used here to introduce a new dimension in the discussion of the analog–digital watershed. In the light of recent results on the analog simulation of digital computing, we examine the role of virtuality as a discriminating factor between these two species of computing, and immerse this problem in the context of natural computing. Is virtuality instantiated in parts of the natural world other than computer technology? This broad issue is examined in connection with the computational modelling of brain and mental information processing.

AB  - Previous research has shown that upper primary school children frequently erroneously solve additive word problems multiplicatively, while younger children frequently erroneously solve multiplicative word problems additively. It has been suggested that children's preference for additive or multiplicative relations explains these errors, besides their lacking skills, but this claim has not been tested empirically yet. Therefore, we administered four test instruments (a word problem test, a preference test, and two tests measuring additive and multiplicative computation and discrimination skill) to 246 third to sixth graders. Previous research results on errors in word problems, as well as on preference were replicated and systematized. Further, they were extended by explaining this erroneous word problem solving behavior by preference, for those children who unmistakably had acquired the necessary computation and discrimination skills. This finding provides strong evidence for the unique additional role of children's preference in erroneous additive or multiplicative word problem solving behavior.

AB  - While sustainable construction practices effectively reduce environmental impact, their exclusive focus on environmental, economic, and social goals limits their ability to actively foster positive transformation and ecosystem restoration. Addressing the growing challenges in the built environment necessitates a shift to regenerative practices within the construction industry. Unlike sustainability, regenerative practices go beyond the concept of merely sustaining the status quo; they are geared towards actively enhancing and restoring the built environment over time. However, implementing these practices is less prominent in the construction industry due to the absence of a suitable tool for evaluating their expected performance outcomes. This study bridges this gap by introducing a novel performance evaluation framework for implementing regenerative construction practices, establishing a benchmark for implementation. Through an extensive literature review and data collection from a committee of regenerative outcome leads, we employ the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to establish interconnections among key regenerative performance criteria. Results highlight the dominant significance of “Healthy, more resilient, and connected communities,” surpassing other criteria like “Thriving and prosperous natural systems,” “Prosperous and resilient local economies,” and “Net-positive environmental development.” The proposed evaluation framework offers theoretical and practical implications, fostering a new theoretical approach that exceeds sustainability standards and provides tangible guidance for construction decision-makers.

AB  - Bacteria can organise themselves into communities in the forms of biofilms and swarms. Through chemical and physical interactions between cells, these communities exhibit emergent properties that individual cells alone do not have. While bacterial communities have been mainly studied in the context of biochemistry and molecular biology, recent years have seen rapid advancements in the biophysical understanding of emergent phenomena through physical interactions in biofilms and swarms. Moreover, new technologies to control bacterial emergent behaviours by physical means are emerging in synthetic biology. Such technologies are particularly promising for developing engineered living materials (ELM) and devices and controlling contamination and biofouling. In this minireview, we overview recent studies unveiling physical and mechanical cues that trigger and affect swarming and biofilm development. In particular, we focus on cell shape, motion and density as the key parameters for mechanical cell–cell interactions within a community. We then showcase recent studies that use physical stimuli for patterning bacterial communities, altering collective behaviours and preventing biofilm formation. Finally, we discuss the future potential extension of biophysical and bioengineering research on microbial communities through computational modelling and deeper investigation of mechano-electrophysiological coupling.

A ‘semi-transient’ optimisation process is proposed, using Adjoint optimisation data from single instances in time to improve VAWT performance. This is challenging due to the unsteady nature of VAWT aerodynamics. A pitching aerofoil model approximates the VAWT flow field, drastically reducing computational cost. Details are given on the necessary CFD model(s), Adjoint solver settings, and optimisation philosophy. The optimisation process was applied to a typical VAWT in the commercial CFD software ANSYS Fluent. A high tip-speed-ratio case is chosen to minimise unsteady flow affects. The results show novel blade geometries which improve the VAWT average power coefficient when compared to the original NACA0018 blade. Such a method is novel in the field of VAWTs, and the use of Adjoint methods with low cost CFD models provides an efficient optimisation methodology that can be readily adopted by the VAWT design community. This work sets the foundation for a new and very promising avenue for VAWT research.

AB  - Neuropronostication for consciousness disorders can be very complex and prone to high uncertainty. Despite notable advancements in the development of dedicated scales and physiological markers using innovative paradigms, these technical progressions are often overshadowed by factors intrinsic to the medical environment. Beyond the scarcity of objective data guiding medical decisions, factors like time pressure, fatigue, multitasking, and emotional load can drive clinicians to rely more on heuristic-based clinical reasoning. Such an approach, albeit beneficial under certain circumstances, may lead to systematic error judgments and impair medical decisions, especially in complex and uncertain environments. After a brief review of the main theoretical frameworks, this paper explores the influence of clinicians' cognitive biases on clinical reasoning and decision-making in the challenging context of neuroprognostication for consciousness disorders. The discussion further revolves around developing and implementing various strategies designed to mitigate these biases and their impact, aiming to enhance the quality of care and the patient safety.

AB  - Causal graphical models (CGMs) are a popular formalism used to model human causal reasoning and learning. The key property of CGMs is the causal Markov condition, which stipulates patterns of independence and dependence among causally related variables. Five experiments found that while adult’s causal inferences exhibited aspects of veridical causal reasoning, they also exhibited a small but tenacious tendency to violate the Markov condition. They also failed to exhibit robust discounting in which the presence of one cause as an explanation of an effect makes the presence of another less likely. Instead, subjects often reasoned “associatively,” that is, assumed that the presence of one variable implied the presence of other, causally related variables, even those that were (according to the Markov condition) conditionally independent. This tendency was unaffected by manipulations (e.g., response deadlines) known to influence fast and intuitive reasoning processes, suggesting that an associative response to a causal reasoning question is sometimes the product of careful and deliberate thinking. That about 60% of the erroneous associative inferences were made by about a quarter of the subjects suggests the presence of substantial individual differences in this tendency. There was also evidence that inferences were influenced by subjects’ assumptions about factors that disable causal relations and their use of a conjunctive reasoning strategy. Theories that strive to provide high fidelity accounts of human causal reasoning will need to relax the independence constraints imposed by CGMs.

AB  - Modern computing resources provide scientists, engineers, and system design teams the ability to study phenomena, such as system behavior, in a virtual setting. Computational modeling and simulation (M&S) enables engineers to avoid many of the challenges encountered in traditional design engineering, including the design, manufacture, and testing of expensive prototypes prior to having an optimized design. However, the use of M&S carries its own challenges, such as the computational time and resources required to execute effective studies, and uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions inherent to computer models, which are intended to be an approximate representation of reality. In recent year advances have been made in a number of areas related to the efficient and reliable use of M&S for system evaluations, including design & analysis of computer experiments, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic analysis, response optimization, and data synthesis techniques. In this review paper, a general framework for systematically executing efficient M&S studies at the component-level, product-level, system-level, and system-of-systems-level is described. A case study is used to demonstrate how statistical and probabilistic techniques can be integrated with M&S to address those challenges inherent to model-based engineering, and how this aligns with the proposed workflow. The example is a gun-launch dynamics model of an artillery projectile developed by US Army engineers, and illustrates the application of this workflow in the study of subsystem system reliability, performance, and end-to-end system-level characterization.

AB  - Summary
Traditional neurological models of language were based on a single neural pathway (the dorsal pathway underpinned by the arcuate fasciculus). Contemporary neuroscience indicates that anterior temporal regions and the “ventral” language pathway also make a significant contribution, yet there is no computationally-implemented model of the dual pathway, nor any synthesis of normal and aphasic behavior. The “Lichtheim 2” model was implemented by developing a new variety of computational model which reproduces and explains normal and patient data but also incorporates neuroanatomical information into its architecture. By bridging the “mind-brain” gap in this way, the resultant “neurocomputational” model provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between lesion location and behavioral deficits, and to provide a platform for simulating functional neuroimaging data.

AB  - Aberrant decision-making plays an important role in both the onset and maintenance of substance use disorders (SUDs). The current state of research within the field of SUDs can be usefully summarized within three broad dimensions: (1) the goal of characterizing the affected cognitive components that contribute to aberrant decision-making (i.e., value, probability, time, and learning functions), (2) the instruments/methods used to accomplish that goal (i.e., self-reports, behavioral tasks, computational modeling, and brain mapping), and (3) the levels of evidence afforded by those instruments/methods. In this chapter, we review and organize the most recent findings based on this three-dimensional framework. Our aim is to (1) provide a comprehensive synthesis of current research on decision-making in SUDs that can serve as a useful resource to guide future research, (2) highlight current limitations in the field and promising future research directions, and (3) illustrate ways in which the framework that we provide may inform the design and implementation of interventional strategies that can advance the field of addiction medicine.

AB  - CPS (Cyber Physical System) is a large and complex real-time feedback system that integrates computing processes, physical processes, communication networks, sensor networks, and control systems. It has the powerful function of sensing and controlling the physical environment, which is a big wave following the Internet technology. Because the forms of communication, interaction, and collaboration between heterogeneous units within the CPS are intricate and complex, a comprehensive model needs to be established to describe and analyze the CPS. This paper analyzes the CPS architecture and proposes a new and more complete CPS architecture, decomposes according to this architecture, and classifies the physical entities in the CPS. At the same time, event-based modeling thinking is used to define, classify and formalize event messages. Considering the higher real-time requirements of CPS, an event weighting algorithm was designed according to the different priorities of real-time events. In order to reduce the congestion caused by the limited network bandwidth in the CPS system, improve the ability to identify abnormal data with great uncertainty, and fully guarantee the response rate of the CPS system to emergencies, this paper analyzes the complexity of the CPS system from the perspective of information theory. The average dynamic complexity of the CPS system is set as a threshold to determine the level of information entropy of the sensor data in a certain period of time. The CPS system selects high information entropy data to send first. The effectiveness is analyzed through experiments.

AB  - Previous behavioral studies have identified the significant role of subliminal cues in creative problem solving. However, neural mechanisms of such unconscious processing remain poorly understood. Here we utilized an event-related potential (ERP) approach and sandwich mask technique to investigate cerebral activities underlying the unconscious processing of cues in creative problem solving. College students were instructed to solve divergent problems under three different conditions (conscious cue, unconscious cue and no-cue conditions). Our data showed that creative problem solving can benefit from unconscious cues, although not as much as from conscious cues. More importantly, we found that there are crucial ERP components associated with unconscious processing of cues in solving divergent problems. Similar to the processing of conscious cues, processing unconscious cues in problem solving involves the semantic activation of unconscious cues (N280–340) in the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), new association formation (P350–450) in the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36), and mental representation transformation (P500–760) in the right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22). The present results suggest that creative problem solving can be modulated by unconscious processing of enlightening information that is weakly diffused in the semantic network beyond our conscious awareness.

AB  - Objective
Suicide risk prediction algorithms at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) do not include predictors based on the 3-Step Theory of suicide (3ST), which builds on hopelessness, psychological pain, connectedness, and capacity for suicide. These four factors are not available from structured fields in VHA electronic health records, but they are found in unstructured clinical text. An ontology and controlled vocabulary that maps psychosocial and behavioral terms to these factors does not exist. The objectives of this study were 1) to develop an ontology with a controlled vocabulary of terms that map onto classes that represent the 3ST factors as identified within electronic clinical progress notes, and 2) to determine the accuracy of automated extractions based on terms in the controlled vocabulary.
Methods
A team of four annotators did linguistic annotation of 30,000 clinical progress notes from 231 Veterans in VHA electronic health records who attempted suicide or who died by suicide for terms relating to the 3ST factors. Annotation involved manually assigning a label to words or phrases that indicated presence or absence of the factor (polarity). These words and phrases were entered into a controlled vocabulary that was then used by our computational system to tag 14 million clinical progress notes from Veterans who attempted or died by suicide after 2013. Tagged text was extracted and machine-labelled for presence or absence of the 3ST factors. Accuracy of these machine-labels was determined for 1000 randomly selected extractions for each factor against a ground truth created by our annotators.
Results
Linguistic annotation identified 8486 terms that related to 33 subclasses across the four factors and polarities. Precision of machine-labeled extractions ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 for most factor-polarity combinations, whereas recall was somewhat lower 0.65–0.91.
Conclusion
The ontology that was developed consists of classes that represent each of the four 3ST factors, subclasses, relationships, and terms that map onto those classes which are stored in a controlled vocabulary (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/THREE-ST). The use case that we present shows how scores based on clinical notes tagged for terms in the controlled vocabulary capture meaningful change in the 3ST factors during weeks preceding a suicidal event.

AB  - The Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer (MRVAA) is the main irrigation source for the Lower Mississippi River Basin. Irrigation water abstraction to meet the demands for extensive agricultural practices has contributed to groundwater depletion in this area. A managed aquifer recharge (MAR) approach has been proposed in this geographic location to minimize the impact of pumping on groundwater depletion. However, it is essential to determine the optimal amount of water to be injected through a MAR technique to reduce the decline in groundwater heads. This paper utilizes a coupled simulation–optimization (S-O) approach to estimate the optimal recharge volume into the alluvial aquifer through infiltration galleries. The aquifer processes were simulated using a physically based, three-dimensional finite-difference numerical code, MODFLOW. The MODFLOW model was calibrated and validated using the recharge rates and available groundwater head data for 26 months (27 February 2020 to 27 May 2022). The calibrated and validated models were then deployed within the coupled S-O approach to develop an aquifer recharge management model to estimate optimal groundwater recharge rates to minimize groundwater decline. Computational efficiency of the aquifer recharge management model was achieved using surrogate models that accurately reproduced the groundwater heads calculated by MODFLOW. Our evaluation demonstrates that a planned transient groundwater recharge strategy, obtained as a solution of the surrogate model based coupled S-O approach, is a useful management strategy for optimized water recharge and groundwater depletion control. This study shows the promise of the surrogate model based coupled S-O approach to potentially reduce groundwater depletion in the MRVAA by utilizing optimized recharge rates at the infiltration galleries. This work has potential applications to other aquifers and geographic locations to mitigate groundwater depletion issues due to extensive agricultural practices.

AB  - Questions of social behavior are simultaneously among the most fundamental in neuroscience and the most challenging in artificial intelligence. Yet despite decades of work, a unified perspective from the cognitive and computational approaches to the problem has yet to emerge. Recently, however, excitement around the challenges posed to reinforcement learning by multiplayer video games, coupled with the adoption of more complex modeling strategies in social neuroscience, has broadened the interface between the two fields. Here, we review recent progress from both directions, arguing that advances in artificial intelligence provide neuroscientists with valuable tools for modeling social interactions. At the same time, the study of humans as efficient social learners can inform the design of new algorithms for multi-agent systems. We conclude by encouraging a joint approach that incorporates the best of both domains to advance a shared picture of social intelligence.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) has garnered significant attention as a means to enhance student science learning. However, researchers often broadly categorize GBL without specific attention to teachers' practices or the different game-based pedagogies (GBPs) such as serious game-based learning and learning by making games. Serious game-based learning involves the use of games designed primarily for purposes beyond entertainment, engaging students in learning activities. Learning by making games goes further by enabling students to construct and expand their knowledge through creative activities. Furthermore, the impact of students' weekly gaming hours on their academic performance under different GBPs has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-science unit assessment data to investigate the effects of serious game-based learning and learning by making games, along with gaming hours, on the science learning outcomes of 129 sixth-grade students in a Midwestern urban school district in the United States. Employing Bayesian paired t-tests and ANOVA, we examined the effects of two GBPs (serious game learning and game-making) implemented by two science teachers and the interaction between each GBP and students' weekly gaming hours. Our findings indicate that both GBPs led to improvements in students’ learning, with those participating in making games showing an average increase of 3.5 points more on the posttests than those engaged in serious game-based learning. Additionally, data on student-reported weekly gaming hours showed that in both GBP conditions, students with medium gaming hours showed the most improvement compared to those with fewer or more gaming hours. There was also a potential interaction between types of GBP and the effect of gaming hours outcomes in that the learning gain difference between the two GBPs was more pronounced among students reporting fewer gaming hours, although this effect was not significant. This study contributes to the GBL field by providing practical design recommendations for integrating GBL into formal Kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12) settings, taking into account teachers' pedagogical agency and students' gaming experiences.

AB  - Plastic and polymers are late entrants in the repository of engineering materials, compared to bronze and iron (early phases of human civilizations are named after them). However, the extent of usage of the former is growing at an exponential rate because of the near-infinite combinatorial possibilities. In fact, there are hardly few engineering disciplines that can potentially offer so large and endless unexploited possibilities. Plastic industries are widespread across the world due to their easy scalability, favorable economics and extremely diverse applications. Plastic manufacturing and recycling are especially important for the economy of a country and provide livelihood for a large population. It is imperative that the current processes in plastic be improved upon by the advantages offered by computational tools and digital technologies. At this stage, we desperately need new age tools that can properly guide the human enterprise of innovation in designing, perfection in processing while maintaining stringent quality requirements in manufacturing. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) perfectly fits this bill for the new age tools. We are at a very nascent stage of this AI/ML revolution. This article samples some of the pioneering works from the very discreet space of AI/ML applications in the field of plastic and polymer designing, processing and manufacturing and attempts to tie them up in a cohesive narrative. For the sake of completeness, applications of AI/ML for limiting the adverse environmental impact and future outlook have also been covered.

AB  - Although interdisciplinarity has become a favored model of scholarly inquiry, the assumption that interdisciplinary work is intuitive and can be performed without training is short-sighted. This article describes the implementation of an interdisciplinary research training program within a school of nursing. We describe the key elements of the program and the challenges we encountered. From 2007-2010, eleven trainees from 6 disciplines have been accepted into the program and 7 have completed the program; the trainees have published 12 manuscripts and presented at 10 regional or national meetings. The major challenge has been to sustain and “push the envelope” toward interdisciplinary thinking among the trainees and their mentors, and to assure that they do not revert to their “safer” disciplinary silos. This training program, funded by National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), has become well-established within the school of nursing and across the entire University campus, and is recognized as a high quality research training program across disciplines, as exemplified by excellent applicants from a number of disciplines.

KW  - Belief functions
KW  - Inference model
AB  - Statistical analysis of multinomial counts with a large number K of categories and a small number n of sample size is challenging to both frequentist and Bayesian methods and requires thinking about statistical inference at a very fundamental level. Following the framework of Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions, a probabilistic inferential model is proposed for this “large K and small n” problem. The inferential model produces a probability triplet (p,q,r) for an assertion conditional on observed data. The probabilities p and q are for and against the truth of the assertion, whereas r=1−p−q is the remaining probability called the probability of “donʼt know”. The new inference method is applied in a genome-wide association study with very high dimensional count data, to identify association between genetic variants to the disease Rheumatoid Arthritis.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) have attracted widespread attention in academia and industry in recent years. It can accurately reflect the physical world in real-time, enabling online monitoring, control, and prediction operations. Their foundation is super-real-time computing and high data representation capabilities. However, current DTs do not achieve 3D super-real-time computing. This study proposes a novel 3D computational method for solving fluid–solid coupling problems in a super-real-time. The method is based on a mixed solution framework that combines traditional numerical methods with deep learning operators. Specifically, the method employs multi-core CPU parallel acceleration to solve the solid equations while leveraging the computing power of GPU to solve the fluid equations. The fluid–solid coupling is achieved through information exchange between the GPU and the multi-core CPU. In addition, the proposed method introduces a new deep learning operator framework based on the DeepONET. The framework is accompanied by a database structure that facilitates model training and validation and a loss function that guides the training. The space nuclear reactor, an improved TOPAZ-II system, was selected to demonstrate its feasibility. Four non-training transient conditions were simulated to test the generalization performance. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average error between the calculated results and reference values below 2.5%, with the average error of thermodynamic parameters below 1.5%. The average deviation between system parameter peak values during the transient process and the reference value was less than 5 s. The result meets the acceptable error level and satisfies the super-real-time requirements with a time acceleration ratio of approximately 1.17, which is 60 times faster than traditional numerical methods. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for DT.

AB  - A review of biofuel production from supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of sustainable biomass has been performed, mainly organic waste, following a critical thinking in this field of knowledge. Thus, sub- and super- critical water properties and hydrothermal processing are briefly commented on. Then, the feedstocks usable in SCWG are fully reviewed and a brief description of the studies on the kinetics and mechanisms of reactions is carried out. Next, thermodynamic and process simulation are discussed, aimed at producing liquid and gas biofuels. After that, a brief comment on the viability of SCWG processes to produce biofuels is provided based on techno-economic and lifecycle assessments. Finally, some remarks on where we are and where we should go are given in order to advance this technology towards its maturity. This review explains some misleading concepts applied to SCWG processes, provides a brief but comprehensive overview of the technology focused on producing biofuels in a sustainable way, allows a better understanding of the SCWG of biomass for biofuel production, and proposes a series of improvements to be made and examined in the future research.

AB  - The archaeological record has been described as a key to the long-term consequences of human action that can help guide our decisions today. Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making.

AB  - The study aimed to develop a learning model that enhances Thai student-teacher problem-solving skills (PSS) and academic achievement (AA) through a blended problem-based learning (PBL) approach in online flipped classrooms. Phase 1 consisted of the design of the Flipped PARSER (problem-attempt-research-solutions-evaluation-reflect) Model (FPM) through the study of documentation and research. Phase 2 involved using nine experts to assist with the model's development and evaluation using in-depth interviews and content analysis. Phase 3 involved the application and use of the FPM by 30 student-teachers, from which their AA, PSS, and satisfaction were evaluated against the control group of 31 participants. The results from the nine experts' input on the FPM design were significant. Instructor activities included selecting content, media, materials, and their design and development. Other components included learning activities, tools, lesson delivery, and evaluation. Also, PBL methods were again confirmed as an instrumental pedagogy in teaching PSS. When combined with online learning and flipped classrooms, the study's results were higher than those using traditional classroom methods. The study contributes to the literature by determining that online teaching models effectively teach PSS and raise AA scores.

These models can enhance the style, creativity, and analytical power of research papers, potentially shifting human scholars' roles from creators to ‘prompters’. If machines can perform educational and research tasks more effectively the role of human educators becomes a salient question in a world in which ANLP models offer clear, coherent, and polished insights, the use of which has potentially paradoxical possibilities. From one perspective, a new type of high-quality scholarship and education characterized by strong human involvement that synergistically leverages ANLP models' analytical capabilities, enabling human scholars to probe complex phenomena and make management research truly meaningful and impactful for broader audiences, is possible. We explore these questions through an ‘ideal type’ conceptualization of the possible relations between AI and management education and research.

AB  - In recognition of the critical role of field observations in the ongoing development of our discipline, the 43rd annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) celebrated The Field Tradition in Geomorphology. By organizing a conference devoted to this theme, we sought to honor the contributions of pioneering, field-based geomorphologists and to encourage our community to contemplate how field work might continue to provide unique insight into a new, more technologically-driven era. For example, given recent advances in remote sensing methods such as LiDAR, what kind of added value can field work provide? Similarly, how can field-based studies contribute to societally relevant, large-scale questions related to climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system? Motivated by such questions, the 2012 BGS was convened in Jackson Hole, WY, a new, Western location that enabled participation by Rocky Mountain and west coast research groups underrepresented at previous Binghamton symposia. Also, in keeping with the field tradition theme, the 2012 BGS emphasized field trips, including a rafting excursion down the Snake River and an overview of the tectonic and glacial history of Jackson Hole. The on-site portion of the symposium consisted of invited oral and poster presentations and contributed posters, including many by graduate students. Topics ranged from an historical overview of the development of geomorphic thinking to long-term sediment tracer studies to a commentary on the synergy between LiDAR and field mapping. This special issue of Geomorphology consists of papers by invited authors from the 2012 BGS, and this overview provides some context for these contributions. Looking forward, we hope that the 43rd annual BGS will stimulate further discussion of the role of field work as the discipline of geomorphology continues to evolve, carrying on the field tradition into the future.

AB  - An increasing number of academic senior physicians are approaching their potential retirement in good health with accumulated clinical and research experience that can be a valuable asset to an academic institution. Considering the need to let the next generation ascend to leadership roles, when and how should a medical career be brought to a close? We explore the roles for academic medical faculty as they move into their senior years and approach various retirement options. The individual and institutional considerations require a frank dialogue among the interested parties to optimize the benefits while minimizing the risks for both. In the United States there is no fixed age for retirement as there is in Europe, but European physicians are initiating changes. What is certain is that careful planning, innovative thinking, and the incorporation of new patterns of medical practice are all part of this complex transition and timing of senior academic physicians into retirement.

AB  - Procrastination refers to an irrationally delay for intended courses of action despite of anticipating a negative consequence due to this delay. Previous studies tried to reveal the neural substrates of procrastination in terms of connectome-based biomarkers. Based on this, we proposed a unified triple brain network model for procrastination and pinpointed out what challenges we are facing in understanding neural mechanism of procrastination. Specifically, based on neuroanatomical features, the unified triple brain network model proposed that connectome-based underpinning of procrastination could be ascribed to the abnormalities of self-control network (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), emotion-regulation network (i.e., orbital frontal cortex, OFC), and episodic prospection network (i.e., para-hippocampus cortex, PHC). Moreover, based on the brain functional features, procrastination had been attributed to disruptive neural circuits on FPN (frontoparietal network)-SCN (subcortical network) and FPN-SAN (salience network), which led us to hypothesize the crucial roles of interplay between these networks on procrastination in unified triple brain network model. Despite of these findings, poor interpretability and computational model limited further understanding for procrastination from theoretical and neural perspectives. On balance, the current study provided an overview to show current progress on the connectome-based biomarkers for procrastination, and proposed the integrative neurocognitive model of procrastination.

AB  - At a time when pseudoscience threatens the survival of communities, understanding this vulnerability, and how to reduce it, is paramount. Four preregistered experiments (N = 532, N = 472, N = 605, N = 382) with online U.S. samples introduced false claims concerning a (fictional) virus created as a bioweapon, mirroring conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and carcinogenic effects of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). We identify two critical determinants of vulnerability to pseudoscience. First, participants who trust science are more likely to believe and disseminate false claims that contain scientific references than false claims that do not. Second, reminding participants of the value of critical evaluation reduces belief in false claims, whereas reminders of the value of trusting science do not. We conclude that trust in science, although desirable in many ways, makes people vulnerable to pseudoscience. These findings have implications for science broadly and the application of psychological science to curbing misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background
The search for valid information was one of the main challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the development of several online alternatives.
Objectives
To describe the development of a computational solution to interact with users of different levels of digital literacy on topics related to COVID-19 and to map the correlations between user behavior and events and news that occurred throughout the pandemic.
Method
CoronaAI, a chatbot based on Google's Dialogflow technology, was developed at a public university in Brazil and made available on WhatsApp. The dataset with users’ interactions with the chatbot comprises approximately 7,000 hits recorded throughout eleven months of CoronaAI usage.
Results
CoronaAI was widely accessed by users in search of valuable and updated information on COVID-19, including checking the veracity of possible fake news about the spread of cases, deaths, symptoms, tests and protocols, among others. The mapping of users' behavior revealed that as the number of cases and deaths increased and as COVID-19 became closer, users showed a greater need for information applicable to self-care compared to following the statistical data. In addition, they showed that the constant updating of this technology may contribute to public health by enhancing general information on the pandemic and at the individual level by clarifying specific doubts about COVID-19.
Conclusion
Our findings reinforce the potential usefulness of chatbot technology to resolve a wide spectrum of citizens' doubts about COVID-19, acting as a cost-effective tool against the parallel pandemic of misinformation and fake news.

AB  - This paper presents a robust fault detection method using a zonotopic Kaucher set-membership method. The fault detection approach is based on checking the consistency between the model and the data. Consistency is given if there is an intersection between the feasible parameter set and the nominal parameter set. To allow efficient computation the feasible set is approximated by a zonotope. Due to the usage of Kaucher interval arithmetic the results are mathematically guaranteed. The proposed approach is assessed using an illustrative application based on a well-known four-tank case study. The study shows that it is possible to detect even small errors in a noisy setting.

AB  - Precision is the ultimate goal of safety management. Over the past few decades, technological advances and applications (e.g., advances and applications of information technology) in safety management and its research have given safety managers the ability to pursue and realize relatively precise safety management based on sufficient and precise safety information. It can be said that safety management has entered the precision era. Therefore, in the present and future, developing novel approaches to precise prevention and control of safety risks is an inevitable safety management trend. This paper proposed a new and promising approach to safety management called precision safety management (PSM). The main objective of this paper was to answer the following five basic questions regarding PSM from a theoretical perspective: (i) What is PSM? (ii) Why is it necessary to develop PSM? (iii) What are the relationships between PSM and other concepts? (iv) What does PSM do? (v) How does an organization use PSM? Additionally, this paper presented the application of the PSM approach to the precise prevention and control of safety risks in a chemical industrial park as a case study. The main contributions of this paper are a theoretical framework for PSM, and a practical case for PSM. This study can help researchers and practitioners understand PSM and lay the foundation for its future research and practice.

AB  - We present a computational study of network ensembles with two types of coexisting vehicle classes: an altruistically routing vehicle (ARV) class – potentially automated vehicles that are routed to reduce total system travel time – and a selfishly routing vehicle (SRV) class, corresponding to human-driven vehicles. We investigate the performance of these networks when some links are reserved for exclusive use by the ARVs. The goal of these interventions is to avoid or mitigate the detrimental effects of the SRVs on the costs of the ARVs. We formulate the problem as a bi-level network design problem, where the upper level deals with optimising the choice of ARV-exclusive links minimising the statistical dispersion of used-route costs, while the lower level finds the corresponding traffic equilibrium under static traffic assignment conditions. We tackle the ARV-exclusive link selection with a genetic algorithm, where the fitness of solutions is based on the dispersion of the costs of routes used by ARVs. The mixed equilibrium is found by solving a multi-class static traffic assignment problem, with constraints on the SRV flows on the ARV-exclusive links. SRVs attempt to minimise their personal travel time, whilst ARVs attempt to drive the flows to system optimal. Our approach is effective in reducing the per-vehicle travel cost of the ARVs to below that of the SRVs, making altruistic routing a more attractive option on average. Our results are consistent across networks with different structures and demand levels.

AB  - Conventional metaphor, irony, and literal language processing were compared. Thirty right-handed participants (21–34 years) performed a sequential-statement ERP-paradigm. A left-frontal Late Anterior Negative Slow Wave (LANSW, 450–1000 ms) was significantly greater for metaphors and by visual tendency greater for irony, compared to literal statements. A centroparietal N400 (300–450 ms) and a centroparietal right-dominant “Late N400” (450–600 ms) were by statistical and visual tendency greater for metaphors. Left PCC and left lingual gyrus activity was significantly higher in metaphors compared to literal statements (eLORETA; 450–1000 ms). A statistical trend indicated higher parahippocampal gyrus activity in metaphors and ironies. N400 results are discussed considering changing processing techniques and a renewed semantic conflict. The Late N400 was associated with the construct of “associativeness”. The LANSW was related to metaphorical mapping, frame-shifting processes, integration of meanings, and memory processes. eLORETA results were discussed considering metaphorical mapping, creation of mental images, conventionality, valence, memory processes, and divergent thinking.

AB  - We report on the generation of maximally localized photonic Wannier functions under constraints. This allows us to impress certain symmetry properties of the underlying Photonic Crystal onto the Wannier functions. This added flexibility enhances the utility of the Wannier function approach to Photonic Crystal circuits by providing deeper physical insight and making computations more efficient.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a persistent neurological disorder profoundly affecting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions, prominently characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disordered speech, and abnormal motor activity. These symptoms often present diagnostic challenges due to their overlap with other forms of psychosis. Therefore, the implementation of automated diagnostic methodologies is imperative. This research leverages Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a neuroimaging modality capable of delineating functional activations across diverse brain regions. Furthermore, the utilization of evolving machine learning techniques for fMRI data analysis has significantly progressive. Here, our study stands as a novel attempt, focusing on the comprehensive assessment of both classical and atypical symptoms of schizophrenia. We aim to uncover associated changes in brain functional activity. Our study encompasses two distinct fMRI datasets (1.5T and 3T), each comprising 34 schizophrenia patients for the 1.5T dataset and 25 schizophrenia patients for the 3T dataset, along with an equal number of healthy controls. Machine learning algorithms are applied to assess data subsets, enabling an in-depth evaluation of the current functional condition concerning symptom impact. The identified voxels contribute to determining the brain regions most influenced by each symptom, as quantified by symptom intensity. This rigorous approach has yielded various new findings while maintaining an impressive classification accuracy rate of 97 %. By elucidating variations in activation patterns across multiple brain regions in individuals with schizophrenia, this study contributes to the understanding of functional brain changes associated with the disorder. The insights gained may inform differential clinical interventions and provide a means of assessing symptom severity accurately, offering new avenues for the management of schizophrenia.
