AB  - The use of model membranes is currently part of the daily workflow for many biochemical and biophysical disciplines. These membranes are used to analyze the behavior of small substances, to simulate transport processes, to study the structure of macromolecules or for illustrative purposes. But, how can these membrane structures be generated? This mini review discusses a number of ways to obtain these structures. First, the problem will be formulated as the Membrane Packing Problem. It will be shown that the theoretical problem of placing proteins and lipids onto a membrane area differ significantly. Thus, two sub-problems will be defined and discussed. Then, different – partly historical – membrane modeling methods will be introduced. And finally, membrane modeling tools will be evaluated which are able to semi-automatically generate these model membranes and thus, drastically accelerate and simplify the membrane generation process. The mini review concludes with advice about which tool is appropriate for which application case.

AB  - Metaphor has had a prolific presence in sociology: as a subject of empirical study, as a tool for theorizing, and as ideas that live public lives beyond the ivory tower. Despite all this work, tracing the core dynamics of metaphors over time remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, I propose a systematic analysis of metaphor anchored around four core questions. What do metaphors describe? How do metaphors change over time? What do metaphors do? And how do conventional metaphors emerge? I address these questions in the context of one persistent and prolific metaphor: the network metaphor. To do so, I offer a formal model of the career of metaphor by drawing on cognitive linguistics and sociological theories of public ideas and professional careers. Specifically, I integrate the Google Books Ngram corpus with computational techniques that leverage co-occurrence to visualize and interpret the career of the network metaphor with respect to four areas: its jurisdiction, temporality, ecology, and conventionality. I leverage the network metaphor as both a revelatory case for evaluating my model and a critical case for deepening our historical understanding of the network. My analysis lends validation to the argument that the network metaphor has achieved the status of a broad category for thinking about contemporary life. However, it also demonstrates that the network metaphor had a lively history prior to the twentieth century. This includes significant changes in how it was used in the first half of the nineteenth century, a career standing in for anatomical structures of the body in the mid-nineteenth century, and a predominant expression in simile form prior to the start of the twentieth century.

AB  - In this chapter, we describe how computational biology can be aided by informatics infrastructure to provide the basis for in silico studies that no longer require the generation of data, and instead facilitate the collection, organization, and analysis of existing datasets that can drive discovery. A new reality is that we are awash in data and tools to analyze these data and one of the most significant challenges is that of enabling the researcher to discover datasets relevant to their work, collect these data, assess its quality, and analyze it. The development of an adequate infrastructure within a researcher’s institution greatly facilitates progress on this front, both in terms of the development of tools and the development of local informatics expertise necessary to complement the domain-specific expertise of the researcher. As an informatics community we often ponder the heterogeneity of tools and resources on a global scale at the expense of the more immediate local problems encountered on a routine basis. Here, we suggest that getting our own houses in order by first employing interoperable solutions that support and facilitate collaboration amongst the complementary disciplines within our own institutions places the informatics community in a better position to address global informatics challenges. This approach can ensure that the solutions implemented employ an architecture and standards that support interoperability. Indeed, this is an organizational and cultural challenge rather than a technological one. Organizational structure and practices are described that provide a comprehensive base of talent capable of creating an environment that supports a sustainable informatics infrastructure, and that can quickly grow as needed to support the specific and rapidly evolving needs unique to that institution.

AB  - This paper proposes a big data integrated framework to assist with prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, TB and silicosis (HATS) in the mining industry. The linkage between HATS presents a major challenge to the mining industry globally. When the immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS and silicosis, it makes it easier for tuberculosis to infect the body. In addition, the silica dust which affects the lungs may also cause silicosis and tuberculosis. The objective of this paper is to posit a big data integrated framework to assist in the prevention and control of HATS in the mining industry. Literature was reviewed in order to build a conceptual framework. Although this study is not the first to apply big data in healthcare, to the researcher's knowledge, it is the first to apply big data in understanding the linkage between HATS in the mining industry. The literature review indicates only a few studies using big data in healthcare with no research found on big data and HATS. It therefore makes a contribution to existing body of literature on the control of HATS. The proposed big data framework has the potential of addressing the needs of predictive epidemiology which is important in forecasting and disease control in the mining industry. The paper therefore lays a foundation for the use of viable systems model and big data to address the challenges of HATS in the mining industry. As part of future work, the framework will be validated using sequential explanatory mixed methods case study approach in mining organizations.

AB  - The past few decades have established how digital technologies and platforms have provided an effective medium for spreading hateful content, which has been linked to several catastrophic consequences. Recent academic studies have also highlighted how online hate is a phenomenon that strategically makes use of multiple online platforms. In this article, we seek to advance the current research landscape by harnessing a cross-platform approach to computationally analyse content relating to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we analyse content on hate-specific environments from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan and Stormfront. Our findings show how content and posting activity can change across platforms, and how the psychological components of online content can differ depending on the platform being used. Through this, we provide unique insight into the cross-platform behaviours of online hate. We further define several avenues for future research within this field so as to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global hate ecosystem.

AB  - This research investigates the effective incorporation of the human factor and user perception in text-based interactive media. In such contexts, the reliability of user texts is often compromised by behavioural and emotional dimensions. To this end, several attempts have been made in the state of the art, to introduce psychological approaches in such systems, including computational psycholinguistics, personality traits and cognitive psychology methods. In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a psychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian discourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive) characteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their reliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods are systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic framework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it addresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and expression which usually escape methods functioning at “higher”, conscious layers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of psychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse applications. To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake news detection; we first demonstrate certain limitations of the well-known Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type method, and then propose and evaluate our new method of analysing user texts and detecting fake news based on the Lacanian discourses psychoanalytic approach.

AB  - This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.

AB  - Quantum versions of random walks on the line and the cycle show a quadratic improvement over classical random walks in their spreading rates and mixing times, respectively. Non-unitary quantum walks can provide a useful optimisation of these properties, producing a more uniform distribution on the line, and faster mixing times on the cycle. We investigate the interplay between quantum and random dynamics by comparing the resources required, and examining numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk. We show numerically that the optimal non-unitary quantum walk proceeds such that the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final measurement. This requires only O(logT) random bits for a quantum walk of T steps.

AB  - Over the last decades, anti-seismic devices have gained increasing interest in the civil engineering field. The introduction of the base isolation system has led to a new concept in the construction panorama in terms of human life safety, a new way of thinking on new constructions, improvement and retrofitting on existent structures. Therefore, rubber and friction isolators have been deeply investigated to hence performances and predict dynamic behaviour during an earthquake. While the response of the former is characterised by the composition of the elastomeric compound, the latter features special materials able to dissipate energy by moving on smooth surfaces. This paper focuses on friction pendulum devices and addresses its attention on the behaviour of sliding materials. It is well-known that stick-slip phenomenon occurs when friction excitation is present and, in the anti-seismic field is important to reduce it and have a well-representative mathematical law able to describe it. Therefore, Hirun International after performing several treatments of the sliding materials has set up a special processing to guarantee a stable response of the HI-M material used on pendulum devices. The paper, after a brief presentation of the special sliding material, shows a comparison between the material with and without the treatment in terms of the force-displacement law. The paper also analyses in detail the cinematic behaviour of the sliding pendulum with one or two main sliding surfaces, with and without central articulation and determines the stress distribution in the sliding surfaces for the different cases.

A theoretically pluralist approach is utilised combining complexity thinking with a multiple streams approach. The analysis demonstrates that the context of educational development cooperation is ambiguous and complex. Influencing policymaking is a strategic, non-linear task which takes time, resources, and personal skills. Policy entrepreneurs need to understand the dynamics of development cooperation, identify actors that trust them, and recognise when policy windows are likely to open.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter examines the challenges and some of the recent advances in computational systems biology. Research in computational systems biology has moved beyond interaction networks based simply on clustering and correlation. There are two paradigms in computational systems biology: the iterative cycle of biochemical model—mathematical model—computational model, and integration of novel data and legacy knowledge to develop context-specific biochemical, mathematical, and computational models. Challenges in building biochemical models include the complexity of proteomic states and interactions, integration of diverse data to infer biochemical interactions, and the temporal state of biochemical models. Challenges in building mathematical models include incorporating statistical/probabilistic information into analytical models, using qualitative constraints in mathematical models, and incomplete knowledge and coarse-graining. Challenges in computational modeling include the absence of knowledge about model parameters such as rate constants, local versus global concentrations of species and multiple scales of distance and time, and variation among different cell types and subpopulation variability, or variability among biological repeats. Advanced research in coarse graining will pave the way for progress in the development of multiscale multidomain modeling that can connect fundamental research in network biology to clinical research.

A series of vented gas explosion layouts with different separation gaps between tanks were experimentally investigated. In order to qualitatively determine the relationship between the separation gap distance and explosion pressure, intensive computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, verified with testing data, were conducted. Good agreement between CFD simulation results and experimental data was achieved. By using CFD simulation, more gas explosion cases were included to consider different gas cloud coverage scenarios. Separation gap effects on internal and external pressures at various locations were investigated.

AB  - Abstract
One of the major computational challenges that online businesses face today is to make sense of huge amount of information. Granular computing has emerged as an important conceptual and computational paradigm of information processing. As an emerging field of study, it has been suggested that granular computing at philosophical level concerns with structural thinking and at the application level concerns with structured problem solving. It has been further suggested that fuzzy information granulation, as a special case of granular computing, is likely to play an important role in the evolution of fuzzy logic and may eventually have a far-reaching impact on its applications. Responding to the calls for future studies dealing with the applications of fuzzy information granulation, this paper presents an application of the theory of fuzzy information granulation in an emerging and important area where there has not yet been any application, showing how online sports services can make sense of huge amount of data in a structured way and how they can structure their decisions. The empirical results show that despite the huge amount of data that needs to be processed, fuzzy information granulation can help online sports services make sense of it and identify meaningful granules for easier decision making.

AB  - Schools are increasingly integrating character education to facilitate improved moral thinking and pro social behavior among students. An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes. However, schools are rarely able to use animated vignettes since existing tools do not allow them to be easily created and having them created externally is overly expensive. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool's multimedia features are often used and well-liked. Educators can download and use our tool while researchers can draw upon our design rationale and lessons learned when building similar tools.

AB  - Increasingly, decision makers seek to harness “big data” to guide choices in management and policy settings as well as in professions that manufacture, build, and innovate. Scholars examining this trend tend to diagnose it at once as techno positivist in its insistence on design yoked to quantifiable variables and computational modeling and, alternatively, as an imperative integral to realizing ecologically sustainable innovation. This article investigates this tension. It reflects on the role of futurists, designers, architects, urban planners, social scientists, and artists in interpreting and utilizing comprehensiveness as a design frame. Among nine experimental foresight workshops at the inaugural Emerge conference at Arizona State University, many focused on producing physical objects or media, one modeled and expanded upon a method pioneered by architect and polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. At a time when many of the capabilities to realize Fuller's specifications for big data have matured, I investigate whether comprehensive design as framed by Fuller's method shows promise as a trend enabling ecologically sustainable innovations. A historical look at Fuller's Design Science and the reflection on it in the Emerge workshop marks an opportunity to highlight and interpret the resurgence of comprehensive thinking in design while navigating the contradictions this orientation engenders.

AB  - For twenty years the Nuprl (“new pearl”) system has been used to develop software systems and formal theories of computational mathematics. It has also been used to explore and implement computational type theory (CTT)—a formal theory of computation closely related to Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory (ITT) and to the calculus of inductive constructions (CIC) implemented in the Coq prover. This article focuses on the theory and practice underpinning our use of Nuprl for much of the last decade. We discuss innovative elements of type theory, including new type constructors such as unions and dependent intersections, our theory of classes, and our theory of event structures. We also discuss the innovative architecture of Nuprl as a distributed system and as a transactional database of formal mathematics using the notion of abstract object identifiers. The database has led to an independent project called the Formal Digital Library, FDL, now used as a repository for Nuprl results as well as selected results from HOL, MetaPRL, and PVS. We discuss Howe's set theoretic semantics that is used to relate such disparate theories and systems as those represented by these provers.

AB  - Background and objective
Music, the ubiquitous language across human cultures, is traditionally considered as a form of art but has been linked to biomolecules in recent years. However, previous efforts have only been addressed on sonification of nucleic acids and proteins to produce so-called life music, the soundscape from the basic building blocks of life. In this study, we attempted to, for the first time, conduct a reverse operation of this process, i.e. conversion of music to protein (CoMtP).
Methods
A novel notion termed musical protein (MP) –– the protein defined by music –– was proposed and, on this basis, we described a computational strategy to map the time sequence of music onto the spatial architecture of proteins, which considered that each note in the stave of a music (target) can be simply characterized by two acoustical quantities and that each residue in the primary sequence of a protein (hit) was represented by amino acid descriptors.
Results
A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm was applied to iteratively generate the best matched MP hit for a music target and structural bioinformatics was then used to model spatial advanced structure for the resulting MP. We also demonstrated that some small MPs derived from music segments may have potential biological functions, which, for example, can serve as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to inhibit clinical bacterial strains with moderate or high antibacterial potency.
Conclusions
This work may benefit many aspects; for example, it would open a door for the hearing-impaired persons to ‘listen’ music in a biological vision and could be a mean of exposing students to the concepts of biomolecules at an earlier age through the use of auditory characteristics. The CoMtP would also facilitate the rational design of proteins with biological and medicinal significance.

AB  - Background
Persecutory delusions are among the most common delusions in schizophrenia and represent the extreme end of the paranoia continuum. Paranoia is accompanied by significant worry and distress. Identifying cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia is critical for advancing treatment. We hypothesized that aberrant belief updating, which is related to paranoia in human and animal models, would also contribute to persecutory beliefs in individuals with schizophrenia.
Methods
Belief updating was assessed in 42 participants with schizophrenia and 44 healthy control participants using a 3-option probabilistic reversal learning task. Hierarchical Gaussian Filter was used to estimate computational parameters of belief updating. Paranoia was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale. Unusual thought content was measured with the Psychosis Symptom Rating Scale and the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Worry was measured using the Dunn Worry Questionnaire.
Results
Paranoia was significantly associated with elevated win-switch rate and prior beliefs about volatility both in schizophrenia and across the whole sample. These relationships were specific to paranoia and did not extend to unusual thought content or measures of anxiety. We observed a significant indirect effect of paranoia on the relationship between prior beliefs about volatility and worry.
Conclusions
This work provides evidence that relationships between belief updating parameters and paranoia extend to schizophrenia, may be specific to persecutory beliefs, and contribute to theoretical models implicating worry in the maintenance of persecutory delusions.

AB  - Human brain imaging typically employs structured and controlled tasks to avoid variable and inconsistent activation patterns. Here we expand this assumption by showing that an extremely open-ended, high-level cognitive task of thinking about an abstract content, loosely defined as “abstract thinking” - leads to highly consistent activation maps. Specifically, we show that activation maps generated during such cognitive process were precisely located relative to borders of well-known networks such as internal speech, visual and motor imagery. The activation patterns allowed decoding the thought condition at >95%. Surprisingly, the activated networks remained the same regardless of changes in thought content. Finally, we found remarkably consistent activation maps across individuals engaged in abstract thinking. This activation bordered, but strictly avoided visual and motor networks. On the other hand, it overlapped with left lateralized language networks. Activation of the default mode network (DMN) during abstract thought was similar to DMN activation during rest. These observations were supported by a quantitative neuronal distance metric analysis. Our results reveal that despite its high level, and varied content nature - abstract thinking activates surprisingly precise and consistent networks in participants’ brains.

AB  - Using computational methods to produce and interpret multiple scientific representations is now a common practice in many science disciplines. Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation.

AB  - Fine-tuning and inference on Large Language Models like BERT have become increasingly expensive regarding memory cost and computation resources. The recently proposed computation-flexible BERT models facilitate their deployment in varied computational environments. Training such flexible BERT models involves jointly optimizing multiple BERT subnets, which will unavoidably interfere with one another. Besides, the performance of large subnets is limited by the performance gap between the smallest subnet and the supernet, despite efforts to enhance the smaller subnets. In this regard, we propose layer-wise Neural grafting to boost BERT subnets, especially the larger ones. The proposed method improves the average performance of the subnets on six GLUE tasks and boosts the supernets on all GLUE tasks and the SQuAD data set. Based on the boosted subnets, we further build an inference framework enabling practical width- and depth-dynamic inference regarding different inputs by combining width-dynamic gating modules and early exit off-ramps in the depth dimension. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a better dynamic inference range than other methods in terms of trading off performance and computational complexity on four GLUE tasks and SQuAD. In particular, our best-tradeoff inference result outperforms other fixed-size models with similar amount of computations. Compared to BERT-Base, the proposed inference framework yields a 1.3-point improvement in the average GLUE score and a 2.2-point increase in the F1 score on SQuAD, while reducing computations by around 45%.

AB  - Previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between students’ use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies and their performance in introductory programming courses. These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students’ online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities.

AB  - Wishful thinking, defined as the tendency to over-estimate the probability of high-payoff outcomes, is a widely-documented phenomenon that can affect decision-making across numerous domains, including finance, management, and entrepreneurship. We design an experiment to distinguish and test the relationship between two easily-confounded biases, optimism and overconfidence, both of which can contribute to wishful thinking. We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis. Our findings have potential implications for the design of information interventions since how agents incorporate information depends on whether the bias is ego-related.

AB  - During face-to-face interactions typically developing individuals use gaze aversion (GA), away from their questioner, when thinking. GA is also used when individuals with autism (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS) are thinking during question-answer interactions. We investigated GA strategies during face-to-face social style interactions with familiar and unfamiliar interlocutors. Participants with WS and ASD used overall typical amounts/patterns of GA with all participants looking away most while thinking and remembering (in contrast to listening and speaking). However there were a couple of specific disorder related differences: participants with WS looked away less when thinking and interacting with unfamiliar interlocutors; in typical development and WS familiarity was associated with reduced gaze aversion, however no such difference was evident in ASD. Results inform typical/atypical social and cognitive phenotypes. We conclude that gaze aversion serves some common functions in typical and atypical development in terms of managing the cognitive and social load of interactions. There are some specific idiosyncracies associated with managing familiarity in ASD and WS with elevated sociability with unfamiliar others in WS and a lack of differentiation to interlocutor familiarity in ASD. Regardless of the familiarity of the interlocutor, GA is associated with thinking for typically developing as well as atypically developing groups. Social skills training must take this into account.

AB  - Intramolecular net [2 + 2] cycloadditions between benzyne intermediates and an electron-deficient alkene to give benzocyclobutene intermediates are relatively rare. Benzynes are electrophilic and generally engage nucleophiles or electron-rich π-systems. We describe here reactions in which an alkene of a tethered enone traps thermally generated benzynes in a variety of interesting ways. The number of atoms that link the benzyne to C4 of a cyclohexa-2,5-dienone induces varying amounts of strain in the intermediates and products. This leads to a variety of different reaction outcomes by way of various strain-releasing events that are mechanistically intriguing. This work demonstrates an underappreciated class of strain that originates from the adjacent fusion of two rings to both C1–C2 and C2–C3 of a benzenoid ring – i.e. ‘ortho-annulation strain’. DFT computations shed considerable light on the mechanistic diversions among various reaction pathways as well as allow more fundamental evaluation of the strain in a homologous series of ortho-annulated carbocycles.

AB  - The ripple effect measures impact, or how likely it is that a change to a particular module may cause problems in the rest of a program. It can also be used as an indicator of the complexity of a particular module or program. Central to this paper is a reformulation in terms of matrix arithmetic of the original ripple effect algorithm produced by Yau and Collofello in 1978. The main aim of the reformulation is to clarify the component parts of the algorithm making the calculation more explicit. The reformulated algorithm has been used to implement REST (Ripple Effect and Stability Tool) which produces ripple effect measures for C programs. This paper describes the reformulation of Yau and Collofello’s ripple effect algorithm focusing on the computation of matrix Zm which holds intramodule change propagation information. The reformulation of the ripple effect algorithm is validated using fifteen programs which have been grouped by type. Due to the approximation spurious 1s are contained within matrix Zm. It is discussed whether this has an impact on the accuracy of the reformulated algorithm. The conclusion of this research is that the approximated algorithm is valid and as such can replace Yau and Collofello’s original algorithm.

Both the required knowledge and the database of hydrostatic guideways are modelled using ontologies to provide a consensual understanding among collaborators. Moreover, a formalized knowledge searching interface is developed to obtain similar instances as references according to the design principles and rules. Based on the imaginal thinking theory, the search process and the results are attempted to be presented in the form of image in order to fit human's customary intuitive thinking frame, facilitating the decision making process. Finally, our design of hydrostatic guideways for an ultra-precision grinding machine is used to validate the effectiveness of the method.

Unlocking the potential of microbial communities in the rhizosphere and endosphere is therefore of great interest for sustainable agriculture advancements. Before plant microbiomes can be engineered to confer desirable phenotypic effects on their plant hosts, a deeper understanding of the interacting factors influencing rhizosphere community structure and function is needed. Dealing with this complexity is becoming more feasible using computational approaches. In this review, we discuss recent advances at the intersection of experimental and computational strategies for the investigation of plant–microbiome interactions and the engineering of desirable soil microbiomes.

AB  - A mechanism underlying the computational properties of the cognitive architecture is construed based on a minimal list of operational clusters. This general processing mechanism constitutes the dynamic infrastructure of mind (DIM). DIM consists in categories of mental operations foundational for learning that contain inborn components called inner operations, which are self-developing in the interaction mind-environment. Within the DIM paradigm, the input cognitive systems are not domain specific or core-knowledge specific, they are operational specific and capable of further developments that become domain specific while experiencing the environment. Arguments for this construal come from three sources: literature review, data collected through classroom observations, and a four-year experimental study of teaching and learning mathematics in primary grades. The outcomes of that experiment led to a methodology of learning based on activating the operational infrastructure of mind, which enhances students' flexibility of thinking and predicts the capacity to solve creatively a variety of problems.

KW  - Trailing-edge noise
KW  - Aeroacoustics
KW  - Turbulent boundary layer
AB  - When the pressure fluctuations caused by turbulence vorticity in the boundary layer are scattered by a sharp trailing edge, acoustic energy is generated and propagated to the far field. This trailing edge noise is emitted from aircraft wings, turbomachinery blades, wind turbine blades, helicopter blades, etc. Being dominant at high frequencies, this trailing-edge noise is a key element that annoys human hearing. This article covers virtually the entire landscape of modern research into trailing-edge noise including theoretical developments, numerical simulations, wind tunnel experiments, and applications of trailing-edge noise. The theoretical approach includes Green’s function formulations, Wiener–Hopf methods that solve the mixed boundary-value problem, Howe’s and Amiet’s models that relate the wall pressure spectrum to acoustic radiation. Recent analytical developments for poroelasticity and serrations are also included. We discuss a hierarchy of numerical approaches that range from semi-empirical schemes that estimate the wall pressure spectrum using mean-flow and turbulence statistics to high-fidelity unsteady flow simulations such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) that resolve the sound generation and scattering process based on the first-principles flow physics. Wind tunnel experimental research that provided benchmark data for numerical simulations and unravel flow physics is reviewed. In each theoretical, numerical, and experimental approach, noise control methods for mitigating trailing-edge noise are discussed. Finally, highlights of practical applications of trailing-edge noise prediction and reduction to wind turbine noise, fan noise, and rotorcraft noise are given. The current challenges in each approach are summarized with a look toward the future developments. The review could be useful as a primer for new researchers or as a reference point to the state of the art for experienced professionals.

AB  - The last decade consolidated the cyberspace as fifth domain of military operations, which extends its preliminarily intelligence and information exchange purposes towards enabling complex offensive and defensive operations supported/supportively of parallel kinetic domain actuations. Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that Tactical Clouds disruptively facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military Tactical Clouds at their cyber edge. Along with a 1) comprehensively formulation of the researched problematic, the study 2) formalizes the Tactical Denial of Sustainability (TDoS) concept; 3) introduces the phasing, potential attack surfaces, terrains and impact of TDoS attacks; 4) emphasizes the related human and socio-technical aspects; 5) analyzes the threats/opportunities inherent to their impact on the cloud energy efficiency; 6) reviews their implications at the military cyber thinking for tactical operations; 7) illustrates five extensive CONOPS that facilitate the understanding of the TDoS concept; and given the high novelty of the discussed topics, this paper 8) paves the way for further research and development actions.

AB  - According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), climate change is exponentially affecting agricultural production worldwide, with food prices expected to increase by up to 90 percent by 2030 and hunger and malnutrition rates to rise by 2050. This paper presents the development of a platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for monitoring urban gardens as a strategy to mitigate hunger, promote food sovereignty and circular economy in areas of food shortage. To this end, an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture is proposed and implemented that involves a social design layer that allows an effective transfer of knowledge to communities and a recommendation system based on evolutionary computation to optimize and maximize the productivity of urban orchards, and thus contribute to the 2030 agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Finally, three experiments in urban gardens are shown to validate evolutionary computation and artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression, genetic algorithms, ant colony algorithms and spatial estimation and inference algorithms such as the Kriging algorithm. The productivity of urban lettuce orchards is increased between 25 and 45%.

KW  - Abstraction
KW  - Heuristic search
KW  - Planning
AB  - Abstraction is a powerful technique for speeding up planning and search. A problem that can arise in using abstraction is the generation of abstract states, called spurious states, from which the goal state is reachable in the abstract space but for which there is no corresponding state in the original space from which the goal state can be reached. Spurious states can be harmful, in practice, because they can create artificial shortcuts in the abstract space that slow down planning and search, and they can greatly increase the memory needed to store heuristic information derived from the abstract space (e.g., pattern databases). This paper analyzes the computational complexity of creating abstractions that do not contain spurious states. We define a property—the downward path preserving property (DPP)—that formally captures the notion that an abstraction does not result in spurious states. We then analyze the computational complexity of (i) testing the downward path preserving property for a given state space and abstraction and of (ii) determining whether this property is achievable at all for a given state space. The strong hardness results shown carry over to typical description languages for planning problems, including sas+ and propositional strips. On the positive side, we identify and illustrate formal conditions under which finding downward path preserving abstractions is provably tractable.

AB  - Learning can take place everywhere: in the home, the community, or at work. Learning outside school is often invisible because it is taken for granted, as common sense or cultural knowledge. It happens in the course of activities not designed for learning, so it can be described as thinking in action. The representational tools (number systems, graphs) and objects (crates, coins, bills) used outside school become part of our thinking as we act and think with them. A major process in learning outside school is guided participation, where learners take responsibility for accomplishing tasks guided by a more experienced person.

AB  - The processes of diagnosis and management involve clinical decision-making. However, decision-making is often affected by cognitive biases that can lead to medical errors. This statement presents a framework of clinical thinking and decision-making and shows how these processes can be bias-prone. We review examples of cognitive bias in obstetrics and introduce debiasing tools and strategies. When an adverse event or near miss is reviewed, the concept of a cognitive autopsy—a root cause analysis of medical decision-making and the potential influence of cognitive biases—is promoted as part of the review process. Finally, areas for future research on cognitive bias in obstetrics are suggested.

AB  - Self-regulative behaviors are dynamic and evolve as a function of time and context. However, dynamical fluctuations in behaviors are often difficult to measure and therefore may not be fully captured by traditional measures alone. Utilizing system log data and two novel statistical methodologies, this study examined emergent patterns of controlled and regulated behaviors and assessed how variations in these patterns related to individual differences in prior literacy ability and target skill acquisition. Conditional probabilities and Entropy analyses were used to examine nuanced patterns manifested in students’ interaction choices within a computer-based learning environment. Forty high school students interacted with the game-based intelligent tutoring system iSTART-ME, for a total of 11 sessions (pretest, 8 training sessions, posttest, and a delayed retention test). Results revealed that high and low reading ability students differed in their patterns of interactions and the amount of control they exhibited within the game-based system. However, these differences converged overtime along with differences in students’ performance within iSTART-ME. The findings from this study indicate that individual differences in students’ prior reading ability relate to the emergence of controlled and regulated behaviors during learning tasks.

KW  - Precursors of creativity
KW  - Infancy
KW  - Measurements of creativity
AB  - Creativity is an important skill that relates to innovation, problem-solving and artistic achievement. However, relatively little is known about the early development of creative potential in very young children, in part due to a paucity of tasks suitable for use during infancy. Current measures of creativity in early childhood include the Unusual Box Test, Torrance's Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement (TCAM) task and the Toca Kitchen Monsters task. These tasks are designed for children aged above 12, 36 and 18 months respectively, but very few measures of creativity can be used for infants aged below 2. Accordingly, here we report age-appropriate adaptations of TCAM and Toca Kitchen Monsters tasks for infants as young as 12 to 24 months. Considerations taken into account include (1) infants’ cognitive capacities (i.e., attention span, language comprehension skills, motor skills, and approach to play), and (2) practicality of the stimuli, including suitability for use amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The modified creativity battery for infants includes three tasks: Music Play, Object Play and Exploratory Play tasks. The task protocols elaborated in this paper are intended to facilitate studies on the early development of creativity in infants aged between 12 and 24 months. Primary highlights include:•Age-appropriate adaptation of creativity tasks for use with infants aged between 12 and 24 months.•Consideration of infants’ cognitive capacities and stimulus practicality.•Innovative use of movement as expression of infants’ creative behaviour.

AB  - The ‘smart city’ is an oft-cited techno-urban imaginary promoted by businesses and governments alike. It thinks big, and is chiefly imagined in terms of large-scale information communications systems that hinge on the collection of real-time and so-called ‘big data’. Less talked about are the human-scale implications and user-experience of the smart city. Much of the current academic scholarship on smart cities offers synoptic and technical perspectives, leaving the users of smart systems curiously unaccounted for. While they purport to empower citizens, smart cities initiatives are rarely focused at the citizen-scale, nor do they necessarily attend to the ways initiatives can be user-led or co-designed. Drawing on the outcomes of a university studio, this article rethinks the smart city as a series of urban scales—metropolis, community, individual, and personal—and proposes an analytical model for classifying smart city initiatives in terms of engagement. Informed by the theory of proxemics, the model proposed analyses smart city initiatives in terms of the scope of their features and audience size; the actors accountable for their deployment and maintenance; their spatial reach; and the ability of design solutions to re-shape and adapt to different urban scenarios and precincts. We argue that the significance of this model lies in its potential to facilitate modes of thinking across and between scales in ways that can gauge the levels of involvement in the design of digitally mediated urban environments, and productively re-situate citizens as central to the design of smart city initiatives.

AB  - Understanding the molecular and physical complexity of the tissue microenvironment (TiME) in the context of its spatiotemporal organization has remained an enduring challenge. Recent advances in engineering and data science are now promising the ability to study the structure, functions, and dynamics of the TiME in unprecedented detail; however, many advances still occur in silos that rarely integrate information to study the TiME in its full detail. This review provides an integrative overview of the engineering principles underlying chemical, optical, electrical, mechanical, and computational science to probe, sense, model, and fabricate the TiME. In individual sections, we first summarize the underlying principles, capabilities, and scope of emerging technologies, the breakthrough discoveries enabled by each technology and recent, promising innovations. We provide perspectives on the potential of these advances in answering critical questions about the TiME and its role in various disease and developmental processes. Finally, we present an integrative view that appreciates the major scientific and educational aspects in the study of the TiME.

AB  - The research and moral use of academic technology focuses on developing, implementing, and overseeing the use of suitable technical resources and procedures to enhance learning and achievement. Multimedia has found its position in some form as an educational technology platform in the contemporary environment of academic universities. The use of virtual reality software as an intellectual tool and learning provider allows students to perform cognitive rehabilitation of preexisting information frameworks. People are paying more and more attention to how preschoolers' holistic skills develop as education reform progresses. Drama education is incorporated into the school curriculum to enhance young children's artistic, intellectual, and linguistic skills. Therefore, this study aims to examine the potential of multimedia-based virtual reality technology (MVRT) in drama education. The participants in this study were students from different universities in China. Students were exposed to multimedia-based virtual reality technology, and its efficacy was assessed using a statistical analytic approach called Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Drama understanding rate, educational improvement ratio, teaching quality rate, student achievement ratio, computation time, and parental support rate are among the performance metrics used to assess performance. Multimedia-based virtual reality technology (MVRT) for drama education showed outstanding success, with a 98% improvement ratio in educational outcomes and higher teaching quality. Students exhibited improved performance, supported by solid parental approval, demonstrating the effectiveness of MVRT in enhancing educational experiences.

AB  - Developing Scientific Reasoning (SR) competencies at an early age, are challenging to meet expectation of the 4th sustainable development goal. Hence, educators and educational decision-makers try to embed these competencies into such subjects as the arts, language, technology, economics, mathematics and science, using an inter-disciplinary approach. In this context, this paper proposes a fuzzy knowledge-based solution to build practical pupils, educators, and decision-makers recommender system to support the development of SR competencies in a data driver manner. Our system consists of:(1) inferring and computational module that calculates in a fuzzy manner the global appreciation to each SR-competencies. (2) recommendation module that aims to help learners, educators and decision makers to assess the degree of development of SR competencies and to get alternative suggestion of remediation. The proposed solution has been tested on the last two levels of science education in four Tunisian elementary schools in different regions. A preliminary analysis showed that the learning process should be more focused on Tunisian pupil's profile, and that investigation and collaborative based learning should be applied further in Tunisian classroom.

AB  - This position paper is an outcome of discussions that took place at the third FIPSE Symposium in Rhodes, Greece, between June 20–22, 2016 (http://fi-in-pse.org). The FIPSE objective is to discuss open research challenges in topics of Process Systems Engineering (PSE). Here, we discuss the societal and industrial context in which systems thinking and Process Systems Engineering provide indispensable skills and tools for generating innovative solutions to complex problems. We further highlight the present and future challenges that require systems approaches and tools to address not only ‘grand’ challenges but any complex socio-technical challenge. The current state of Process Systems Engineering (PSE) education in the area of chemical and biochemical engineering is considered. We discuss approaches and content at both the unit learning level and at the curriculum level that will enhance the graduates’ capabilities to meet the future challenges they will be facing. PSE principles are important in their own right, but importantly they provide significant opportunities to aid the integration of learning in the basic and engineering sciences across the whole curriculum. This fact is crucial in curriculum design and implementation, such that our graduates benefit to the maximum extent from their learning.

AB  - Beyond words and gestures, people have a remarkable capacity to communicate indirectly through everyday objects: A hat on a chair can mean it is occupied, rope hanging across an entrance can mean we should not cross, and objects placed in a closed box can imply they are not ours to take. How do people generate and interpret the communicative meaning of objects? We hypothesized that this capacity is supported by social goal inference, where observers recover what social goal explains an object being placed in a particular location. To test this idea, we study a category of common ad-hoc communicative objects where a small cost is used to signal avoidance. Using computational modeling, we first show that goal inference from indirect physical evidence can give rise to the ability to use object placement to communicate. We then show that people from the U.S. and the Tsimane’—a farming-foraging group native to the Bolivian Amazon—can infer the communicative meaning of object placement in the absence of a pre-existing convention, and that people’s inferences are quantitatively predicted by our model. Finally, we show evidence that people can store and retrieve this meaning for use in subsequent encounters, revealing a potential mechanism for how ad-hoc communicative objects become quickly conventionalized. Our model helps shed light on how humans use their ability to interpret other people’s behavior to embed social meaning into the physical world.

AB  - We show how to use the introductory econometrics textbook by Stock and Watson (2019) as a starting point for teaching and studying dynamic panel data methods. The materials are intended for undergraduate students taking their second econometrics course, undergraduate students in seminar-type courses, independent study courses, capstone, or thesis projects, and beginning graduate students in a research methods course. First, we distill the methodological core necessary to understand dynamic panel data methods. Second, we design an empirical and a theoretical case study to highlight the capabilities, downsides, and hazards of the method. The empirical case study is based on the cigarette demand example in Stock and Watson (2019) and illustrates that economic and methodological issues are interrelated. The theoretical case study shows how to evaluate current empirical practices from a theoretical standpoint. We designed both case studies to boost students’ confidence in working with technical material and to provide instructors with more opportunities to let students develop econometric thinking and to actively communicate with applied economists. Although we focus on Stock and Watson (2019) and the statistical software R, we also show how to modify the material for use with another introductory textbook by Wooldridge (2020) and Stata, and highlight some possible further pathways for instructors and students to reuse and extend our materials.

Its most significant feature is the first-class representation of concurrent executions as monadic expressions. We illustrate the representation techniques available within CLF by applying them to an asynchronous pi-calculus with correspondence assertions, including its dynamic semantics, safety criterion, and a type system with latent effects due to Gordon and Jeffrey.

AB  - In human and non-human animals, conceptual knowledge is partially organized according to low-dimensional geometries that rely on brain structures and computations involved in spatial representations. Recently, two separate lines of research have investigated cognitive maps, that are associated with the hippocampal formation and are similar to world-centered representations of the environment, and image spaces, that are associated with the parietal cortex and are similar to self-centered spatial relationships. We review evidence supporting cognitive maps and image spaces, and we propose a hippocampal–parietal network that can account for the organization and retrieval of knowledge across multiple reference frames. We also suggest that cognitive maps and image spaces may be two manifestations of a more general propensity of the mind to create low-dimensional internal models.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives
Previous studies of aneurysm flow dynamics based on three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (RA) images were limited to aneurysms with a single route of blood inflow. However, aneurysms of the circle of Willis frequently involve locations with more than one source of inflow, such as aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery. The highest resolution images of cerebral vessels are from RA images, but this technique is limited to visualizing only one route of inflow at a time, leaving a significant limitation in the application of 3DRA image sets for clinical studies of patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In this report, subject-specific models of cerebral aneurysms with multiple avenues of flow are constructed from RA images by using a novel combination of image coregistration and surface merging techniques.
Materials and Methods
RA images are obtained by means of contrast injection in each vessel that provides inflow to the aneurysm. Anatomic models are constructed independently of each of these vascular trees and fused together into a single model. The model is used to construct a finite element grid for CFD simulations of hemodynamics.
Results
Three examples of patient-specific models are presented: an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a basilar tip aneurysm, and a model of an entire circle of Willis with five coincident aneurysms. The method is evaluated with a numeric phantom of an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery.
Conclusion
These examples show that this new technique can be used to create merged network numeric models for CFD modeling. Furthermore, intra-aneurysmal flow patterns are influenced strongly by merging of the two inflow streams. This effect decreases as distance from the merging streams increases.

AB  - Modern advances in computational language processing methods have enabled new approaches to the measurement of mental processes. However, the field has primarily focused on model accuracy in predicting performance on a task or a diagnostic category. Instead the field should be more focused on determining which computational analyses align best with the targeted neurocognitive/psychological functions that we want to assess. In this paper we reflect on two decades of experience with the application of language-based assessment to patients' mental state and cognitive function by addressing the questions of what we are measuring, how it should be measured and why we are measuring the phenomena. We address the questions by advocating for a principled framework for aligning computational models to the constructs being assessed and the tasks being used, as well as defining how those constructs relate to patient clinical states. We further examine the assumptions that go into the computational models and the effects that model design decisions may have on the accuracy, bias and generalizability of models for assessing clinical states. Finally, we describe how this principled approach can further the goal of transitioning language-based computational assessments to part of clinical practice while gaining the trust of critical stakeholders.

How can these general techniques be augmented for supporting design exploration and creativity? This paper investigates these questions through a review of five different generative design techniques used in architectural design that includes cellular automata, genetic algorithms, L-systems, shape grammars, and swarm intelligence. Based on the literature on design cognition and the recent theoretical works on digital design thinking, this paper proposes the need for an integrated generative design framework to enhance design exploration support for human designers. Potential challenges and strategies towards developing such an integrated framework are discussed.

AB  - This chapter’s main aim is to interrogate how augmented reality (AR) content can change the relations of power within a place and transform the perception of place from being a material background for social interactions into a living agent that can have its own agency. We use the concept of sociotechnical imaginary and thematic analysis of AR-related media content to explore main narrations in the current discourse on AR and smart urban spaces. We identify two dominant themes: “smart information in place” and “subversion of meaning” that combine two ways of thinking about relation between place and AR. In the first one, AR acts not as an augmentation of place, but as a reducer of the experience of place down to seeing the world as information and data for the achievement of efficiencies in late capitalism. In the second one, AR can be seen as transcending the traditional constellations of power relations that shape places and spaces of modern cities, skewing them toward nonhuman actors, of which AR may be the most visible and influential. Through the visible differentiation of users, alteration of perception and the forcing of presence and behavior, AR is a technology that makes visible the systems and processes of control and mediation of space and place. As such, the smart space itself will become visible through the presence, use, and functioning of AR in a manner that has not been the case previously. We posit, therefore, that AR can be seen as a physical manifestation of the agency of place. This position can have consequences for the practical development of smart spaces and for theoretical consideration of the human-technology interaction in urban space in its material and digital dimensions.

AB  - This paper addresses some of the challenges involved in implementing the new approach established in the Spanish National Curriculum in 2006, which brought as a major change a focus on the development of key competencies. The paper focuses on scientific competency and the challenges involved in the itinerary from policy documents to classrooms are addressed in three sections: (i) an analysis is made of the changes in the science curriculum as a consequence of the emphasis on scientific competency, comparing the assessment criteria in the previous and current steering documents; (ii) trends in teacher education are discussed; (iii) the findings of the diagnostic evaluation are analyzed. The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students’ participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. It is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students’ prolonged engagement.

AB  - The production system and its maintenance system must be now developed on “system thinking” paradigm in order to guarantee that Key Performance Indicators (KPI) will be optimized all along the production system (operation) life. In a recursive way, maintenance system engineering has to integrate also KPI considerations with regards to its own enabling systems. Thus this paper develops a system-based methodology wherein a set of KPIs is computed in order to verify if the objectives of the production and maintenance systems are satisfied. In order to help the decision-making process for maintenance managers, a “unified” generic model have been developed. This model integrates (a) the interactions of the maintenance system with its enabling systems, (b) the impact of the maintenance strategies through the computation of some key performance indicators, and (c) different kinds of knowledge regarding the maintenance system and the system of interest, including quantitative and qualitative knowledge. This methodology is based on an executable unified model built with Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM). PRM allows a modular representation and inferences computation of large size models. The methodology added-value is shown on a test-bench.

AB  - In the field of energy system modelling, increasing complexity and optimization analysis are essential for understanding the most effective decarbonization options. However, the growing need for intricate models leads to increased computational time, which can hinder progress in research and policy-making. This study aims to address this issue by integrating machine learning algorithms with EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt, a coupling of EnergyPLAN software and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to expedite the optimization process while maintaining accuracy. By saving computational time, we can increase the number of evaluations, thereby enabling deeper exploration of uncertainty in energy system modelling. Although machine learning models have been widely employed as surrogate models to accelerate optimization problems, their application in energy system modeling at the national scale, while preserving high temporal resolution and extensive sector-coupling, remains scarce. Several machine learning models were evaluated, and an artificial neural network was selected as the most effective surrogate model. The findings demonstrate that incorporating this surrogate model within the optimization process reduces computational time by 64 % compared to the conventional EPLANopt approach, while maintaining an accuracy level close to that obtained by running EPLANopt without the surrogate model.

AB  - Forecasting economic choice is hard because today we still do not know enough about human motivation. A fundamental problem is the lack of knowledge about how the neural networks in the brain give rise to thinking and decision making. One way to address the issue has been to develop simplified economic experiments, in which participants need skills of little complexity and their minds employ cognitive mechanisms, already well understood by mathematical psychology and neuroscience. Here we take a neural model for rudimentary emotion generation and memorizing and use it as a guiding theory to understand decision making in an experimental oligopoly market. For the first time in that line of research, participants are put in a lab virtual social network serving to exchange opinions about deals with companies. On average, choices become significantly more predictable when people participate in the network, in contrast to working alone with expert information. Calibrating the model for each person, we find that some people are predicted with startling precision.

However, these problems can be extremely challenging due to the stringent time requirements, complex constraints, and a high number of design parameters. Solution methods tend to use conventional methods such as Lagrangian duality and fractional programming in combination with numerical solvers, while new trends tend to use evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence. This chapter provides a summary review of the bio-inspired optimization algorithms and their applications in telecommunications. We also discuss key issues in optimization and some active topics for further research.

AB  - Online forums afford individuals opportunities to take part in a community with shared interests and goals. This involves the sharing of experiences and advice (Attard and Coulson, 2012) and can lead to positive effects (Pendry and Salvatore, 2015). Online forums also afford access to rich sources of detailed data, personal experiences, and hard-to-reach or taboo communities. Such online research, though well-suited to qualitative analysis, leads to a number of practical problems in terms of range, depth, and ease of access to data. Even extensive data collection and manual analysis often only engage with a small percentage of the data available in online communities. In this article, we present a traditional manual collection and thematic analysis of data (2631 posts across 60 different threads, approximately 300,000 words) from forums where sex workers and men who pay for sex discuss matters relating to prostitution. This analysis revealed five themes of forum use: preference sharing, personal narrative sharing, practical advice, philosophical issues, and community maintenance. Further automated data collection and corpus analysis, such as keyness and topic modelling, are presented as a potential innovation within online qualitative research. This approach allowed for the analysis of a larger dataset of 255,891 posts, across 14,232 threads (16,472,006 words), revealing additional themes such as sexual hygiene, desire, legality, and ethnicity, as well as differences in the use of terms of address and slang by punters and sex workers. The automated methods presented allow for more comprehensive investigations of online communities than traditional approaches, but we also note that manual interpretation should still be incorporated into the analysis.

Selected noncovalent interactions have additionally been analysed by DFT and AIM techniques. No halogen bonding has been observed in these systems, but X lone pair···π, C–H···O=C and C–H···π interactions are the prevalent ones in the halogenated systems. Removal of the steric bulk in N‐(2,4,6‐trimethylphenyl)‐9,10‐iminophenanthrenequinone affords different noncovalent interactions, but the C–H···O=C hydrogen bonds are observed. Surprisingly, in N‐(2,6‐dimethylphenyl)‐9,10‐iminophenanthrenequinone and N‐(phenyl)‐9,10‐iminophenanthrenequinone these C–H···O=C hydrogen bonds are not observed. However, they are observed in the related 2,6‐di‐tert‐butylphenanthrene‐9,10‐dione. The π‐interactions in dimers extracted from the crystal structures have been analysed by DFT and AIM. Spectroscopic investigations are also presented and these show only small perturbations to the O=C–C=N fragment.

AB  - Standard economic theory uses mathematics as its main means of understanding, and this brings clarity of reasoning and logical power. But there is a drawback: algebraic mathematics restricts economic modeling to what can be expressed only in quantitative nouns, and this forces theory to leave out matters to do with process, formation, adjustment, and creation—matters to do with nonequilibrium. For these we need a different means of understanding, one that allows verbs as well as nouns. Algorithmic expression is such a means. It allows verbs—processes—as well as nouns—objects and quantities. It allows fuller description in economics, and can include heterogeneity of agents, actions as well as objects, and realistic models of behavior in ill-defined situations. The world that algorithms reveal is action-based as well as object-based, organic, possibly ever-changing, and not fully knowable. But it is strangely and wonderfully alive.

AB  - Mathematics teachers are called on to craft instruction that centers students’ mathematical ideas and creates consistent, pervasive opportunities for meaning-making through discourse. In the context of collaborative problem solving, teachers can use eliciting and probing to uncover student thinking while students work together to develop mathematical ideas and strategies. After eliciting and probing, teachers can further respond to the student thinking that has been revealed. This study explored the discursive pathways two fourth grade mathematics teachers used after eliciting student thinking, when their aim was to be responsive to and advance student thinking. Drawing on interactions (n = 97) from nine lessons, qualitative analysis identified five distinct discursive pathways after eliciting, two of which, praise and funneling, were associated with the nature of student understanding uncovered during eliciting. Implications for future research and professional development on teacher-student discourse are discussed.

AB  - Background
There has been an increase of autistic students without intellectual disabilities (autisticWoID) placed in general education settings (Hussar et al., 2020), but there is a lack of understanding of how to best support classroom learning for these children. Previous research has pointed to subgroups of autisticWoID children who display difficulty with mathematics and reading achievement (Chen et al., 2018; Estes et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2015). Research has primarily focused on symptomatology and communication factors related to learning in subgroups of autistic children. The current study sought to expand upon this research by assessing the validity of these previous studies and by investigating the specific contribution of domain-general cognitive abilities to differences in these subgroups.
Method
Seventy-eight autisticWoID individuals (M = 11.34 years, SD = 2.14) completed measures of mathematics and reading achievement, IQ, working memory, inferential thinking, and Theory of Mind (ToM). A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the math and reading measures.
Results
The analysis revealed two unique achievement groups: one group that performed lower than expected on math and reading achievement and a second group that performed higher than expected. Groups differed significantly on IQ and working memory and were distinguished by performance on reading fluency. Groups did not differ on ToM, inferential thinking, or symptomatology.
Conclusion
These findings describe a group of autisticWoID individuals that may be more likely to experience difficulty learning, which should be accounted for in general education settings.

AB  - Complexity has radically changed human understanding of the world environment and continues challenging our best scientific theories. In a rapidly changing research landscape, historical and philosophical insights into Complexity can heighten awareness of the proper theoretical perspectives scientists should adopt to advance the study of biocomplexity, including ecological complexity. The present work aims to deepen this awareness and disclose how researchers should generally approach, scientifically and philosophically, the question of what Complexity is, which is of great importance not only to the scientific community but also far beyond. First, this article reviews some critical historical turning points that led to Complexity. Second, the paper discusses philosophical-scientific approaches to the emergence as one of the most critical features of complex systems. The critical ideas behind attempts to understand the generators of complexity in nature are then presented, focusing on the living world. Finally, the review focuses on understanding the ecosystem- and organism-oriented perspectives of biocomplexity. We conclude that the genuine problem of the origin of complexity theory and biocomplexity will continue to inspire generations of researchers to search for new, more comprehensive mathematical and computational frameworks to explain biological hierarchies in order to further advance the scientific understanding of life.

AB  - Given that modern children have grown up with numerous digital interactive devices it is essential to understand how the digital environment might affect children's cognitive development. As an extension of previous studies, this research investigates the cognitive effects of tactile interaction on children's problem solving. In order to explore the cognitive development of children with respect to tactile interaction, we compared furniture arrangements by elementary school students of 3D blocks and pencils. A protocol analysis was adopted for examining the ways in which children used the two different tools. The results of this study show that tactile interaction supports children's problem solving. This research implies that children in early education need to experience a wide range of digital devices utilizing rich sensorial dimensions as such devices stimulate divergent thinking, affecting cognitive developmental trajectories.

AB  - In this paper we present an algorithm for the integer linear programming (ILP) problem within an algebraic model of computation and use it to solve the following digital plane segment recognition problem: Given a set of points M={p1,p2,…,pm}⊆Rn, decide whether M is a portion of a digital hyperplane and, if so, determine its analytical representation. In our setting p1, p2, …,pm may be arbitrary points (possibly, with rational and/or irrational coefficients) and the dimension n may be any arbitrary fixed integer. We reduce this last problem to an ILP to which our general integer programming algorithm applies. It performs O(mlogD) arithmetic operations, where D is a bound on the norm of the domain elements. For the special case of problem dimension two, we propose an elementary algorithm that takes advantage of the specific geometry of the problem and appears to be optimal. It implies an efficient algorithm for digital line segment recognition.

AB  - The growing interest in the role of social support in mental and physical health has led to the development of several intelligent systems that aim to use social mechanisms to simulate healthy behaviour. In this paper a computational model of a human agent is presented which describes the effect of social support on mood. According to the literature, social support can either refer to the social resources that individuals perceive to be available or to the support that is actually provided in problematic situations. The proposed model distinguishes between both roles of social support. The role of social network characteristics has been taken into account, as an individual can perceive or receive social support through his/her social network. In addition, the number of connections (friends), strength of ties (relationships), social isolation and social integration have been studied. Simulation experiments have been done to analyze the effect of the different types of support in different scenarios and also to analyze the role of various social network characteristics on the mood level. It is shown that support can help to reduce the induced stress and thus can contribute to healthy mood regulation and prevention of depression. The presented model provides a basis for an intelligent support system for people with mood regulation problems that take the social network of people into account.

AB  - Significant efforts have been devoted to assessing construction and demolition waste management (CDWM). However, there is little knowledge to understand the utilisation of the developed models for assessing CDWM performance, thus limiting the comparison and generalization of recognized methods and tools. By reviewing the prior published literature, this study assesses the current research methods, in particular, data collection. It also reviews the range of critical indicators for CDWM performance assessment considered by the literature and put forwards a new framework for better assessing CDWM performance. The proposed framework summarises the system boundary, research scale and performance assessment aspects documented by previous studies, and further integrate an integrated framework with procedures for better assessing CDWM performance. The literature review found that while some studies adopt a system thinking and life cycle thinking to assess CDWM performance, other research they adopt a sustainability based model to finalize CDWM performance assessment. The results also demonstrate that compared with environmental and economic aspects, the social aspect has attracted less attention. Social factors, however are crucial in CDWM. The findings about current performance assessment practices in CDWM and the proposed procedures are possible to implement for researchers and practitioners to develop sound CDWM approaches.

AB  - The behaviour of a simple single-bolted-joint under tensile separating loads is analysed using conventional analytical methods, a finite element approach and experimental techniques. The variation in bolt force with external load predicted by the finite element analysis conforms well to the experimental results. It is demonstrated that certain detailed features such as thread interaction do not need to be modelled to ensure useful results. Behaviour during the pre-loading phase of use agrees with previous long-standing studies. However, the pre-loading analysis does not carry over to the stage when external loading is applied, as is normally assumed and it is shown that the current, conventional analytical methods substantially over-predict the proportion of the external load carried by the bolt. The basic reason for this is shown to be related to the non-linear variation in contact conditions between the clamped members during the external loading stage.

AB  - Peptides, biopolymeric compounds connected by peptide bonds, have garnered significant attention in recent years as their potential wide applications in fields such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and antibiotics. Peptides exhibit excellent biocompatibility and stability due to their structural similarities to many bioactive substances found in human bodies. The self-assembly of peptides has piqued considerable interest with groundbreaking advancements achieved in experimental research. However, it is still a big challenge to establish comprehensive theoretical model to accurately describe the behavior of peptide self-assembly. Current peptide self-assembly designs primarily rely on experimental outcomes and general rules, which is inefficient and susceptible to human errors. In recent years, thanks to rapid advancements in computer techniques and theoretical methods, computational research has become a vital tool in complementing experimental research with rapid development witted in this field. This review delves into the description of peptide self-assembly, covering relevant sequences, structures, morphologies, rules, and application areas. It places particular emphasis on the recent progress in computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML) techniques in the study. Finally, we provide a perspective on the application of computational methods to expedite exploration in the realm of multi-peptide self-assembly.

We assemble these new developments under the label of the morphological paradigm. The change in its paradigms and the development of alternatives to the principles that dominated robotics for a long time contains a more general epistemological significance. The role of body, material, environment, interaction and the paradigmatic status of biological and evolutionary systems for the principles of control are crucial here. Our focus will be on the introduction of the morphological paradigm in a new type of robotics and to contrast the interests behind this development with the interests shaping former models. The article aims to give a clear account of the changes in principles of orientation and control as well as concluding general observation in terms of historical epistemology, suggesting further political-epistemological analysis.

AB  - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping enable a mobile robot that is exploring an uncharted environment to localize itself and calculate its path within the map. In the context of green technologies and applications, there is a growing need for efficient SLAM solutions that not only provide accurate localization and mapping but also minimize power consumption. EKF-SLAM is a SLAM solution based on the Extended Kalman Filter, it is well known In the domain of robotics for its ability to handle non-linear models, its ability to handle noise related to the sensors, and its extremely high degree of precision. To guarantee real-time performance, the EKF-SLAM implementation requires a high-performance hardware architecture. In light of this challenge, researchers are thinking about using parallel processing platforms like FPGAs, which can provide the required level of performance and meet strict constraints on physics, computing capacity, and electrical power. This study describes a hardware architecture's implementation design for EKF-SLAM on an FPGA platform. The entire design is built on the Cyclone 2 FPGA, which has a maximum speed of 114 MHz and 18577 LUTs, creating a highly efficient hardware architecture.

Overall perceived pleasantness did not differ between tasks. However, results indicate that the perceived pleasantness of the story writing task increased during task completion whereas the perceived pleasantness of divergent thinking tasks remained stable during task performance. The number of generated ideas in a divergent thinking task (fluency) was significantly related to overall perceived pleasantness of the task.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient and reliable evolutionary based approach to solve the economic load dispatch (ELD) with security constraints. A new approach is proposed which employs attractive and repulsive particle swarm optimization (ARPSO) algorithm for ELD. Incorporation of ARPSO as a derivative-free optimization technique in solving ELD with security (voltages and line-flows) constraints significantly relieves the assumptions imposed on the optimized objective function. The proposed approach has been implemented on three representative systems, i.e. IEEE 14 bus, IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 57 bus systems, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated and the results are compared with linear programming, quadratic programming and genetic algorithm, respectively. The premature convergence problem, that is common in all evolutionary computation techniques, is solved in ARPSO by including the diversity factor in the Type 1 PSO algorithm. The developed algorithms are computationally faster (in terms of the number of load flows carried out) than the other methods because only one run is required.

AB  - Past research has independently examined the concepts of certainty and future thought. Here we combine these concepts by examining the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of certainty about the future during periods of societal uncertainty. Three studies (N = 1218) examined future certainty, defined as feeling certain about some future event or outcome, during two major societal events of uncertainty—the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In Study 1, certainty about positive or negative futures of COVID-19 (e.g., the pandemic will end soon; the pandemic will never end) predicted poorer information seeking—ignorance of medical experts, adherence to conspiratorial thinking, and lower objective knowledgeability about COVID-19. Building on these findings, in Study 2, future certainty predicted antisocial health behaviors, including failing to social distance. Study 3 extended these findings to the political domain—the 2020 Presidential Election. Future certainty that one's preferred candidate would win the election predicted poor information seeking and antisocial behaviors in terms of claiming that the election was rigged, endorsing violence if one's candidate lost, and, among Trump supporters, identifying with Capitol insurrectionists. These findings suggest that future certainty is linked to intellectual blindness and antisocial behaviors during important periods of societal uncertainty.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed the importance of cognitive abilities in creative thinking. However, most research addressed adults and only a few studies have examined the ways these correlations are manifested among young children. The present study explores the role of various cognitive abilities in creativity among school children. Measures of creativity, visual-spatial working memory (VSWM), verbal short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and visual processing (VP) were administered to 331 students in Grades 4 and 5. Cluster analysis was used to group students' creativity levels. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to test differences in cognitive abilities across the three clusters. Group differences between high and moderate level creativity students and low creativity students were found regarding VP abilities in the following tests: VSWM, visual discrimination (VD), and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Group differences between high creativity students and low creativity students were also found on verbal STM and WM. Additionally, structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that VP can significantly account for unique variances associated with creativity, while verbal STM and WM are not significantly related to creativity. These findings enlighten the cognitive processes underlying creativity in young children.

AB  - Copeland and others have argued that the Church–Turing thesis (CTT) has been widely misunderstood by philosophers and cognitive scientists. In particular, they have claimed that CTT is in principle compatible with the existence of machines that compute functions above the “Turing limit,” and that empirical investigation is needed to determine the “exact membership” of the set of functions that are physically computable. I argue for the following points: (a) It is highly doubtful that philosophers and cognitive scientists have widely misunderstood CTT as alleged.1 In fact, by and large, computability theorists and mathematical logicians understand CTT in the exact same way. (b) That understanding most likely coincides with what Turing and Church had in mind. Even if it does not, an accurate exegesis of Turing and Church need not dictate how today's working scientists understand the thesis. (c) Even if we grant Copeland's reading of CTT, an orthodox stronger version of it which he rejects (Gandy's thesis) follows readily if we only accept a highly plausible necessary condition for what constitutes a deterministic digital computer. Finally, (d) regardless of whether we accept this condition, the prospects for a scientific theory of hypercomputation are exceedingly poor because physical science does not have the wherewithal to investigate computability or to discover its ultimate “limit.”

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses how different types of entities such as individual objects, sets of objects, and ensembles can function as items to be maintained in working memory (WM). All of these types of representations can be relevant to thinking about quantities, and each supports different kinds of quantity-relevant computations. One way to overcome the three- to four-item limit of WM is to bind together representations of individual objects into representations of sets of objects. Binding multiple individuals into a single higher-order group can increase the number of individual items that can be remembered, as in the well-known demonstrations of chunking by adults. Set representations play a critical role in many numerical processes, including representing the nested relationships between as well as representing the cardinality of an array. Many real-world scenes contain stimuli that do not lend themselves to representation qua individual objects or sets of objects. One can imagine enumerating a flock containing dozens of individual birds.

AB  - The cutting pattern plays a major role for the design of structural membranes, since it influences both their aesthetical appearance and structural behavior. A novel approach towards cutting pattern generation is the so-called Variation of Reference Strategy (VaReS) [1], which minimizes the total potential energy arising from the motion of a planar cutting pattern to its corresponding three-dimensional shape. With non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) being the standard tool for geometry description in CAD, it is only consequent to use these for analysis as well. Isogeometric B-Rep Analysis (IBRA) [2] follows up on this idea and enriches the original Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which was introduced by Hughes et al. [3], by the possibility of analysing trimmed NURBS geometries. This paper presents cutting pattern generation with the Variation of Reference Strategy in the context of IGA/IBRA. With this approach, the whole design of a membrane structure can be represented by NURBS geometries – including blueprint plans. To use the benefits of IBRA for cutting pattern generation, a NURBS-based membrane-element was developed for the VaReS routine. A developable surface serves as a benchmark example, since its analytical cutting pattern is known. Examples of double-curved geometries show the applicability and benefits of the proposed procedure for real structures.

AB  - The present work is undertaken to investigate the molecular interaction between Memantine (Alzheimer's drug) and DL-Alanine (amino acid) using DFT and vibrational spectroscopic methods, in particular, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman techniques. The DFT calculations of these molecules are carried out using the B3LYP/6–311 ++ G (d, p) level of theory. The experimental FTIR and Raman spectra of the molecules are compared to the respective DFT computed wavenumbers. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between experimental and computed wavenumbers. Further, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, total energy, zero-point vibrational energy, Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP), chemical potential, hardness, ionization energy, global electrophilicity index, dipole moments, and first-order hyperpolarizabilities of the interacting state are reported and compared to the respective parameters of the individual states. The NBO analysis of the molecules indicates the transfer of charge between DL-Alanine and Memantine through NH•••O intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The molecular docking studies of the molecules are  performed to investigate the binding affinity of the ligand with the 6DG7 receptor.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms finds more and more its way into complex distributed systems. For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project “Very efficient deep learning in the IoT” (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.

AB  - In this paper we propose the use of neural interference as the origin of quantum-like effects in the brain. We do so by using a neural oscillator model consistent with neurophysiological data. The model used was shown elsewhere to reproduce well the predictions of behavioral stimulus-response theory. The quantum-like effects are brought about by the spreading activation of incompatible oscillators, leading to an interference-like effect mediated by inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

AB  - Despite the growing number of digital apps designed to teach coding skills to young children, we know little about their effectiveness. To formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (N = 28, Mage = 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.

Specifically, we detail how the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique (and its magnetic counterpart) can aid in development of models of visual word recognition. Any viable and accurate account of reading must take into account the temporal and anatomical constraints imposed by the fact that reading is a human brain function. We believe that neurophysiological (especially, although not limited to electrophysiological) data can serve an essential reference in the development of biologically realistic models of reading. We assess just how well extant electrophysiological data comport with specific predictions of existing computational models and offer some suggestions for the kinds of research that can address some of the remaining open questions.

AB  - Neuroscientists are searching for the engram within the conceptual framework established by John Locke's theory of mind. This framework was elaborated before the development of information theory, before the development of information processing machines and the science of computation, before the discovery that molecules carry hereditary information, before the discovery of the codon code and the molecular machinery for editing the messages written in this code and translating it into transcription factors that mark abstract features of organic structure such as anterior and distal. The search for the engram needs to abandon Locke's conceptual framework and work within a framework informed by these developments. The engram is the medium by which information extracted from past experience is transmitted to the computations that inform future behavior. The information-conveying symbols in the engram are rapidly generated in the course of computations, which implies that they are molecules.

AB  - Assembly of normally soluble proteins into amyloid fibrils is a cause or associated symptom of numerous human disorders. Although some progress toward understanding the molecular‐level details of fibril structure has been made through in vitro experiments, the insoluble nature of fibrils make them difficult to study experimentally. We describe two computational approaches used to investigate fibril formation and structure: intermediate‐resolution discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, but taken together the two approaches provide a useful molecular‐level picture of fibril structure and formation.

AB  - Analysing the processes and products of creativity to better understand and support individuals and teams, is a difficult and elusive challenge despite years of research in creativity. In this article, we are particularly interested in social creativity in communities of interest. Building on Guilford's classic model of Divergent Thinking of fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration, we employ Social Network Analysis to model the creative design process. The creative process in the current study takes place in a technological environment called the ‘MC-squared platform’, in which members of a community of interest collaborate in a social, co-creative process for designing digital, mathematical textbooks. Both the technological environment and the methodology are exemplified through two case examples, one on the design process of a digital book about a bioclimatic amusement park and one on the design process of a digital book about fractions. We conclude that, for these examples, both the technological tool and the data analysis approach provide insight into the social creativity process of the community of interest.

Novel computational methods such as artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and genetic programming are used in this chapter for the modeling of the nonlinear behavior of composite laminates subjected to constant amplitude loading. The examined computational methods are stochastic nonlinear regression tools, and can therefore be used to model the fatigue behavior of any material, provided that sufficient data are available for training. They are material-independent methods that simply follow the trend of the available data, in each case giving the best estimate of their behavior. Application on a wide range of experimental data gathered after fatigue testing glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates proved that their modeling ability compares favorably with, and is to some extent superior to, other modeling techniques.

AB  - The design-build studio (DBS) is an emergent paradigm in architecture education. Recently, researchers have addressed the success of integrating the design-build concept into the conventional studio in the advanced years of education to improve several issues related to the design process: social, environmental, technological, …etc. However, its efficiency in terms of contribution to the learning experience has not yet been addressed. This paper examines the implementation of the DBS concept as a new teaching model to improve the problem-solving skills (PSS) of first-year students in engineering education. It also discusses the effectson learning experiences and pedagogical outcomes in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The research’s results identify the significance of applying this model as a real-simulated method-based learning experience. It can help students to improve their learning experiences and to enhance students self-confidence regarding PSS.

AB  - Successful materials innovations can transform society. However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stakeholders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake.

The details include breaking down the ICOM implementation in the form of the mASI system and the general performance of initial studies with the mASI. Details of the primary difference between the Independent Core Observer Model Cognitive Architecture and the mASI architecture variant include inserting humanity in the contextual engine components of ICOM, creating a type of collective intelligence. Humans can ‘mediate’ new system-generated thinking keeping the thought process accessible and slow enough for humans to oversee and understand. This also allows the modification of emotional valences of the thought process of the mASI system to help the system generate complex contextual models (knowledge graphs) of new ideas and which speeds up the learning process. With the humans acting as control rods in a reactor and emotional drivers, the mASI system maintains safety where the system would cease to function if humans walked away.

AB  - Bone is probably the most frequently investigated biological material and finite element analysis (FEA) is the computational tool most commonly used for the analysis of bone biomechanical function. FEA has been used in bone research for more than 30years and has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the complex behavior of bone. Bone is structured in a hierarchical way covering many length scales and this chapter reflects this hierarchical organization. In particular, the focus is on the applications of FEA for understanding the relationship between bone structure and its mechanical function at specific hierarchical levels. Depending on the hierarchical level, different issues have been investigated with FEA ranging from more clinically oriented topics related to bone quality (e.g., predicting bone strength and fracture risk) to more fundamental problems dealing with the mechanical aspects of biological processes (e.g., stress and strain around osteocyte lacunae) as well as with the micromechanical behavior of bone at its ultrastructure. A better understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical function is expected to be important for the current trends in (bio)materials design, where the structure of biological materials is considered as a possible source of inspiration, as well as for more successful approaches in the prevention and treatment of age- and disease-related fractures.
