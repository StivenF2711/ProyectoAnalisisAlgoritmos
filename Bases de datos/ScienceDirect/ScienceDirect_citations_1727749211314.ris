AB  - In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.

AB  - Neural circuits have evolved to accommodate similar information processing challenges as those faced by engineered systems. Here, we compare neural versus engineering strategies for constructing networks. During circuit development, synapses are overproduced and then pruned back over time, whereas in engineered networks, connections are initially sparse and are then added over time. We provide a computational perspective on these two different approaches, including discussion of how and why they are used, insights that one can provide the other, and areas for future joint investigation. By thinking algorithmically about the goals, constraints, and optimization principles used by neural circuits, we can develop brain-derived strategies for enhancing network design, while also stimulating experimental hypotheses about circuit development and function.

AB  - Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization (CCSAV) is a technical methodology that offers support for online collective deliberation over complex dilemmas. As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wikis and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content.

AB  - As computational biology matures as a field, increasing attention is being paid to the relation of computational models to their target. One aspect of this is addressing how computational models can appropriately reproduce the variation seen in experimental data, with one solution being to use populations of models united by a common set of equations (the framework), with each individual member of the population (each model) possessing its own unique set of equation parameters. These model populations are then calibrated and validated against experimental data, and as a whole reproduce the experimentally observed variation. The primary focus of validation thus becomes the population, with the individual models' validation seemingly deriving from their membership of this population. The role of individual models within the population is not clear, with uncertainty regarding the relationship between individual models and the population they make up. This work examines the role of models within the population, how they relate to the population they make up, and how both can be said to be validated in this context.

AB  - Sustainable operations of energy production systems have become an increasingly important policy agenda globally because of the massive pressure placed on energy resources needed to support economic development and population growth. Due to the increasing research interest in examining the operational impacts of energy production systems on the society and the environment, this paper critically reviews the academic literature on the clean, affordable and secure supply of energy focussing on methods of assessments, measures of sustainability and emerging issues in the literature. While there have been some surveys on the sustainability of energy production systems they have either tended to focus on one assessment approach or one type of energy generation technology. This study builds on previous studies by providing a broader and comprehensive examination of the literature across generation technologies and assessment methods. A systematic review of 128 scholarly articles covering a 20-year period, ending 2018, and gathered from ProQuest, Scopus, and manual search is conducted. Synthesis and critical evaluation of the reviewed papers highlight a number of research gaps that exist within the sustainable energy production systems research domain. In addition, using mapping and cluster analyses, the paper visually highlights the network of dominant research issues, which emerged from the review.

AB  - Essentialist lay-theories can reflect a belief in genetic, social, and metaphysical determinism. These three types of essentialist beliefs are similar as they can be linked to a set of motives and each of those beliefs is related to stereotyping and prejudice. Nevertheless, the available evidence indicates that the three types of essentialist thinking are largely unrelated and it is unclear why some individuals endorse one type of essentialism and reject another. Examining the association between the endorsement of essentialist beliefs and personal values, our results based on N = 348 respondents indicate that specific value profiles build the motivational basis for specific essentialist beliefs. Specifically, conservation values are associated with belief in genetic and metaphysical determinism, while self-transcendence and self-enhancement are associated with belief in social determinism.

AB  - There are two related measures of sea level, the absolute sea level, which is the increase in the sea level in an absolute reference frame, and relative sea level, which is the increase in sea level recorded by tide gauges. The first measure is a rather abstract computation, far from being reliable, and is preferred by activists and politicians for no scientific reason. For local and global problems it is better to use local tide gauge data. Proper coastal management should be based on proved measurements of sea level. Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating. We also show as the additional information provided by GPS and satellite altimetry is of very little help. Computations of “absolute” sea levels suffer from inaccuracies with errors larger than the estimated trends. The GPS is more reliable than satellite altimetry, but the accuracy of the estimation of the vertical velocity at GPS domes is still well above ±1 mm/year and the relative motion of tide gauges vs. GPS domes is mostly unassessed. The satellite altimetry returns a noisy signal so that a +3.2 mm/year trend is only achieved by arbitrary “corrections”. We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios. Ocean and coastal management should acknowledge all these facts. As the relative rates of rises are stable worldwide, coastal protection should be introduced only where the rate of rise of sea levels as determined from historical data show a tangible short term threat. As the first signs the sea levels will rise catastrophically within few years are nowhere to be seen, people should start really thinking about the warnings not to demolish everything for a case nobody knows will indeed happen.

AB  - This paper proposes a new conceptual design tool for bioenergy systems, the 2MBio, and its implementation on the case of wood fuel energy systems (WES) in South Mozambique. Dependence on wood fuel characterises most Sub-Saharan countries and WES are complex socio-ecological systems dynamically linked to crucial development issues, e.g., deforestation and poverty. In Mozambique WES supply over 70% of the national energy needs through an informal business network worth around one million euros each year. In contrast with the 2MBio, currently available tools often aim at supporting decision-making on WES with off-the-shelf expert solutions and optimisation of WES efficiency, supply chains and resource management. While relevant and useful, such approaches are frequently unsuitable to engage the knowledge and creativity of a wide range of crucial actors. The 2MBio addresses this gap providing a simple, visual platform on paper that supports from illiterate to professional users, to stimulate creative ideas and apply current knowledge while designing their own WES. The results of implementation in real settings in South Mozambique produced relevant design breakthroughs. Compared with the absence of any other support tool, and faced with same design challenges, the 2MBio participatory design workshops in south Mozambique resulted in comprehensive analysis of wood fuel energy systems, and innovative integrated WES solutions design. The proposed approach raised participants’ awareness about opportunities and constrains linked to their WES while also facilitating information sharing new learning dynamics and enhance creativity.

AB  - New and established ventures are under increasing pressure to consider how their current actions impact our future world. Whilst many practitioners are paying greater attention to their future impact, most impact assessment research focuses on the retrospective measurement of impact. Limited studies have explored how impact assessment is used as a tool to forecast or predict the intended impact of organisational action. This study aims to overcome this gap by exploring forward-looking approaches to impact assessment. An interdisciplinary systematic review of the impact assessment literature was conducted to answer the question: “How and why do organisations utilise forward-looking, future-oriented approaches to impact assessment?“. The findings elaborate on the common research themes, challenges, and gaps in understanding forward-looking impact assessment. An integrated process model is developed to show the relationships between various antecedents, methods, and effects of forward-looking impact assessment. Based on the review, the paper puts forward a research agenda to provoke further inquiry on forward-looking, future-oriented approaches to impact assessments related to four research themes: uncertainty, values and assumptions, stakeholder cooperation, and learning. The study contributes to the impact assessment literature by providing an overview of how the current literature comprehends forward-looking approaches and insights into how a more holistic view of temporality in impact assessment can be developed.

AB  - Students starting their tertiary studies in Informatics are found to have a low level of algorithmic skills and understanding of programming, which leads to the high number of drop out students and failed semesters during their studies. The students’ low level of programming skills contrasts with their excellent results in the school leaving exams. To find out the reasons for this we have launched the TAaAS project (Testing Algorithmic and Application Skills), which focuses on the students’ algorithmic skills and programming ability in traditional and non-traditional programming environments. Our analyses proved that school leaving exams are not able to measure these abilities of the students, and beyond that, are not able to distinguish between the different levels of the students. Students are accepted into the universities and start their studies based on the misleading results of the school leaving exams.

In this article, we examine the computations used to predict and avoid such events and to update our models of the world and action policies after their occurrence. We also consider how these computations might go wrong in anxiety disorders and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We review evidence that anxiety is linked to increased simulations of the future occurrence of high cost negative events and to elevated estimates of the probability of occurrence of such events. We also review psychological theories of PTSD in the light of newer, computational models of updating through replay and simulation. We consider whether pathological levels of re-experiencing symptomatology might reflect problems reconciling the traumatic outcome with overly optimistic priors or difficulties terminating off-line simulation focused on negative events and over-generalization to states sharing features with those antecedent to the trauma.

The subscriber can be thought of as a person or a group of users using a network service or connectivity. The DPI features represent the subscriber network usage, and the ensemble learning approach is implemented on the DPI dataset to predict the subscriber's service category on the network. The classification and prediction problem addressed on the DPI dataset reached a precision of 100%. The paper predicts that the web and streaming categories with Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube services will be the most utilized in the next few years. This study will lead to a better understanding of the idiosyncratic behavior of active subscribers on the network, exposing novel network anomalies and facilitating the development of novel DPI systems.

AB  - Although the traits emerged in a mass gathering are often non-deliberative, the act of mass impulse may lead to irrevocable crowd disasters. The two-fold increase of carnage in crowd since the past two decades has spurred significant advances in the field of computer vision, towards effective and proactive crowd surveillance. Computer vision studies related to crowd are observed to resonate with the understanding of the emergent behavior in physics (complex systems) and biology (animal swarm). These studies, which are inspired by biology and physics, share surprisingly common insights, and interesting contradictions. However, this aspect of discussion has not been fully explored. Therefore, this survey provides the readers with a review of the state-of-the-art methods in crowd behavior analysis from the physics and biologically inspired perspectives. We provide insights and comprehensive discussions for a broader understanding of the underlying prospect of blending physics and biology studies in computer vision.

AB  - The escort replicator dynamic (ERD) is a version of the replicator dynamic in evolutionary games where the utility-driven decision-making process is modulated due to the information costs to be paid by players. The escort function as a coefficient to distort the decision-making determines the behavior of solutions to the ERD, whereas its investigations are still not sufficient. Particularly, the ERD was investigated in finite-action settings in the previous studies, while that with a continuum of actions has not been studied well. In this paper, we formulate and analyze the ERD with a continuum of actions represented by a bounded interval. Our ERD is a partial integro-differential equation whose well-posedness is nontrivial because of specific nonlocal terms arising from the escort function. The Kaniadakis escort function is chosen as a major example of the escort function, with which we obtain the unique existence of solutions to the ERD. We also discuss cases with the other escort functions, such as the power and constant ones, and suggest that the growth and regularity behaviors of the escort function are crucial. Finally, we computationally apply the ERD to problems related to sustainable environmental and resource management.

The 13C NMR spectra and electron densities for the disulfonyl, nitro, and cyano carbon acids were calculated at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory. The calculated chemical shifts for disulfonyl carbanions show satisfying correlation with our own experimental data. The calculated π electron densities at the Cα atom correspond roughly to the “experimental” π electron densities estimated from the 13C chemical shifts. The natural charges at Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions are significantly more negative than with other types of carbanions, partly because of the significant negative natural charge of the α carbon in parent carbon acids. The calculated increase of the negative charge caused by ionization is larger for sulfonyl carbon acids than for cyano- and nitroalkanes. The 13C chemical shifts δ of Cα in disulfonyl stabilized carbanions decrease with more negative calculated negative natural charge at Cα, with a slope of 220ppm/electron. The influence of phenyl ring para-substitution on the charge distribution in carbanions and relationship between the 13C chemical shifts and charge density have been discussed. It appears that the π electron density in these planar or nearly planar carbanions has a decisive impact on the chemical shifts.

AB  - Antarctica is the southernmost continent of our planet, and it has been verified as the coldest region on earth. The Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) has as its main objective the promotion of high-quality scientific research in the Antarctic region, seeking to understand the events that occur there. PROANTAR, coordinated by the Navy Commander, has some sectors that are based in Brazil and others that are located in the Antarctic continent. The military that volunteers to occupy any vacancy that is allocated to that continent needs, besides passing through several pre-established criteria, to pass the selection process. The purpose of this article is to help the Naval Administration in the selection of volunteer officers to occupy a vacancy in the Antarctic continent. To obtain the alternatives, the officers that best fit the established vacancy, and the criteria to be evaluated, Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) was applied. Next, with all the necessary data, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method was used as a Multicriteria Decision Support (MDS) technique, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method, the CRITIC Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the criteria weights and the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method, with three normalizations, to order the alternatives. At the end of the application of the methods, the article can generate five ordinations of the volunteer officers to occupy the vacancy offered in PROANTAR.

AB  - There has been a growing attention on accessibility concepts from both planning practice and research recognising their relevance in understanding the evolution of urban areas. However, despite the large number of accessibility measures available in the literature, they are not widely used to support urban planning practices. Much has been said about the implementation gap of Planning Support Systems with a significant attention paid to usability and more recently to the usefulness of Accessibility Instruments. The paper aims to assess the usefulness of a specific accessibility instrument – the Structural Accessibility Layer (SAL) – and by doing so exploring the strengths of accessibility instruments holding similar characteristics. To this end, we follow a multidimensional assessment framework under development in the Planning Support System literature. This paper explores the main findings of a workshop bringing together local planning practitioners and the developers of the SAL in an experiment using the SAL. The assessment of usefulness of SAL identified the instrument’s strengths with regard to insight into participants’ assumptions, communication, commitment and development of shared language. Regardless, the low fit between planning concerns of participants (in this case study context) and of the SAL seemed to limit its potential use in practice and as such undermines the strengths identified in the usefulness assessment. The assessment developed here only partially confirmed objectives and purposes defined for the SAL. Results confirm the usefulness of the SAL as diagnosis tool, however, the ability of the SAL to contribute to a joint thinking of land use and transport constraints on mobility was not confirmed. Finally, this research raises questions on the role of PSS in changing strategic thinking in planning and how this might conflict with the current PSS research concern in improving usefulness of tools.

AB  - Personal beliefs about what knowledge is and how we understand, integrate and apply knowledge (known as personal epistemologies) are entrenched in the process of decision-making. Evidence-based medicine in all its forms brings with it the need for an ever more sophisticated appreciation of individual patients’ perspectives and ‘scientific’ perspectives within the clinical encounter. However, current theoretical perspectives on personal epistemology focus more on scientific ways of knowing where knowledge is abstracted and logical. We conducted semi-structured interviews to investigate medical students’ personal epistemological thinking towards the end of their second year of training at a new medical school in the South West of England. Whilst responses were varied, students appeared to express predominantly simplistic levels of epistemological thinking according to current developmental models of personal epistemology. However, the process of professional identity formation together with epistemological thinking brought together both scientific and experiential ways of knowing in a way that has largely been ignored by current theorists in the domain of personal epistemology.

AB  - Perceptron Neural Networks (PNNs) are essential components of intelligent systems because they produce efficient solutions to problems of overwhelming complexity for conventional computing methods. Many papers show that PNNs can approximate a wide variety of functions, but comparatively, very few discuss their limitations and the scope of this paper. To this aim, we define two classes of Boolean functions – sensitive and robust –, and prove that an exponentially large set of sensitive functions are exponentially difficult to compute by multi-layer PNNs (hence incomputable by single-layer PNNs). A comparatively large set of functions in the second one, but not all, are computable by single-layer PNNs. Finally, we used polynomial threshold PNNs to compute all Boolean functions with quantum annealing and present in detail a QUBO computation on the D-Wave Advantage. These results confirm that the successes of PNNs, or lack of them, are in part determined by properties of the learned data sets and suggest that sensitive functions may not be (efficiently) computed by PNNs.

KW  - Psychiatric symptoms
AB  - Amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) and ketamine have emerged as major drug problems in China, and chronic extensive exposure to these substances frequently co-occurs with psychiatric symptoms. This study compares the psychiatric symptoms of patients reporting ATS use only, ATS and ketamine use, or ketamine use only who were admitted to an inpatient psychiatry ward in Wuhan, China between 2010 and 2011. Data on 375 study participants collected during their ward admission and extracted from their clinical records included their socio-demographics, scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and urine toxicology screens.
Results
The ketamine-only group had significantly lower total BPRS scores and significantly lower scores on Thinking Disorder, Activity, and Hostility-Suspicion BPRS subscales than the ATS-only and ATS + ketamine groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The ketamine-only group also had significantly higher scores on the subscales of Anxiety-Depression and Anergia. The ATS-only group had significantly higher scores on subscales of Thinking Disorder, Activity, and Hostility-Suspicion and significantly lower scores on Anxiety-Depression and Anergia subscales than the ketamine-only and ATS + ketamine groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A K-means cluster method identified three distinct clusters of patients based on the similarities of their BPRS subscale profiles, and the identified clusters differed markedly on the proportions of participants reporting different primary drugs of abuse. The study findings suggest that ketamine and ATS users present with different profiles of psychiatric symptoms at admission to inpatient treatment.

AI’s utilization is near-ubiquitous from the prediction of novel materials to reducing computational overhead for material simulations; its value has been demonstrated time and again by both theorists and experimentalists. There is, however, a worrying trend toward large datasets and overparameterized models being all we need to accelerate science through accurate and robust machine learning systems.

KW  - Complexity and emergent properties
AB  - In this review, we will discuss in four scenarios our challenges to offer possible solutions for the puzzle associated with the epilepsies and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. We need to recognize that (1) since quite old times, human wisdom was linked to the plural (distinct global places/cultures) perception of the Universe we are in, with deep respect for earth and nature. Plural ancestral knowledge was added with the scientific methods; however, their joint efforts are the ideal scenario; (2) human behavior is not different than animal behavior, in essence the product of Darwinian natural selection; knowledge of animal and human behavior are complementary; (3) the expression of human behavior follows the same rules that complex systems with emergent properties, therefore, we can measure events in human, clinical, neurobiological situations with complexity systems’ tools; (4) we can use the semiology of epilepsies and comorbidities, their neural substrates, and potential treatments (including experimental/computational modeling, neurosurgical interventions), as a source and collection of integrated big data to predict with them (e.g.: machine/deep learning) diagnosis/prognosis, individualized solutions (precision medicine), basic underlying mechanisms and molecular targets. Once the group of symptoms/signals (with a myriad of changing definitions and interpretations over time) and their specific sequences are determined, in epileptology research and clinical settings, the use of modern and contemporary techniques such as neuroanatomical maps, surface electroencephalogram and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and imaging (MRI, BOLD, DTI, SPECT/PET), neuropsychological testing, among others, are auxiliary in the determination of the best electroclinical hypothesis, and help design a specific treatment, usually as the first attempt, with available pharmacological resources. On top of ancient knowledge, currently known and potentially new antiepileptic drugs, alternative treatments and mechanisms are usually produced as a consequence of the hard, multidisciplinary, and integrated studies of clinicians, surgeons, and basic scientists, all over the world. The existence of pharmacoresistant patients, calls for search of other solutions, being along the decades the surgeries the most common interventions, such as resective procedures (i.e., selective or standard lobectomy, lesionectomy), callosotomy, hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy, added by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), neuromodulation, and more recently focal minimal or noninvasive ablation. What is critical when we consider the pharmacoresistance aspect with the potential solution through surgery, is still the pursuit of localization-dependent regions (e.g.: epileptogenic zone (EZ)), in order to decide, no matter how sophisticated are the brain mapping tools (EEG and MRI), the size and location of the tissue to be removed. Mimicking the semiology and studying potential neural mechanisms and molecular targets – by means of experimental and computational modeling – are fundamental steps of the whole process. Concluding, with the conjunction of ancient knowledge, coupled to critical and creative contemporary, scientific (not dogmatic) clinical/surgical, and experimental/computational contributions, a better world and of improved quality of life can be offered to the people with epilepsy and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, who are still waiting (as well as the scientists) for a paradigm shift in epileptology, both in the Basic Science, Computational, Clinical, and Neurosurgical Arenas.

AB  - Geographic information systems (GIS) and transportation modeling have been developing in their respective fields separately. However, the geographic focus of GIS and the geographic nature of transportation make the use of GIS in transportation modeling both a logical choice and a motivation for modeling enhancement. This chapter first explains how the topological data structure underlying the design of vector GIS fits well the needs of data handling for transportation modeling. It then discusses the use and value of GIS in transportation modeling in three areas: (1) GIS for the four-step transportation models and for specific transportation modeling interests such as accessibility modeling and land use-transportation integrated (LUTI) modeling; (2) GIS visualization capabilities for presenting transportation modeling output and for facilitating visual thinking and knowledge construction; and (3) the potential of and challenges to GIS in transportation modeling amid rapid development of big-data technologies and new mobility.

AB  - In the last decades, companies have shifted from traditional business models based on selling products to product-service systems (PSS). Despite this tendency, there is a paucity of complete methodologies and tools to guide companies on how the transition should occur. To address this issue, the goal of this research is to present a complete framework to support manufacturing companies in the servitization journey. This novel proposal involves the application of design thinking to define the value proposition integrated with a PSS oriented business model creation, that goes beyond generic methods normally applied; and the specification of business process architecture to support PSS implementation. This research followed a prescriptive approach by means of action research technique. Key findings of the framework application are presented.

AB  - The multitude of microorganism species and the amount of data requiring examination is increasing day by day, which has made it very difficult to make informative determinations and analysis to be conducted by human labour. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are crucial in mitigating these difficulties. AI is a multidisciplinary field that tries to imitate human-like abilities through learning, analysing, problem-solving and interpretation via digital systems. It can take part in many fields where human labour is required. It is widely used in various scientific disciplines and industries, including biotechnology, microbiology, medicine, etc. Machine learning, a subbranch of AI, is one of the most frequently used auxiliary methods. Critical topics are examined rapidly and meaningfully via machine-learning such as drug production, microbial detection, antimicrobial resistance, vaccine predictions, and disease diagnoses. The aim of this chapter is to highlight the relevance of computational methods for the determination of microbial metabolites which are mainly described in literatures. These computational methods are related with the advanced AI tools of data/genome mining, multivariate data analysis, molecular networking, mathematical modelling, and optimization. These novel methods create new perspectives to the isolation and/or determination of microbial metabolites which are unwanted or essential to human health.

AB  - Social acceptance is considered the main non-technical barrier to the development of bioenergy projects. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review aimed to cover a lack in state-of-the-art literature about socio-cultural factors affecting the acceptance of biogas projects at a global scale. Moreover, this study is aimed at identifying which methods are used for studying this phenomenon, with a focus on the Life Cycle Thinking-oriented ones. Journal articles and conference proceedings were considered. At the end of the screening phases, 54 documents were selected and reviewed. The results showed that acceptance concerns two main issues: biogas plants and its presence in a given location and digestate application on fields. This review showed different results between high-income and low-middle-income countries. As regards the former, trust was the most mentioned socio-cultural factor. Education, as well as women's living conditions were considered important in the latter. However, a contextualisation of every outcome based on local peculiarities is needed in order to understand in a better way the accepting/refuting phenomena of the projects. As regards the second objective of this study, Life Cycle Analysis resulted the most widespread Life Cycle Thinking methodology. In conclusion, the outcomes of this work may be useful to identify the non-technical factors and the most suitable approach that should be considered for a successful implementation of site-specific biogas projects.

AB  - The scope of human learning and development poses a radical challenge for cognitive science. We propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. We specifically propose that children’s learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.

This paper presents a comprehensive toolkit that can help educators teach programming with an emphasis on collaboration, and provides suggestions for its effective pedagogical implementation. The toolkit comprises the Talkoo kit with physical computing plug-and-play modules and a visual programming environment. The key suggestions are inspired by the results of the evaluation studies which show that children (aged 14–18 in a sample group of 34 students) are well motivated when working with the toolkit but lack confidence in the kit’s support for collaborative learning. If the intention is to move beyond tools and code in computer education to community and context, thus encouraging computational participation, collaboration should be considered as a key aspect of physical computing activities. Our approach expands the field of programming with physical computing for teenage children with a focus on empowering teachers and students with not only a kit but also its appropriate classroom implementation for collaborative learning.

AB  - The debate around analogy in modern physics that focuses on its role as a logical inference often correspondingly overlooks its historical dimension and the other equally important functions and aspects that are intertwined with this dimension. Inspired by a close investigation of the primary sources and archival material of a few historical actors, this paper lays out a framework on analogy-making which preserves as much as possible its historical complexity. While not losing sight of the logical role, our framework puts a special emphasis on the heuristic process, and aims at offering to the historian and philosopher of science as well as the physicist some tools to capture the subtle functions of analogical reasoning involved in such a process. After having traced it out theoretically, we make use of this framework to interpret the growth of the ideas of two remarkable physicists dealing with the multifaceted notion of vacuum in 20th century physics. We first consider the trajectory followed by John A. Wheeler, between the 1960s and 1970s, towards (in his own words) a “geology of the vacuum”; and then examine, starting from the hitherto neglected Japanese reception of the idea of Dirac sea in the early 1930s, the pathway that led Yoichiro Nambu to the discovery of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The advent of memristors and the continuing research and development in the field of brain-inspired computing could allow realization of a veritable “thinking machine”. In this study, ZnO-based memristors were fabricated using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering method. The ZnO oxide layer was prepared by incorporating silver nanocrystals (NCs). Several synaptic functions, i.e. nonlinear transmission characteristics, short-term potentiation, long-term potentiation/depression, and pair-pulse facilitation, were imitated in the memristor successfully. Furthermore, the transition from synaptic behaviors to bipolar resistive switching behaviors of the device was also observed under repeated stimulus. It is speculated that the switching mechanism is due to the formation and rupture of the conductive Ag filaments and the corresponding electrochemical metallization. The experimental results demonstrate that the Ag/Ag:ZnO/Pt memristor with resistive switching and several synaptic behaviors has a potential application in neuromorphic computing and data storage systems.

AB  - The co-occurrence of delusions and other symptoms at the onset of psychosis is a challenge for theories about the aetiology of psychosis. This paper explores the relatedness of delusions about the experience of thinking (thought insertion, thought withdrawal, and thought broadcasting) and auditory verbal hallucinations by describing their trajectories over a 20-year period in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, affective and other psychosis, and unipolar depression nonpsychosis. The sample consisted of 407 participants who were recruited at index hospitalization and evaluated over six follow-ups over 20 years. The symptom structure associated with thought insertion included auditory verbal hallucinations, somatic hallucinations, other hallucinations, delusions of thought-dissemination, delusions of control, delusion of self-depreciation, depersonalization and anxiety. The symptom constellation of thought withdrawal included somatic hallucinations, other hallucinations, delusions of thought dissemination, delusions of control, sexual delusions, depersonalization, negative symptoms, depression, and anxiety. The symptom constellation of thought broadcasting included auditory verbal hallucinations, somatic hallucinations, delusions of thought-dissemination, delusion of self-depreciation, fantastic delusions, sexual delusions, and depersonalization. Auditory verbal hallucinations and delusions of self-depreciation were significantly associated with both thought insertion and thought broadcasting. Thought insertion and thought withdrawal were significantly associated with other hallucinations, delusions of control, and anxiety; thought withdrawal and thought broadcasting were significantly related to sexual delusions. We hypothesize that specific symptom constellations over time might be explained as the product of pseudo-coherent realities created to give meaning to the experience of the world and the self of individuals in psychosis based on both prior top-down and ongoing bottom-up elements.

But a close look at the way people actually talk reveals an abundance of apparent imprecision in the form of metaphor: ideas are ‘light bulbs’, crime is a ‘virus’, and cancer is an ‘enemy’ in a ‘war’. In this article, we review recent evidence that metaphoric language can facilitate communication and shape thinking even though it is literally false. We first discuss recent experiments showing that linguistic metaphor can guide thought and behavior. Then we explore the conditions under which metaphors are most influential. Throughout, we highlight theoretical and practical implications, as well as key challenges and opportunities for future research.

AB  - An enduring challenge in mathematics education is to create learning environments in which students generate, refine, and extend their intuitive and informal ways of reasoning to more sophisticated and formal ways of reasoning. Pressing concerns for research, therefore, are to detail students’ progressively sophisticated ways of reasoning and instructional design heuristics that can facilitate this process. In this article we analyze the case of student reasoning with analytic expressions as they reinvent solutions to systems of two differential equations. The significance of this work is twofold: it includes an elaboration of the Realistic Mathematics Education instructional design heuristic of emergent models to the undergraduate setting in which symbolic expressions play a prominent role, and it offers teachers insight into student thinking by highlighting qualitatively different ways that students reason proportionally in relation to this instructional design heuristic.

AB  - Microbiomics is the science of characterizing microbial community structure, function, and dynamics. It has great potential to advance our understanding of plant–soil–microbe processes and interaction networks which can be applied to improve ecosystem restoration. However, microbiomics may be perceived as complex and the technology is not accessible to all. The opportunities of microbiomics in restoration ecology are considerable, but so are the practical challenges. Applying microbiomics in restoration must move beyond compositional assessments to incorporate tools to study the complexity of ecosystem recovery. Advances in metaomic tools provide unprecedented possibilities to aid restoration interventions. Moreover, complementary non-omic applications, such as microbial inoculants and biopriming, have the potential to improve restoration objectives by enhancing the establishment and health of vegetation communities.

AB  - This chapter presents an overview of the turbinates. To the best of our knowledge, it was a New Yorker, William M. Jarvis, MD, who in 1882 described three cases of utilizing a snare to affect a partial turbinectomy. At the dawn of the 20th century, most surgeons were promoting total inferior turbinectomy not only for nasal airway obstruction but astoundingly also for hearing impairment and tinnitus. The turbinate enlargement or “hypertrophy” is neither the cause nor a complication of hearing loss. Fortunately, and for the most part, dazed blunders and egregious errors in thinking by esteemed experts, for the most part, have remedied itself through scientific studies, since the late 19th century. This chapter traces the more than a century long history of turbinate thinking and surgery offering both sides of the turbinate debate in their “own words.” All the various procedures used to reduce the inferior turbinate are presented. To be as fair minded as possible, numerous authors are quoted, spanning more than one hundred years; some observed and reported the serious adverse effects of aggressive turbinate surgery, pleading for a conservative approach to inferior turbinate surgical intervention, while others claimed that turbinectomy was without any serious sequelae which is challenged by the facts.

AB  - Summary
The primary visual cortex is one of the most well understood regions supporting the processing involved in sensory computation. Following the popularization of high-density neural recordings, it has been observed that the activity of large neural populations is often constrained to low dimensional manifolds. In this work, we quantify the structure of such neural manifolds in the visual cortex. We do this by analyzing publicly available two-photon optical recordings of mouse primary visual cortex in response to visual stimuli with a densely sampled rotation angle. Using a geodesic metric along with persistent homology, we discover that population activity in response to such stimuli generates a circular manifold, encoding the angle of rotation. Furthermore, we observe that this circular manifold is expressed differently in subpopulations of neurons with differing orientation and direction selectivity. Finally, we discuss some of the obstacles to reliably retrieving the truthful topology generated by a neural population.

AB  - Scales of Need for Cognition (NFC), Typical Intellectual Engagement (TIE), and Epistemic Curiosity (EC) measure intellectual curiosity (IC). These scales correlate strongly and have been factor-analyzed individually but not together. Here N=396 (143 males) undergraduates completed measures of NFC, TIE, and EC. Six factors, labeled Intellectual Avoidance, Deprivation, Problem Solving, Abstract Thinking, Reading, and Wide Interest, were identified. TIE is the broadest scale, measuring all factors except Deprivation; NFC measures Intellectual Avoidance and Problem Solving, plus Abstract Thinking and Deprivation to a lesser degree; and EC largely measures Deprivation. Moreover, Reading may not fit in the IC domain; higher-order factor analysis indicated that, whereas items measuring Reading loaded more strongly on their first-order factor, items measuring the other factors strongly loaded on a general factor of IC. These results are significant for understanding the contents of these scales, and for future scale development.

In this paper we address the practice of mediation and moderation analysis using linear regression in the pages of Behaviour Research and Therapy and offer some observations and recommendations, debunk some popular myths, describe some new advances, and provide an example of mediation, moderation, and their integration as conditional process analysis using the PROCESS macro for SPSS and SAS. Our goal is to nudge clinical researchers away from historically significant but increasingly old school approaches toward modifications, revisions, and extensions that characterize more modern thinking about the analysis of the mechanisms and contingencies of effects.

AB  - AI education aims to nurture convergence talents equipped with various knowledge and AI capabilities. However, the educational programs developed so far are designed for less than 10 sessions. This is insufficient time for students to understand artificial intelligence algorithms, utilize the learned principles of artificial intelligence, and expand by converging with various knowledge. Since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. Therefore, it is necessary to study the following AI education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. Experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students’ responses were better in the AI-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes.

AB  - The rational counterfactual is identified from the factual and the knowledge of the laws that govern the relationships between the antecedent and the consequent of the factual, which maximizes the attainment of the desired consequent. However, the attainment of the desired consequent is not perfect and is, in fact, limited, which makes these counterfactuals bounded rational counterfactuals. In counterfactual thinking, factual statements such as “The COVID-19 afflicted the world, and the world economy contracted by 3%,” has the counterfactual “The COVID-19 did not afflict the world, and the world economy grew by 3%.” In this chapter, we use intelligent machines that use AI to build bounded rational counterfactuals. It is observed that intelligent machines can achieve bounded rational counterfactual better than human agents. In general, quantifiable factual easily has bounded rational counterfactuals when compared to qualitative counterfactuals.

We then go on to consider non-symmetric all-at-once systems that arise in approximation of time-dependent problems, discuss causality and the parallel-in-time paradigm, suggesting an approach that involves preconditioning initial value problems with time-periodic problems.

It also addresses issues that pertain to human judgment and how people employ rules of thumb and heuristics to problem-solving situations. Various modes of engineering are discussed along with the complexities and concerns within each: cognitive systems engineering, control engineering, software engineering, industrial engineering, performance engineering, and several others. A distinction is also made between technical performance measures and key performance parameters. A list of leading indicators, insights, and requirements are then delineated among the various aspects of system engineering. Finally, an overall analysis of systems thinking, which concerns the process of understanding how various systems are implemented, is provided.

AB  - Dynamically changing real world applications, demands for rapid and accurate machine learning algorithm. In neural network based machine learning algorithms, radial basis function (RBF) network is a simple supervised learning feed forward network. With its simplicity, this network is highly suitable to model and control the nonlinear systems. Existing RBF networks in literature are applied to static applications and also faces challenges such as increased model size, neuron removal, improper center selection etc leading to erroneous output. To overcome the challenges and handle complex real world problems, this paper proposes a new optimum steepest descent based higher level learning radial basis function network (OSDHL-RBFN). The proposed OSDHL-RBFN implements major components inspired from the human brain for efficient learning, adaptive structure and accurate classification. Higher level learning and thinking components of the proposed network are sample deletion, neuron addition, neuron migration, sample navigation and neuroplasticity. These components helps the classifier to think before learning the samples and regulates the learning strategy. The knowledge gained from the trained samples are used by the network to identify the incomplete sample, optimal center and bond strength of hidden & output neurons. Adaptive network structure is employed to minimize classification error. The proposed work also uses optimum steepest descent method for weight parameter update to minimize the sum square error. OSDHL-RBFN is tested and evaluated in both static and dynamic environments on nine benchmark classification (binary and multiclass) problems for balanced, unbalanced, small, large, low dimensional and high dimensional datasets. The overall and class wise efficiency of OSDHL-RBFN is improved when compared to other RBFN’s in the literature. The performance results clearly show that the proposed OSDHL-RBFN reduces the architecture complexity and computation time compared to other RBFN’s. Overall, the proposed OSDHL-RBFN is efficient and suitable for dynamic real world applications in terms of detection time and accuracy. As a case study, OSDHL-RBFN is implemented in real time remote health monitoring application for classifying the various abnormality levels in vital parameters.

AB  - This chapter presents a philosophical argument about the “structure vs agency” debate—one of the central debates in social sciences. I do not argue for the primacy of either of the two but suggest an empirically vindicated view about the nature of thinking, in light of which the traditional debate as well as the notion of “social agency,” is redundant. I argue that thinking is contingent on the weightings of the synaptic connections between neuronal groups grounding it. In turn, socialization is a process of adjusting or conditioning the appropriate synaptic connection weightings. Both conscious (reasoning) and unconscious (intuitions) determinants of sociologically nontrivial actions derive from perceptual encounters with our sociophysical environment. In turn, agents—as social scientists use the term—simply do not exist. Finally, I appeal to neuroscientific evidence and show that we still qualify as agents, if only with regards to sociologically trivial actions.

AB  - Aerial access networks have been envisioned as a promising 6 G technology to enhance the service experience in underserved areas where terrestrial base stations do not exist. In such scenarios, a hierarchical model of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is considered to provide aerial computing services for ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this study, we investigate a hierarchical aerial computing system to optimally orchestrate the limited computation resources in both HAPs and UAVs. For offloading services, we formulate a joint resource allocation problem to maximize service satisfaction for terrestrial IoT devices. To solve this problem, we employ the ideas of game theory with centralized decision and decentralized execution. Through the Stackelberg-evolutionary game model, the HAP works as a leader, and selects its price strategy based on the evolutionary learning process. As followers, individual UAVs make decisions to partially offload their computing tasks by considering different objectives. According to the interactive control paradigm, our proposed method can get reciprocal advantages for HAPs, UAVs, and ground IoT devices while adaptively handling dynamic aerial network conditions. Finally, extensive simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm to increase the usability of edge servers’ computational resources. Compared with other existing state-of-the-art aerial network offloading protocols, we can improve the profits of system throughput, resource usability and UAV fairness up to 10 %, 10 %, and 15 %, respectively.

AB  - Introduction
Applying a complex systems perspective to public health evaluation may increase the relevance and strength of evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities. In this review of methods, we aimed to: (i) classify and describe different complex systems methods in evaluation applied to public health; and (ii) examine the kinds of evaluative evidence generated by these different methods.
Methods
We adapted critical review methods to identify evaluations of public health interventions that used systems methods. We conducted expert consultation, searched electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), and followed citations of relevant systematic reviews. Evaluations were included if they self-identified as using systems- or complexity-informed methods and if they evaluated existing or hypothetical public health interventions. Case studies were selected to illustrate different types of complex systems evaluation.
Findings
Seventy-four unique studies met our inclusion criteria. A framework was developed to map the included studies onto different stages of the evaluation process, which parallels the planning, delivery, assessment, and further delivery phases of the interventions they seek to inform; these stages include: 1) theorising; 2) prediction (simulation); 3) process evaluation; 4) impact evaluation; and 5) further prediction (simulation). Within this framework, we broadly categorised methodological approaches as mapping, modelling, network analysis and ‘system framing’ (the application of a complex systems perspective to a range of study designs). Studies frequently applied more than one type of systems method.
Conclusions
A range of complex systems methods can be utilised, adapted, or combined to produce different types of evaluative evidence. Further methodological innovation in systems evaluation may generate stronger evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities in our complex world.

AB  - Objectives
There are irregularities in investment cases generated by the Mental Health Compartment Model. We discuss these irregularities and highlight the costing techniques that may be introduced to improve mental health investment cases.
Methods
This analysis uses data from the World Bank, the World Health Organization Mental Health Compartment Model, the United Nations Development Program, the Kenya Ministry of Health, and Statistics from the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights.
Results
We demonstrate that the Mental Health Compartment Model produces irrelevant outcomes that are not helpful for clinical settings. The model inflated the productivity gains generated from mental health investment. In some cases, the model underestimated the economic costs of mental health. Such limitation renders the investment cases poor in providing valuable intervention points from the perspectives of both the users and the providers.
Conclusions
There is a need for further calibration and validation of the investment case outcomes. The current estimated results cannot be used to guide service provision, research, and mental health programming comprehensively.

AB  - An adequate strategy for achieving energy efficiency when designing a photovoltaic shading system (PVSS) shall find an equilibrium between sunlight heat gain and daylight transmittances through effective analysis tools in a building's early design phases. However, traditional simulation methods are either time-consuming or lacking architectonical thinking. This paper proposes a new method for architects to integrate thermal and daylighting performance by using parametric script modelling and optimize their balance with multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm in PVSS design. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the workflow of proposed integrated simulation method in PVSS design, and further compared the results with that of three single-objective optimizations under the same design requirement. The findings show that the integrated framework is a feasible method for PVSS design and can be extended into the design of other advance shading system or building integrated photovoltaic.

AB  - Agent-based models (ABMs) offer promise for realistically simulating human behaviours and interactions during emergency evacuations. This review aims to systematically assess the state of the art in ABM-based evacuation modelling with respect to methodologies, validation practices, and the associated challenges over the past decade. The review critically examines 134 studies from 2013 to 2023 that have applied ABMs for pedestrian evacuation simulation to synthesise current capabilities, limitations, and advancement pathways. Findings identify persistent challenges related to modeller bias, computational complexity, data scarcity for calibration and validation, and the predominance of simplistic rule-based decision-making models, while promise exists with the adoption of flexible behavioural frameworks, high-performance computing architectures, machine learning techniques for adaptive agent behaviours and surrogate modelling, and evolutionary computation methods for transparent rule generation. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among behavioural scientists, modellers, and emergency planners to enhance the realism and reliability of ABMs. By providing a critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art and proposing future research directions, this review aims to accelerate the development and application of ABMs that can meaningfully enhance the safety and resilience of communities facing emergencies.

AB  - In subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ), the disorganization dimension is a strong predictor of real-life functioning. “Conceptual disorganization” (P2), “Difficulty in abstract thinking” (N5) and “Poor attention” (G11) are core features of the disorganization factor, evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The heterogeneity of this dimension and its overlap with neurocognitive deficits are still debated. Within the multicenter study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses, we investigated electrophysiological and neurocognitive correlates of disorganization and its component items to assess the heterogeneity of this dimension and its possible overlap with neurocognitive deficits. Resting state EEG was recorded in 145 stabilized SCZ and 69 matched healthy controls (HC). Spectral amplitude was averaged in ten frequency bands. Neurocognitive domains were assessed by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). RAndomization Graphical User software explored band spectral amplitude differences between groups and correlations with disorganization and MCCB scores in SCZ. Correlations between disorganization and MCCB scores were also investigated. Compared to HC, SCZ showed increased delta, theta, and beta 1 and decreased alpha 2 activity. A negative correlation between alpha 1 and disorganization was observed in SCZ. At the item level, only “N5” showed the same correlation. MCCB neurocognitive composite score was associated with disorganization, “P2” and “N5”. Our findings suggest only a partial overlap between disorganization and neurocognitive impairment. The association of alpha 1 with the “N5” item suggests that some aspects of disorganization could be underpinned by the impairment of basic neurobiological functions that are only partially evaluated using MCCB.

AB  - With the progress of artificial intelligence, big data and functional neuroimaging technologies, brain computing has rapidly advanced our understanding of brain intelligence and brain disorders. We argue that existing data analytical methods have become insufficient for brain computing when dealing with multiple brain big data sources, because such methods mainly focus on flattening strategies and fail to work well for systematic understanding of the constituent elements of cognition, emotion and disease, as well as the intra- and inter-relations within and among themselves. To address this problem, we present in this paper a novel multi-source brain computing platform by Data-Brain driven systematic fusion. First, we formalize a series of behaviors surrounding the Brain Informatics-based investigation process, and present a conceptual model to systematically represent content and context of functional neuroimaging data. Then, we propose the systematic brain computing framework with multi-aspect fusion and inference to understand brain specificity and give uncertainty quantification, as well as its inspiration and applications for translational studies on brain health. In particular, a graph matching-based task search algorithm is introduced to help systematic experimental design and data sampling with multiple cognitive tasks. The study increases the interpretability and transparency of brain computing findings by inferring and testing multiple hypotheses taking into consideration the effect of evidence combination. Finally, multiple sources of knowledge (K), information (I) and data (D) are driven by a KID loop as the thinking space to inspire never-ending learning and multi-dimensional interactions in the connected social–cyber–physical spaces. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed brain computing method with systematic fusion.

AB  - Late-life depression (LLD) is a particularly debilitating illness. Older adults suffering from depression commonly experience poor outcomes in response to antidepressant treatments, medical comorbidities, and declines in daily functioning. This review aims to further our understanding of the brain network dysfunctions underlying LLD that contribute to disrupted cognitive and affective processes and corresponding clinical manifestations. We provide an overview of a network model of LLD that integrates the salience network, the default mode network (DMN) and the executive control network (ECN). We discuss the brain-based structural and functional mechanisms of LLD with an emphasis on their link to clinical subtypes that often fail to respond to available treatments. Understanding the brain networks that underlie these disrupted processes can inform the development of targeted interventions for LLD. We propose behavioral, cognitive, or computational approaches to identifying novel, personalized interventions that may more effectively target the key cognitive and affective symptoms of LLD.

AB  - Background and objectives
Depressed people hold positive beliefs about negative cognition (e.g., rumination is useful to find a solution), which may motivate those individuals to engage in sustained negative thinking. However, in reality, rumination often leads to unfavorable outcomes. Thus, such beliefs create a large discrepancy between one's expectations and the actual outcome. Therefore, we hypothesized that this prediction error would be associated with increased depressed mood.
Methods
We observed how people update their positive beliefs about negative cognition within a volatile environment, in which negative cognition does not always result in a beneficial outcome. Forty-six participants were offered two response options (retrieving a negative or positive personal memory) and subsequently provided either an economic reward or punishment. Retrieving a negative (rather than positive) memory was initially reinforced, although this action-outcome contingency was reversed during the task. In the control condition, positive memory retrieval was initially reinforced, although a contingency reversal was employed to encourage negative memory retrieval.
Results
Model-based computational modeling revealed that participants who showed a delay in switching from negative to positive (but not from positive to negative) responses experienced increased levels of depressed mood. This delay in switching was also found to be associated with depressive symptoms and trait rumination.
Limitations
The non-clinical nature of the sample may limit the clinical implications of the results.
Conclusions
Difficulty in updating positive beliefs (or outcome predictions) for negative cognition may play an important role in depressive symptomatology.

AB  - This study examined patterns of individual differences in the acquisition of the knowledge of the commutativity and complement principles in 115 five-to six-year-old children and explored the role of concrete materials in helping children understand the prinicples. On the basis of latent profile analysis, four groups of children were identified: The first group succeeded in commutativity tasks with concrete materials but in no other tasks; the second succeeded in commutativity tasks in both concrete and abstract conditions, but not in complement tasks; the third group succeeded in all commutativity tasks and in complement tasks with concrete materials, and the final group succeeded in all the tasks. The four groups of children suggest a developmental trend – (1) Knowledge of the commutativity and of the complement principles seems to develop from thinking in the context of specific quantities to thinking about more abstract symbols; (2) There may be an order of understanding of the principles – from the commutativity to the complement principle; (3) Children may acquire the knowledge of the commutativity principle in the more abstract tasks before they start to acquire the knowledge of the complement principle. This study contributes to the literature by showing that assessing additive reasoning in different ways and identifying profiles with classification analyses may be useful for educators to understand more about the developmental stage where each child is placed. It appears that a more fine-grained assessment of additive reasoning can be achieved by incorporating both concrete materials and relatively abstract symbols in the assessment.

AB  - Dual-process theories have become increasingly influential in the psychology of reasoning. Though the distinction they introduced between intuitive and reflective thinking should have strong developmental implications, the developmental approach has rarely been used to refine or test these theories. In this article, I review several contemporary dual-process accounts of conditional reasoning that theorize the distinction between the two systems of reasoning as a contrast between heuristic and analytic processes, probabilistic and mental model reasoning, or emphasize the role of metacognitive processes in reflective reasoning. These theories are evaluated in the light of the main developmental findings. It is argued that a proper account of developmental phenomena requires the integration of the main strengths of these three approaches. I propose such an integrative theory of conditional understanding and argue that the modern dual-process framework could benefit from earlier contributions that made the same distinction between intuition and reflective thinking, such as Piaget’s theory.

AB  - To power microelectronics for the internet-of-things applications, high-performance miniature batteries, called microbatteries, are critically important. Given their limited size, the three-dimensional design of microbatteries is key to maximizing their performance. Therefore, a computational strategy to identify the target battery architecture has major implications for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a data-driven 3D battery optimization system at the full cell level that combines an automatic geometry generator based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and highly accurate machine-learning-based performance simulators. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing high-performance 3D batteries with more than 5.5 times efficiency compared with the approach based on a randomized algorithm. One of the designed geometries displayed greater power and energy densities due to more than 10% reduced internal resistance than the reported state-of-the-art geometry at the current density of higher than 15.8 mA/cm2. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

AB  - Russian Literature turned fifty this year. In this editorial contribution, editor-in-chief Ellen Rutten reflects on the journal’s past, its current profile, and future editorial plans. As Rutten argues, Russian Literature has three distinguishing features. First, the journal has always generously invited other disciplines on board – and its transdisciplinary inclusivity has increased in recent years – while maintaining a steady gaze on Slavic literary studies. Second, the journal acts as a transnational and transcontinental scholarly contact zone – a status that cannot be isolated from our choice to publish both Anglophone and Russophone analyses. And third, Russian Literature brings together a range of scholarly voices and genres that is unusually broad for a scholarly periodical, through a strategy of active editorial outreach to young talents and leading experts in the field. Rutten concludes with a few words on upcoming volumes and plans, including new archival publications and volumes-in-the-making inspired by recent shifts in thinking about geopolitics, gender, and health and environment.

AB  - Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a transformative concept that must operate harmoniously within the constraints imposed by societal impacts. Noise-aware flight trajectory planning can address UAM’s community noise concerns. However, the traditional trajectory optimization paradigm requires repetitive computations of a flight’s noise footprints in complex urban environments and is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose virtual acoustic terrain, a novel concept to enable an efficient trajectory optimization paradigm. By applying acoustic ray tracing and the principle of reciprocity in a complex urban environment, we convert different noise constraints into 3D exclusion zones which UAM operations should avoid to maintain limited noise impact. It combines with the physical urban terrain to define an acceptable fly zone for non-repetitive noise-aware trajectory optimization. This framework provides a new angle to future urban area airspace management and can also accommodate other forms of societal constraints.

AB  - Dual Process Theories (DPT) of reasoning posit that judgments are mediated by both fast, automatic processes and more deliberate, analytic ones. A critical, but unanswered question concerns the issue of monitoring and control: When do reasoners rely on the first, intuitive output and when do they engage more effortful thinking? We hypothesised that initial, intuitive answers are accompanied by a metacognitive experience, called the Feeling of Rightness (FOR), which can signal when additional analysis is needed. In separate experiments, reasoners completed one of four tasks: conditional reasoning (N=60), a three-term variant of conditional reasoning (N=48), problems used to measure base rate neglect (N=128), or a syllogistic reasoning task (N=64). For each task, participants were instructed to provide an initial, intuitive response to the problem along with an assessment of the rightness of that answer (FOR). They were then allowed as much time as needed to reconsider their initial answer and provide a final answer. In each experiment, we observed a robust relationship between the FOR and two measures of analytic thinking: low FOR was associated with longer rethinking times and an increased probability of answer change. In turn, FOR judgments were consistently predicted by the fluency with which the initial answer was produced, providing a link to the wider literature on metamemory. These data support a model in which a metacognitive judgment about a first, initial model determines the extent of analytic engagement.

AB  - One of the most important challenges organisations’ faces to innovate is dealing with different types of barriers. Particularly, the case of manufacturing firms confronts several barriers, such as demand uncertainty, product imitation, lack of employees, scarcity of government funding, absence of internal and external financing. This paper aims to provide new insights regarding to the innovation barriers faced by the manufacturing firms. To do this, we implemented a computational model for analysing the barriers to innovation in the Colombian case. In this model, product and processes innovation are studied. It was concluded that for the innovation of process, the highly important barrier is the shortcoming of internal financing, while for the innovation of product is the lack of employees. Results show that the government expenditure is scarce compared to private and external investment.

AB  - Escape room is one of the media games that can improve the logic of thinking. Puzzles in the escape room traditionally have disadvantages because the type of puzzle that is made requires a lot of material. The purpose of this research is to produce a game with Escape Room as the basic theme with Virtual Reality technology. Virtual Reality technology is used to develop presence in users, attendance is about the intimacy of users with the gaming world. By using Virtual Reality, the puzzle elements that are created can be replaced regularly without the need to change the building’s skeleton. The development method used is a prototype model using Unity game machines. The research method was carried out using a questionnaire for user analysis. The application generated from this research is the Escape Room VR game that can be played on an Android smartphone that is compatible with Samsung Gear VR. The application can be used as an additional means for traditional Escape Room games.

AB  - While the idea that cognition is embodied appeared in the literature more than four decades ago, studies concerned with how and to what degree might the body and the environment influence creative thinking represent a relatively recent scientific endeavor. In this paper we wish to provide a critical examination of the core ideas of this new field, suggesting new experimental paradigms for testing the more radical and often ignored assertions of the embodied cognition program. We conclude that given the extremely small number of papers that are produced on this subject, as well as its obscurity within the scientific community, future research will have to expand its theoretical considerations greatly if the field is to survive and flourish.

The chapter provides the standard (including WHO) and innovative though still practical conceptualizations of patient safety and then progresses to recent more promising recent advances in human-centered, standardized, and AI-enabled patient safety (including safety as design thinking and system strategy). The chapter illustrates these developments with concrete use cases (in AI-enabled drug safety, clinical reports, and alarms) and augmentation with automation (including embedded, ambient, and command center safety intelligence). The chapter concludes by considering new and growing challenges in AI-driven patient safety (including data security, privacy, bias, and inconsistency) and emerging solutions (including blockchain, bias reduction, reproducibility, explainability, effectiveness, and safety in embedded design).

AB  - Enormous resources are invested in Europe for the transition into a sustainable, low carbon, and resilient society. In the construction sector, these concepts are slowly being applied to the renovation of the existing building stock by enforcing their deep and holistic renovation targeting sustainability, safety and resilience. Effectiveness of such an approach to the renovation with respect to traditional retrofit actions emerges when broadening the time frame of the analyses, shifting from the construction time to a life cycle perspective. In this case, the potential of the holistic approach becomes clear in reducing costs, impacts on the inhabitants and impacts on the environment over the building life cycle. Within such a new perspective, new technology options are needed to innovatively combine structural retrofit, architectural restyling and energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, a new design approach conjugating the principles of sustainability, safety and resilience over the building life cycle is required. In such a transition, synergistic and cooperative work of researchers, design professionals, and all the stakeholders in the construction sector is required. In this paper, the basic features of an expanded Life Cycle Thinking (eLCT) approach will be presented, which not only entails the use of recyclable/reusable materials, but also encourages interventions carried out from the outside the buildings to reduce building downtime and avoid inhabitant relocation. In addition, such an expanded LCT fosters the adoption of reparable, easy maintainable, adaptable and fully demountable solutions, such as those featuring dry, demountable and pre-fabricated components. Finally, it addresses the need to account for the End of Life scenario from the initial design stages to guarantee selective dismantling and reuse or recycle to reduce construction waste. Finally, a discussion on the main barriers and challenges in the transition towards this new approach to the renovation of existing building stock is briefly presented.

The proposed APOS-slope framework allows for discussion of students’ cognitive development in relation to different conceptualizations of slope. As such, it may be adopted as a means to advance future research or as a way to plan instruction. In particular, the framework uses specific examples to consider interrelations between the ways of thinking about slope that have been reported to provide additional insight on how individuals understand this concept. The proposed framework contributes to the field by bringing together a number of past studies related to slope and providing a common ground under which these works might be interpreted.

AB  - Bars made of fiber reinforcement polymer (FRP) are in common usage for concrete reinforcing instead of steel reinforcing since steel could be affected by corrosion. The concrete beams reinforced by FRP bars have been studied mostly in longitudinal direction without shear reinforcement. The primary objective of this investigation was to design and advance an algorithm for selection procedure of the parameters influence on prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP. Six input parameters were used which represent geometric and mechanical properties of the bars as well as shear features. These parameters are: web width, tensile reinforcement depth, ratio of shear and depth, concrete compressive strength, ratio of FRP reinforcement, FRP modulus of elasticity and beam shear resistance. The searching algorithm is based on combination of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic principle or adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the obtained results ratio of shear and depth has the strongest influence on the prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP. Moreover, combination of tensile reinforcement depth and ratio of shear and depth is the most influential combination of two parameters on the prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP. Finally, combination of tensile reinforcement depth, ratio of shear and depth and FRP modulus of elasticity is the most influential combination of three parameters on the prediction of shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams by FRP.

AB  - In meditation practices that involve focused attention to a specific object, novice practitioners often experience moments of distraction (i.e., mind wandering). Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of mind wandering during meditation practice through Electroencephalography (EEG) using linear metrics (e.g., oscillatory power). However, their results are not fully consistent. Since the brain is known to be a chaotic/nonlinear system, it is possible that linear metrics cannot fully capture complex dynamics present in the EEG signal. In this study, we assess whether nonlinear EEG signatures can be used to characterize mind wandering during breath focus meditation in novice practitioners. For that purpose, we adopted an experience sampling paradigm in which 25 participants were iteratively interrupted during meditation practice to report whether they were focusing on the breath or thinking about something else. We compared the complexity of EEG signals during mind wandering and breath focus states using three different algorithms: Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and Sample entropy (SampEn). Our results showed that EEG complexity was generally reduced during mind wandering relative to breath focus states. We conclude that EEG complexity metrics are appropriate to disentangle mind wandering from breath focus states in novice meditation practitioners, and therefore, they could be used in future EEG neurofeedback protocols to facilitate meditation practice.

AB  - We review how realistic frictions in information and/or rationality arrest general equilibrium (GE) feedbacks. In one specification, we maintain rational expectations but remove common knowledge of aggregate shocks. In another, we replace rational expectations with Level-k Thinking or a smooth variant thereof. Two other approaches, heterogeneous priors and cognitive discounting, capture the same essence while offering a gain in tractability. Relative to the full-information rational-expectation (FIRE) benchmark, all these modifications amount to attenuation of GE effects, especially in the short run. This in turn translates to either under- or overreaction in aggregate outcomes, depending on whether GE feedbacks are positive or negative in the first place. We review a few applications, with emphasis on monetary and fiscal policy. We finally discuss how the available evidence on expectations, along with other considerations, can help guide the choice among the various alternatives, as well as between them and FIRE.

AB  - Manufacturing companies are struggling with the implementation of Circular Economy, especially due to the uncertainty regarding its potential sustainability benefits. In particular, and despite digital servitization is advocated by several studies as a way to achieve environmental gains, circular business models based on digital servitization are not always sustainable due to burden shifting and unexpected consequences which are difficult to assess before implementation. This is particularly relevant for the Electrical and Electronics Equipment industry, which suffers structural weaknesses such as the dependance on critical raw materials and an increasing waste generation. However, literature lacks models and tools able to address the complexity inherent in the systemic micro-macro perspective envisioned by Circular Economy, while studies that quantitatively assess the sustainability impacts and trade-offs of digital servitization-based circular scenarios are limited. This article aims to develop a better understanding of how the sustainability impacts of circular and servitized scenarios can be assessed and quantified at the economic, environmental, and social level, adopting a systemic perspective through the development of a what-if simulation model. The model is implemented in a spreadsheet tool and applied to a digital servitization-based Circular Economy scenario inspired by the case of a company offering long-lasting, high-efficient washing machines as-a-service. Results show that digital servitization can actually lead to a win-win-win situation with net positive effects to the environment, the society, and the economy. This result is based on the joint application of product design for digitalization and life extension, pay-per-use business models, and product reuse. These results are robust within a significant range of key parameters values. Practitioners and policymakers may use the model to support the evaluation of different circular and servitized scenarios before implementation.

AB  - The paper focuses on the assessment of cognitive skills within Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). In response to the global shift to remote learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic, VLEs, which include learning management systems (LMS) and online collaboration platforms, gained prominence. The proposed work leverages an established Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory to propose eight metrics, which collectively form a part of Cognitive Evaluation Metrics (CEM). The proposed metrics introduce a novel computational approach for multimode evaluation of learners’ cognitive abilities for each learning task within a learning environment. The paper details the formalism for the evaluation of the metrics and makes a contribution towards the potential of the proposed methodology to evaluate cognitive abilities. Additionally, the work implements CEM integration into the learner module of a Game-Based Learning (GBL) environment. Analysis of simulations in the GBL environment, along with statistical analysis, provides insights into the normal distribution of cognitive metrics. This reveals diverse ranges in various abilities such as long or short term memory, working memory, reasoning, attention, and processing speed. The paper also explores the impact of virtual assistants, which highlights their limited relevance to enhance cognitive abilities but serve as valuable on-demand support resources.

AB  - Summary
The symmetric, lattice-like spatial pattern of grid-cell activity is thought to provide a neuronal global metric for space. This view is compatible with grid cells recorded in empty boxes but inconsistent with data from more naturalistic settings. We review evidence arguing against the global-metric notion, including the distortion and disintegration of the grid pattern in complex and three-dimensional environments. We argue that deviations from lattice symmetry are key for understanding grid-cell function. We propose three possible functions for grid cells, which treat real-world grid distortions as a feature rather than a bug. First, grid cells may constitute a local metric for proximal space rather than a global metric for all space. Second, grid cells could form a metric for subjective action-relevant space rather than physical space. Third, distortions may represent salient locations. Finally, we discuss mechanisms that can underlie these functions. These ideas may transform our thinking about grid cells.

AB  - Creative thinking plays a vital role in almost all aspects of human life. However, little is known about the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying creative thinking. Based on a cross-validation based predictive framework, we searched from the whole-brain connectome (34,716 functional connectivities) and whole genome data (309,996 SNPs) in two datasets (all collected by Southwest University, Chongqing) consisting of altogether 236 subjects, for a better understanding of the brain and genetic underpinning of creativity. Using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking score, we found that high figural creativity is mainly related to high functional connectivity between the executive control, attention, and memory retrieval networks (strong top-down effects); and to low functional connectivity between the default mode network, the ventral attention network, and the subcortical and primary sensory networks (weak bottom-up processing) in the first dataset (consisting of 138 subjects). High creativity also correlates significantly with mutations of genes coding for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Combining the brain connectome and the genomic data we can predict individuals' creativity scores with an accuracy of 78.4%, which is significantly better than prediction using single modality data (gene or functional connectivity), indicating the importance of combining multi-modality data. Our neuroimaging prediction model built upon the first dataset was cross-validated by a completely new dataset of 98 subjects (r = 0.267, p = 0.0078) with an accuracy of 64.6%. In addition, the creativity–related functional connectivity network we identified in the first dataset was still significantly correlated with the creativity score in the new dataset (p<10−3). In summary, our research demonstrates that strong top-down control versus weak bottom-up processes underlie creativity, which is modulated by competition between the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems. Our work provides the first insights into both the neural and the genetic bases of creativity.

AB  - Summary
In 2020, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) made ten “bold predictions,” including that “the clinical relevance of all encountered genomic variants will be readily predictable, rendering the diagnostic designation ‘variant of uncertain significance (VUS)’ obsolete.” We discuss the prospects for this prediction, arguing that many, if not most, VUS in coding regions will be resolved by 2030. We outline a confluence of recent changes making this possible, especially advances in the standards for variant classification that better leverage diverse types of evidence, improvements in computational variant effect predictor performance, scalable multiplexed assays of variant effect capable of saturating the genome, and data-sharing efforts that will maximize the information gained from each new individual sequenced and variant interpreted. We suggest that clinicians and researchers can realize a future where VUSs have largely been eliminated, in line with the NHGRI’s bold prediction. The length of time taken to reach this future, and thus whether we are able to achieve the goal of largely eliminating VUSs by 2030, is largely a consequence of the choices made now and in the next few years. We believe that investing in eliminating VUSs is worthwhile, since their predominance remains one of the biggest challenges to precision genomic medicine.

AB  - Math discussions are important when learning math. Explaining one’s thinking, listening to other’s thoughts, and reflecting are but a few of the benefits derived from discussions held in class. However, with the growth of online courses, how do math discussions change when in an online setting? While much research exists about math discussions in classrooms, there is not much research on math discussions held online. Due to the important role of discussions in learning math, along with the growing trend of online classes, this study begins to take a look at how students make sense of and keep track of each other’s comments in an online discussion. In these online discussions, turn taking is not as intuitive as face-to-face interactions. Making sense of the discussion sequence and theme can also be challenging. In this study, I found that students used terms that represented mathematical operations to better explain their thought processes and also kept track of how their peers used these terms as well. These findings suggest that, for these students, when in an online discussion, the terms used were of importance when trying to make their thinking clear to their classmates. Also, in these groups, the mathematical terms were commonly used and re-used by more than one individual in trying to gain a consensus in their group thinking. These findings are important when thinking about how to best foster math discussion and learning in an online environment and for designing online classes that institutions use to supplement or support students.

Most importantly, if they have the required skills and competencies to catch the opportunity offered by companies at the fourth industrial revolution where we notice the trend of automation and data exchange and IoT, cloud computing and cognitive computing have taken the lead. Our target participants in the survey include students from public and private universities in Bangladesh who will perform in the job market and who are already in the market. This is how we can bridge the gap between employers' expectations and students' perceptions of skills and competencies they acquire before entering the job market. After surveying and analyzing data collected from 361 undergraduate and graduate-level students, we found that both business and technology impact employment. Students are aware of the changing job market scenario, and they are trying to have those skills which will make them competent compared to the early years, but they are not prepared enough to accept the challenges faced in industry 4.0. This paper will be helpful for both the academicians to be aware of the future trend of the market so that they can prepare students to fight the challenges and do future research on them. At the same time, employers can get some ideas how students are thinking right now and how much training and development opportunity they should arrange for the newly recruited graduates who have lack expertise but if they are trained up, can be a source of strength for the companies.

AB  - Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become ubiquitous in biology. Recently, there has been a push for using scRNA-seq snapshot data to infer the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) steering cellular function. To date, this aspiration remains unrealized due to technical and computational challenges. In this work we focus on the latter, which is under-represented in the literature. We took a systemic approach by subdividing the GRN inference into three fundamental components: data pre-processing, feature extraction, and inference. We observed that the regulatory signature is captured in the statistical moments of scRNA-seq data and requires computationally intensive minimization solvers to extract it. Furthermore, current data pre-processing might not conserve these statistical moments. Although our moment-based approach is a didactic tool for understanding the different compartments of GRN inference, this line of thinking—finding computationally feasible multi-dimensional statistics of data—is imperative for designing GRN inference methods.

AB  - Chaperonins are known to maintain the stability of the proteome by facilitating the productive folding of numerous misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins and are thus essential for cell viability. Despite their established importance, the mechanism by which chaperonins facilitate protein folding remains unknown. Computer simulation techniques are now being employed to complement experimental ones in order to shed light on this mystery. Here we review previous computational models of chaperonin-mediated protein folding in the context of the two main hypotheses for chaperonin function: iterative annealing and landscape modulation. We then discuss new results pointing to the importance of solvent (a previously neglected factor) in chaperonin activity. We conclude with our views on the future role of simulation in studying chaperonin activity as well as protein folding in other biologically relevant confined contexts.

AB  - Nursing students’ higher-level thinking skills are ideally assessed through constructed-response items. At the baccalaureate level in North America, however, this exam format has largely fallen into disuse owing to the labor-intensive process of scoring written exam papers. The authors sought to determine if automated essay scoring (AES) would be an efficient and reliable alternative to human scoring. Four constructed-response exam items were administered to an initial cohort of 359 undergraduate nursing students in 2016 and to a second cohort of 40 students in 2018. The items were graded by two human raters (HR1 & HR2) and an AES software platform. AES approximated or surpassed agreement and reliability measures achieved by the HR1 and HR2 with each other, and AES surpassed both human raters in efficiency. A list of answer keywords was created to increase the efficiency and reliability of AES. Low agreement between human raters may be explained by rater drift and fatigue, and shortcomings in the development of Item 1 may have reduced its overall agreement and reliability measures. It can be concluded that AES is a reliable and cost-effective means of scoring constructed-response nursing examinations, but further studies employing greater sample sizes are needed to establish this definitively.

AB  - In this chapter, we introduce a new way of thinking about neurocognitive functioning and related dysfunction. We discuss how structural wiring patterns, global rhythms in deep structures, and electrochemical gain from neurotransmitters play a key role in the internal dynamics of what the brain is doing. Importantly, together, these elements dictate how the brain can or cannot obtain different brain states. Simultaneously, disruption in intrinsic structures and internal dynamics alters the energetic landscape causing some brain states to become more favorable or less favorable. Importantly, we go on to describe how landscapes arise from structural connectomes, and how these connections can dictate spontaneous behavioral patterns and tendencies in normal as well as pathologic states, such as a depressed patient being stuck in a self-ruminating and negative state. Resting-state fMRI also provides a keyhole into these processes as the entire set of the structural connectome creates the patterns of functional connectivity seen in resting-state brain activity.

AB  - This paper studies the information processing behavior of a decision maker (DM) who can only process a subset of all information he receives: before taking an action, the DM receives sequentially a number of signals and decides whether to process or ignore each of them as it is received. The model generates an information processing behavior consistent with that documented in the psychological literature: first, the DM chooses to process signals that are strong; second, his processing strategy exhibits confirmation bias if he has a strong prior belief; third, he tends to process signals that suggest favorable outcomes (wishful thinking). As an application I analyze how the Internet and the induced change in information availability affects the processing behavior of the DM. I show that providing more/better information to the DM could strengthen his confirming bias.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Nuclear Receptors (NRs) are highly relevant drug targets, for which small molecule modulation goes beyond a simple ligand/receptor interaction. NR–ligands modulate Protein–Protein Interactions (PPIs) with coregulator proteins. Here we bring forward a cooperativity mechanism for small molecule modulation of NR PPIs, using the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ), which describes NR–ligands as allosteric molecular glues. The cooperativity framework uses a thermodynamic model based on three-body binding events, to dissect and quantify reciprocal effects of NR–coregulator binding (KID) and NR–ligand binding (KIID), jointly recapitulated in the cooperativity factor (α) for each specific ternary ligand·NR·coregulator complex formation. These fundamental thermodynamic parameters allow for a conceptually new way of thinking about structure–activity-relationships for NR–ligands and can steer NR modulator discovery and optimization via a completely novel approach.

AB  - The food sector in Qatar is confronted with formidable challenges due to its harsh environmental conditions. Striving for total food self-sufficiency in such an environment would inevitably exert pressure on the energy and water sectors. This heightened demand for energy and water translates into increased costs and escalates environmental impacts. Consequently, this study embarks on an in-depth analysis of food production within the context of Qatar's energy-water-food nexus, aiming to demonstrate how varying degrees of food self-sufficiency may impact the demand on Qatar's water and energy sectors, as well as on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, this study demonstrates to what extent specific subsystems within the nexus can be modified to enhance sustainability. An energy-water-food nexus is meticulously crafted within the proposed framework to elucidate the intricate interdependencies among these sectors, incorporating pertinent external variables. These interconnections are then transmuted into a system dynamics model (SDM), facilitating a nuanced exploration of potential transformations and their ripple effects. Furthermore, a life-cycle thinking approach explicitly tailored to Qatar was implemented to estimate GHG emissions accurately. Four distinct scenarios are rigorously examined using the SDM, spanning from a status quo perspective to ambitious transitions toward full food self-sufficiency. The findings of the scenarios indicate that scenario 4, which partially provides the country with its food demands locally using desalinated water, treated wastewater, and groundwater and satisfies 20 % of its energy demand from solar energy, is the most ideal with an annual 5.36 × 1010 kWh/year energy consumption, 1.73 × 1012 l/year water demand, and 3.26 × 1010 kg CO2 eq./year emissions. The outcomes underscore the imperative for prioritizing less energy-intensive resources to mitigate overall energy consumption. Additionally, achieving an optimal national scenario necessitates a judicious equilibrium between food imports and domestic production.

AB  - Risk and return are interdependent in a stock portfolio. To achieve the anticipated return, comparative risk should be considered simultaneously. However, complex investment environments and dynamic change in decision making criteria complicate forecasts of risk and return for various investment objects. Additionally, investors often fail to maximize their profits because of improper capital allocation. Although stock investment involves multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), traditional MCDM theory has two shortfalls: first, it is inappropriate for decisions that evolve with a changing environment; second, weight assignments for various criteria are often oversimplified and inconsistent with actual human thinking processes. In 1965, Rechenberg proposed evolution strategies for solving optimization problems involving real number parameters and addressed several flaws in traditional algorithms, such as their use of point search only and their high probability of falling into optimal solution area. In 1992, Hillis introduced the co-evolutionary concept that the evolution of living creatures is interactive with their environments (multi-criteria) and constantly improves the survivability of their genes, which then expedites evolutionary computation. Therefore, this research aimed to solve multi-criteria decision making problems of stock trading investment by integrating evolutionary strategies into the co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model. Since co-evolution strategies are self-calibrating, criteria evaluation can be based on changes in time and environment. Such changes not only correspond with human decision making patterns (i.e., evaluation of dynamic changes in criteria), but also address the weaknesses of multi-criteria decision making (i.e., simplified assignment of weights for various criteria). Co-evolutionary evolution strategies can identify the optimal capital portfolio and can help investors maximize their returns by optimizing the preoperational allocation of limited capital. This experimental study compared general evolution strategies with artificial neural forecast model, and found that co-evolutionary evolution strategies outperform general evolution strategies and substantially outperform artificial neural forecast models. The co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model avoids the problem of oversimplified adaptive functions adopted by general algorithms and the problem of favoring weights but failing to adaptively adjust to environmental change, which is a major limitation of traditional multi-criteria decision making. Doing so allows adaptation of various criteria in response to changes in various capital allocation chromosomes. Capital allocation chromosomes in the proposed model also adapt to various criteria and evolve in ways that resemble thinking patterns.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The presence of a nearby tethered functional group (G, G = tertiary amide or amine) can significantly impact the rate of cleavage of an Si–O bond. We report here an in situ1H NMR spectroscopic investigation of the relative rates of cleavage of model substrates containing two different Si–O substructures, namely alkoxydisiloxanes [GRO–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3] and carbodisiloxanes [GR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3]. The trends in the relative rates (which slowed with increasing chain length, with a notable exception) of alkoxydisiloxane hydrolyses were probed via computation. The results correlated well with the experimental data. In contrast to the hydrolysis of the alkoxydisiloxanes, the carbodisiloxanes were not fully hydrolyzed, but rather formed an equilibrium mixture of starting asymmetric disiloxane, two silanols, and a new symmetrical disiloxane. We also uncovered a facile siloxy-metathesis reaction of an incoming silanol with the carbodisiloxane substrate [e.g., Me2NR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiMe3 + HOSiEt3 ⇋ Me2NR–Si­(Me2)–O–SiEt3 + HOSiMe3] facilitated by the pendant dimethylamino group, a process that was also probed by computation.

AB  - In this chapter, we introduce how connectomics can provide an improved understanding of the structural and functional organization of the human brain which can be applied for intracerebral brain surgery. In particular, such connectomic thinking expands our ability to improve patient functional outcomes after surgery beyond mere motor and language functions by also considering the anatomy responsible for complex cognitive functions. We introduce the concept of “disconnection surgery,” where the surgical decisions when removing a tumor can be thought of a series of specific cuts that we plan to perform on the periphery of the tumor such that we can disconnect the tumor from the surrounding networks. Connectomics allows us to define the risks associated with specific tumors and surgical decisions, which can subsequently guide the operation but also tailor preoperative patient discussion. Novel mathematical concepts from the field of network neuroscience on graph theory are also introduced so as to better define truly eloquent brain regions on an individualized basis.

AB  - Bio-inspired computing is a field of study that Lois lee knits together subfields related to the connectionism, social behavior and emergence. It is often closely related to the field of artificial intelligence as many of its pursuits can be linked to machine learning. It relies heavily on fields of biology, computer science and mathematics. Briefly it is the use of computers to model the living phenomena and simultaneously the study of life to improve the usage of computer. Biologically inspired computation is a major subset of natural computation areas of research. Some areas of study encompassed under the canon of biologically inspired computing and their biological counterparts are, genetic algorithms, evolution, biodegradability prediction, biodegradation, cellular automata, life emergent system ants, termites, bees, wasps, neural networks, artificial immune systems rendering patterning and animal skins, bird feathers, mollusk shells and bacterial colonies. Linder Mayer systems, plant structures, communication networks and protocol, epidemiology and the spared of disease, intra membrane molecular processes in living cells, excitable media forest fires the wave heart conditions axons and sensor networks sensory organs. Optimization techniques takes more bottom-up decentralized approach and often involves the methods of specifying a set of simple rules, a set of simple organisms which adhere to those rules and method of iteratively applying those rules for example, training virtual insect to investigate to an unknown terrain for finding food includes six simple rules which can be adopted. After several generations of rules application, it is usually the case where some forms of complex behavior get built upon complexity until the end results is something markedly complex and quite often completely counterintuitive from what the original rules would be expected to produce. For this reason, most technology-oriented solutions like neural network models, algorithms and other techniques came in to existence for accurate measurements and analysis that can be used to refine statistical inference and extrapolation as system complexity increases. The rules of nature inspired computing are the principle simple rules yet after being used for over millions of years have produced remarkably complex optimization techniques. All these techniques for developing software applications along with optimization techniques are discussed in the chapter.

AB  - Throughout history, diverse Maths have underpinned numerous important natural and physical science discoveries. In their initial development and application, these Maths were often incompletely or imperfectly understood, with constants and “fudge factors” needed to account for statistical uncertainties to advance a scientific discipline. Some polymaths have acted as philosophers in support of new ways of thinking, based on their novel discoveries about the natural and physical world. Deep Maths integral to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning (DL), are also subject to human imperfections (i.e., computational errors, operator assumptions) and stochastic uncertainties (i.e., modeling biases, convergence optimizers). Mathematicians and domain experts can collaborate to increase AI model accuracy by improving training data quality (i.e., curating, reducing dimensionality), mitigating human and machine biases, and understanding data contexts prior to query. Since the advent of DL and through the design of multilayered feedforward neural networks then large language models, scientists have applied advanced AI computing capabilities to push the limits of this technology trend. Recently, AI's capacity to uncover newly modeled insights has been hyped beyond the proven limits of DL model accuracy. History has witnessed the acceptance of new knowledge (primarily by peers) based on the accuracy and/or reproducibility of empirical observations and on varied interpretations of mathematical proofs. Societal enthusiasm for science or technology insertion is often limited by the general public's understanding of the underlying Maths and Deep Maths, and related human fears and concerns of displacement (i.e., lost jobs, ecological impact, less privacy, etc.). Today's proponents of societal progress based on new discoveries and technologies are motivated by a range of influences (i.e., humanity, control, security, profit, etc.), creating additional uncertainties that can deflect initial scientific enthusiasm and/or delay widespread adoption.

AB  - Given the current demands of the health care environment, the need for nurses minimally competent in clinical judgment, caring practice, advocacy and moral agency, collaboration, responsiveness to diversity, systems thinking, inquiry, and facilitation of learning is critical in light of ever-increasing contextual complexity and variability of patient needs. The Synergy Model provides an exemplary and relevant framework for clinical practice with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes. Tenets of accountability and professionalism are central to the model and, in its entirety, it provides a practical and useful approach for thinking about and redesigning educational products and processes in clinical settings.
