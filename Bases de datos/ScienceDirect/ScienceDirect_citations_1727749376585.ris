AB  - Regionalized life cycle assessment (LCA) is receiving more attention among LCA practitioners due to spatial variation in process efficiency of technological systems and current status of ecological systems. However, the role of ecosystem services (ES) in supporting technological activities is still ignored. Techno-Ecological Synergies in Life Cycle Assessment (TES-LCA) is a methodology that captures the interactions between and within technological and ecological systems, along a product's life cycle. It accounts for local and absolute environmental sustainability by comparing the demand and supply of ES at multiple spatial scales. To facilitate its wider adoption, the basic computational framework has been proposed in Part 1, which includes technologies and ecosystems in an integrated manner. To handle the complications induced by explicitly considering ES, which operate within servicesheds at multiple spatial scales, the TES-LCA computational structure is modified to account for spatial variation in technological and ecological systems in Part 2. The regionalized TES-LCA framework is demonstrated through an expanded case study to show its capability to capture different scenarios of regionalization, including variation in process efficiency, ecological carrying capacity (CC), characterization factors (CF), and the scales at which ES operate. The approach is then proved to be general and able to subsume existing approaches, such as regionalized LCA, GIS-LCA and recent extensions based on normalizing CF by ecological CC to calculate absolute sustainability metrics. It is recommended that the developed computational structure should be implemented in LCA software with the functionality for handling geographical information. Also, the regionalized information about ES demand and supply needs to be made available in future versions of life cycle inventory databases.

AB  - I invite readers to briefly explore the utility of mathematical modeling and systems thinking to properly address the impact of causal relationships associated with the higher levels of scattered corruption in the public administration on the constrained-based analysis of high-profile concerns for a sustainable economy. A recent and disastrous, but very educational, Brazilian experience is taken as the motivating example: the unequaled governmental corruption scandal hitherto known, which its epicenter has publicly being associated with the Brazilian state-owned energy company, Petrobras. Few, but remarkable, socio-environmental consequences thought to have been triggered by (or related to) the resulting political crisis, currently devastating the socioeconomic scenario in Brazil, are didactically selected for the in silico analysis proposed. Major findings show that: (a) a reductionist perspective may be illusive when comparing the distinct real-life production and consumption scenarios under corruption, and (b) nonlinear dynamics can efficiently provide theoretical plausibility for the emergent behaviors of the system, which are typically scenario-dependent and can drastically be altered when corruption evolves from a circumscribed into a scattered condition. In conclusion, these results corroborate the need for far greater attention to the issue of corruption–or more generally ethics–to aptly cope with a new array of complex global sustainability challenges that would have been unthinkable just a few decades, or years, ago.

AB  - The recent wave of elections won by right-wing worldwide brings up increased discussions biased by political polarization, including in social media. Social media data enables the investigation of the contexts where political polarization occurs, enabling to derive insights into how it affects human behavior. Related work has shown how computing techniques can be leveraged to understand political polarization in restricted scenarios, but the complexity of this behavior can be better understood when considered from different viewpoints. This article describes a multi-dimensional analysis framework to study the behavior of groups on Twitter in politically polarized scenarios. It can be applied to various themes where groups display stances that can be politically biased, and it aggregates a wide range of computational techniques in an innovative way to provide rich insights. The framework includes guidelines and techniques to: (a) collect data on Twitter to represent the groups; (b) automatically infer the political leaning of users; (c) derive topological properties of the groups’ social network and analyze political influence; (d) identify topics representing concerns at coarse and fine-grained granularity levels using a hybrid topic modeling approach; (e) identify psychological aspects based on linguistic cues, and (f) analyze the sources of information disseminated by the groups. Applying the framework in two case studies related to COVID-19 revealed patterns of behavior common to ideologies. We confirmed that the stances were politically motivated and that both groups, left/right, were subject to the echo chamber effect. Comparatively, the social structure of the right-oriented groups is more connected, and they rely on politicians and social media for information spreading. Left-oriented groups are less connected and more prone to facts. The psychological aspects reveal that both groups are emotionally distressed in arguing about being right, given their beliefs.

AB  - With rising natural gas demand, the issue of emergency management of gas leaks in communities is becoming more prominent. Resilience engineering is a successful approach to improving the system's ability in dealing with emergencies. In contrast to natural disasters such as floods and tornadoes, the consequences of a gas leak are closely related to the accident's evolutionary path. However, few reported works have taken the evolution of disasters into account in the assessment of resilience. Conventional methods fail to quantify the public safety performance of a disturbance caused by a natural gas leak. This work presents a novel dynamic approach to assessing resilience that incorporates the evolution of an incident and its interaction with emergency measures. A network structuring model of accident evolution is developed by the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) to analyze the potential accident propagation. The explosion consequence of gas leakage escalation is simulated based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the personnel injury criterion is adopted to quantify the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the system degradation. Then, the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is then used to track the interactions between accidents and emergency measures. Taking a real accident case (Shiyan underground gas explosion) as an example, the case study indicates that the proposed method can identify and prioritize emergency measures, as well as provide strong support for decision-making and arrangements in emergency management.

AB  - The control of attention was long held to reflect the influence of two competing mechanisms of assigning priority, one goal-directed and the other stimulus-driven. Learning-dependent influences on the control of attention that could not be attributed to either of those two established mechanisms of control gave rise to the concept of selection history and a corresponding third mechanism of attentional control. The trichotomy framework that ensued has come to dominate theories of attentional control over the past decade, replacing the historical dichotomy. In this theoretical review, I readily affirm that distinctions between the influence of goals, salience, and selection history are substantive and meaningful, and that abandoning the dichotomy between goal-directed and stimulus-driven mechanisms of control was appropriate. I do, however, question whether a theoretical trichotomy is the right answer to the problem posed by selection history. If we reframe the influence of goals and selection history as different flavors of memory-dependent modulations of attentional priority and if we characterize the influence of salience as a consequence of insufficient competition from such memory-dependent sources of priority, it is possible to account for a wide range of attention-related phenomena with only one mechanism of control. The monolithic framework for the control of attention that I propose offers several concrete advantages over a trichotomy framework, which I explore here.

AB  - This paper delivers an idea of weather-based optimization as a sustainable design strategy addressing the changing climate. An environment-driven design technique is introduced and tested at the urban and architectural scale. Utilizing the interplay between the architectural intention and weather influences (specifically solar radiation and wind effects), the optimal design solution for the urban configuration and architectural shape emerges. An exploratory case study near the amphitheater in Kosice, Slovakia, demonstrates the proposed approach. Through the real-time iterative analysis of the environmental performance of multiple design variants, an urban concept of offices/apartment blocks, reacting to the local wind and sun situation, is formed. The wind flow situation and comfort are investigated in a design loop, blending the newly developed AI-driven simulation prediction models of InFraRed11InFraRed: AI-based real-time analysis of wind, sun, and thermal comfort in the streets developed by the CIL of the AIT in Vienna, Austria. and the sun hours analysis in Ladybug with the Galapagos optimization within Grasshopper. The final step of this method is the design and subsequent wind and sun analysis of fluid-shaped lamellae in three variants acting as wind catchers/shading systems. Improved pedestrian wind comfort for outdoor sitting (more than 30% increase in areas suitable for short and prolonged sitting) and optimum sunlight hours (25% gain in sunlight during winter solstice) is achieved using the proposed technique.

AB  - Although deep learning has solved difficult problems in visual pattern recognition, it is mostly successful in tasks where there are lots of labeled training data available. Furthermore, the global back-propagation based training rule and the amount of employed layers represents a departure from biological inspiration. The brain is able to perform most of these tasks in a very general way from limited to no labeled data. For these reasons it is still a key research question to look into computational principles in the brain that can help guide models to unsupervisedly learn good representations which can then be used to perform tasks like classification. To that end, we start by recalling four key brain-inspired principles that relate to simple vision: modeling ”whats” and ”wheres” separately; including a time component; context dependency; and layer-wise learning. Then, we take these principles and use them to convey an a priori structure to our model that makes the learning problem easier. With that, our model is able to generate such high quality representations for the MNIST data set. We compare the obtained results with similar recent works and verify extremely competitive results.

AB  - A comprehensive approach is presented to analyze season’s coastal upwelling represented by weekly sea surface temperature (SST) image grids. The proposed model, core–shell clustering, assumes that the season’s upwelling can be divided into shorter periods of stability, time ranges, consisting of constant core and variable shell parts. A one-by-one core–shell clustering algorithm is provided. The algorithm parameters are automatically derived from the least-squares clustering criterion. The approach applies to SST gridded data for sixteen successive years (2004–2019) of coastal upwelling in the western Iberian coast, the northernmost branch of the Canary Current Upwelling System. Our results show that at each season, there are 3 to 5 time intervals, the ranges, at which the upwelling presents stable core patterns of relatively cold water surrounded by somewhat larger shell areas of warmer waters. Based on other experimental computations performed by our team, we conclude that this pattern is not just a purely local phenomenon but has a more global meaning. Inter-annual time series analysis are consistent among themselves and with existing expert domain knowledge.

Taken in aggregate, these encourage broader thinking in regards to possible dark-matter candidates — dark-matter need not be made of “WIMPs”, i.e., elementary particles with weak-scale masses and interactions. Facilities dedicated to nuclear physics are well-poised to investigate certain non-WIMP models. In parallel to this, developments in observational cosmology permit probes of the relativistic energy density at early epochs and thus provide new ways to constrain dark-matter models, provided nuclear physics inputs are sufficiently well-known. The emerging confluence of accelerator, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints permit searches for dark-matter candidates in a greater range of masses and interaction strengths than heretofore possible.

AB  - Recent research supports the efficacy of Strength at Home-Men's Program (SAH-M), a trauma-informed group intervention designed to reduce use of intimate partner violence (IPV) in veterans (Taft, Macdonald, Creech, Monson, & Murphy, 2016). However, change-processes facilitating the effectiveness of SAH-M have yet to be specified. Alexithymia, a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotional experience characterized by difficulty identifying and distinguishing between feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and use of an externally oriented thinking style, has been shown to predict PTSD severity and impulsive aggression; however, no studies have investigated the relationship between alexithymia and IPV. As such, the current study examined the role of improvements in alexithymia as a potential facilitator of treatment efficacy among 135 male veterans/service members, in a randomized control trial SAH-M. After an initial assessment including measures of IPV and alexithymia, participants were randomized to an Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU) condition or SAH-M. Participants were assessed three and six months after baseline. Results demonstrated a statistically significant association between alexithymia and use of psychological IPV at baseline. Moreover, participants in the SAH-M condition self-reported significantly greater reductions in alexithymia over time relative to ETAU participants. Findings suggest that a trauma-informed intervention may optimize outcomes, helping men who use IPV both limit their use of violence and improve deficits in emotion processing.

Deep learning involves much more than the deployment of technologies at the border, and is reordering what the border means, how the boundaries of political community can be imagined. Where the biometric border rendered the border mobile through its inscription in the body, the deep border generates the racialized body in novel forms that extend the reach of state violence. The deep border is written through the machine learning models that make the world in their own image – as clusters of attributes and feature spaces from which data examples can be drawn. The ‘depth’ that becomes imaginable in computer science models of the indefinite multiplication of layers in a neural network begins to resonate with state desires for a reach into the attributes of population. The border is spatially reimagined as a set of always possible functions, features, and clusters – as a ‘line of best fit’ where the fraught politics of the border can be condensed and resolved.

AB  - The manifestation of the intensity in the judgment of one alternative versus another in the peer comparison processes is a central element in some decision support techniques, such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). However, its contribution regarding quality (expected performance) with respect to the priority vector has not been evaluated so far. Using the Intentional Bounded Rationality Methodology (IBRM), this work analyzes the gains obtained from requiring the decision-maker to report an intensity judgment in pairs (AHP) with respect to a technique that only requires expressing a preference (Ordering). The results show that when decision-makers have low levels of expertise, it is possible that a less informative and computational cheap technique (Ordering) performs better than a more informative and computational expensive one (AHP). When decision-makers have medium and high levels of expertise, AHP technique obtains modest gains with respect to the Ordering technique. This study proposes a cost-benefit analysis of decision support techniques contrasting the gains of a technique that requires more resources (AHP) against other that require less resources (Ordering). Our results can change the managing approach of the information obtained from experts’ judgments.

AB  - Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are of great interest to healthcare organizations for their potential to improve patient care, yet their translation into clinical settings remains inconsistent. One of the reasons for this gap is that good technical performance does not inevitably result in patient benefit. We advocate for a conceptual shift wherein AI tools are seen as components of an intervention ensemble. The intervention ensemble describes the constellation of practices that, together, bring about benefit to patients or health systems. Shifting from a narrow focus on the tool itself toward the intervention ensemble prioritizes a “sociotechnical” vision for translation of AI that values all components of use that support beneficial patient outcomes. The intervention ensemble approach can be used for regulation, institutional oversight, and for AI adopters to responsibly and ethically appraise, evaluate, and use AI tools.

AB  - Time to collision (TTC) has been a key vehicle safety metric for decades. With the increasing prevalence of advanced driver assistance systems and vehicle automation, TTC and many related metrics are being applied to the analysis of more complicated scenarios, as well as being integrated into automation algorithms. While the TTC metric was originally conceived to be inclusive of generic two-dimensional situations, its applications has been mostly limited to one-dimensional scenarios. This paper derives general equations and algorithms using two-dimensional information. Additionally, methods from computational geometry, a field that didn’t exist when TTC was first used, are employed for the general case of computing TTC between bounding boxes. Parametric equations for lines play a prominent role and offer an elegant way to express the geometry of the scenarios described in this paper. Throughout, the approach is not to derive specific algebraic conditions as in previous efforts. Rather, the focus in on developing general algorithms for computation. The techniques presented are not necessary for traditional car following scenarios; but offer options for more complex situations that trade off analytic solutions for computational flexibility.

AB  - The molecular structure and energy distribution of organic compounds have a great influence on their adsorption capacity on the metal surface. However, there are still insufficient researches on the influence of energy distribution on adsorption properties of organic molecules. Herein, a family of porphyrin derivatives (TPyP-Et, TPyP-Oct, TPyP-Bn and TPyP-Al) bearing quaternary ammonium groups were synthesized for the first time as promising levelers for through-hole copper electrodeposition. Electrochemical tests revealed that all four TPyP derivatives displayed enhanced electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the physisorption capacity and chemical reaction activity of the TPyP molecules, as well as the adsorption capacity on the surface of the copper layer. Through optical and scanning electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffractometry, it was demonstrated that TPyP molecules are effective electroplating levelers. TPyP-Oct, with its longer carbon chain substituent, exhibited superior hole-filling performance in practical PCB experiments among the four compounds. This study expandes the application range of porphyrin compounds, analyzes the influence of organic molecular adsorption properties in copper electrodeposition, and provides theoretical guidance for the future study of organic compounds adsorbed on metal surfaces.

AB  - Summary
In light of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), the advent of functional neuroimaging, novel technologies and methods provide new opportunities to develop precise and personalized prognosis and diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry. Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. We further review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We also discuss explainable AI (XAI) and neuromodulation in a closed human-in-the-loop manner and highlight the ML potential in multi-media information extraction and multi-modal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research.

AB  - Self-relevant material has been shown to be prioritized over stimuli relating to others (e.g., friend, stranger), generating benefits in attention, memory, and decision-making. What is not yet understood, however, is whether the conditions under which self-related knowledge is acquired impacts the emergence of self-bias. To address this matter, here we used an associative-learning paradigm in combination with a stimulus-classification task to explore the effects of different learning experiences (i.e., deterministic vs. probabilistic) on self-prioritization. The results revealed an effect of prior learning on task performance, with self-prioritization only emerging when participants acquired target-related associations (i.e., self vs. friend) under conditions of certainty (vs. uncertainty). A further computational (i.e., drift diffusion model) analysis indicated that differences in the efficiency of stimulus processing (i.e., rate of information uptake) underpinned this self-prioritization effect. The implications of these findings for accounts of self-function are considered.

AB  - This paper reports on the results of a four-day teaching experiment that supported two algebra teachers to develop a combinatorial meaning for algebraic structure. The purpose of the teaching episodes was to support the teachers (a) to establish a combinatorial understanding for algebraic structure (Tillema & Burch, 2022) by generalizing the cubic identity, a+b3=a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3, as a symbolization of quantitative and combinatorial relationships out of a contextualized problem (Tillema & Gatza, 2016) and (b) to develop a combinatorial meaning as a mobilization of their understanding through a series of algebraic tasks (cf. Thompson et al., 2014). The findings from this study contribute to research literature on teachers’ mathematical meanings within secondary algebra by investigating how teachers’ combinatorial meanings developed and how differences in their combinatorial meanings impacted their algebraic reasoning. The findings demonstrate a combinatorial pathway for supporting the development of expanding and factoring as reversible polynomial operations (cf. Sangwin & Jones, 2017).

AB  - Efficient airport airside ground movement (AAGM) is key to successful operations of urban air mobility. Recent studies have introduced the use of multi-objective multigraphs (MOMGs) as the conceptual prototype to formulate AAGM. Swift calculation of the shortest path costs is crucial for the algorithmic heuristic search on MOMGs, however, previous work chiefly focused on single-objective simple graphs (SOSGs), treated cost enquires as search problems, and failed to keep a low level of computational time and storage complexity. This paper concentrates on the conceptual prototype MOMG, and investigates its node feature extraction, which lays the foundation for efficient prediction of shortest path costs. Two extraction methods are implemented and compared: a statistics-based method that summarises 22 node physical patterns from graph theory principles, and a learning-based method that employs node embedding technique to encode graph structures into a discriminative vector space. The former method can effectively evaluate the node physical patterns and reveals their individual importance for distance prediction, while the latter provides novel practices on processing multigraphs for node embedding algorithms that can merely handle SOSGs. Three regression models are applied to predict the shortest path costs to demonstrate the performance of each. Our experiments on randomly generated benchmark MOMGs show that (i) the statistics-based method underperforms on characterising small distance values due to severe overestimation; (ii) A subset of essential physical patterns can achieve comparable or slightly better prediction accuracy than that based on a complete set of patterns; and (iii) the learning-based method consistently outperforms the statistics-based method, while maintaining a competitive level of computational complexity.

The first wave is based on classical and operant conditioning. The second wave is based on targeting cognitions, or dysfunctional beliefs, that are assumed to contribute to distressing emotional experiences and problematic behaviors. The third wave is based, broadly, on acceptance and mindfulness. Collectively, all three waves may be understood from a computational neuropsychology perspective that is based on connectionist neural network models.

AB  - Preferences are important when thinking about macroeconomic problems and questions. Differences in preferences might, for example, explain cross-country variations in economic fundamentals. In recent years, differences in preferences across countries and cultures have been studied more frequently, usually concentrating on micro evidence. However, it is an open question as to how differences in average preferences affect the aggregate economy. Coming from a macroeconomic perspective, we test whether preferences stated in Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory, namely, reference point dependence and loss aversion, prevail on the aggregate and whether the average degree of loss aversion differs across countries. We find evidence of loss aversion for a broad set of OECD countries, while the average loss aversion clearly differs across these countries. We find little evidence that these differences could be linked to micro evidence. Furthermore, we analyse whether the different degrees of loss aversion correlate with economic fundamentals such as the level of GDP and consumption per capita. We find that indeed loss aversion is negatively correlated with GDP and consumption per capita and positively correlated with consumption smoothing.

AB  - Despite tremendous variation in the appearance of visual objects, primates can recognize a multitude of objects, each in a fraction of a second, with no apparent effort. However, the brain mechanisms that enable this fundamental ability are not understood. Drawing on ideas from neurophysiology and computation, we present a graphical perspective on the key computational challenges of object recognition, and argue that the format of neuronal population representation and a property that we term ‘object tangling’ are central. We use this perspective to show that the primate ventral visual processing stream achieves a particularly effective solution in which single-neuron invariance is not the goal. Finally, we speculate on the key neuronal mechanisms that could enable this solution, which, if understood, would have far-reaching implications for cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - In fluid analysis, there has been a long-standing problem: lacking a rigorous mathematical tool to map from a continuous flow field to finite discrete particles, hurdling the Lagrangian particles from inheriting the high resolution of a large-scale Eulerian solver. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework, the neural vortex method (NVM). NVM builds a neural-network description of the Lagrangian vortex structures and their interaction dynamics to reconstruct the high-resolution Eulerian flow field in a physically-precise manner. The key components of our infrastructure consist of two networks: a vortex detection network to identify the Lagrangian vortices from a grid-based velocity field and a vortex dynamics network to learn the underlying governing interactions of these finite structures. By embedding these two networks with a vorticity-to-velocity Poisson solver and training its parameters using the fluid data obtained from grid-based numerical simulation, we can predict the accurate fluid dynamics on a precision level that was infeasible for all the previous conventional vortex methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating highly accurate prediction results with low computational cost by predicting the evolution of the leapfrogging vortex rings system, the turbulence system, and the systems governed by Navier–Stokes (NS) equations with different external forces. We compare the prediction results made by NVM and the Lagrangian vortex method (LVM) for solving the NS equation in the periodic box and find that the relative error of the predicted velocity using NVM is more than 10 times lower than that of the LVM. Moreover, our method only requires data collected from a very short training window, more than 100 times smaller than the prediction period, which potentially facilitates data acquisition in real systems.

AB  - For better or worse, humans live a resource-constrained existence; only a fraction of physical sensations ever reach conscious awareness, and we store a shockingly small subset of these experiences in memory for later use. Here, we examined the effects of attention constraints on learning. Among models that frame selective attention as an optimization problem, attention orients toward information that will reduce errors. Using this framing as a basis, we developed a suite of models with a range of constraints on the attention available during each learning event. We fit these models to both choice and eye-fixation data from four benchmark category-learning data sets, and choice data from another dynamic categorization data set. We found consistent evidence for computations we refer to as “simplicity”, where attention is deployed to as few dimensions of information as possible during learning, and “competition”, where dimensions compete for selective attention via lateral inhibition.

However, traditional classification systems are not robust to such data modifications.

We provide an alternative framework to such problems based on adversarial risk analysis which we illustrate with examples. Computational, implementation and robustness issues are discussed.

AB  - Technological advances associated with computing power and the prospect of artificial intelligence have renewed interest on the economic feasibility of socialism. The question of such feasibility turns on whether the problem of economic calculation has fundamentally changed. In spite of the prospect of what King and Petty (2021) refer to as “technosocialism,” we argue that technological advances in computation cannot replace the competitive discovery process that takes place within the context of the market. We do so by situating the case for technosocialism in the context of the socialist calculation debate. Understood in these terms, technosocialism represents a restatement of the case for market socialism, which incorrectly framed the “solution” to economic calculation under socialism as one of computing data, rather than the discovery of context-specific knowledge that only emerges through the exchange of property rights. Therefore, the arguments put forth by Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek, and later Israel Kirzner and Don Lavoie, regarding the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism remains just as relevant today.

AB  - Technology enhanced learning (TEL) represents an expert and intelligent paradigm in which technological affordances are used to facilitate learners' acquisition of domain knowledge (DK), where Ubiquitous–Learning (u–learning) is a TEL instance that recreates situated and immersive settings. However in such settings, learners are stressed by diverse, heterogeneous, and simultaneous stimuli that challenge their cognitive skills, increase the cognitive load, trigger emotional reactions, and bias conduct. Thus this research proposes a smart Sequencing approach that enables TEL systems to lead students to regulate their learning process. The essence of the proposal is a holistic self–regulated learning (SRL) model that encourage students to develop higher–order thinking through the practice of metacognitive skills, motivational factors, and behavioral affairs to become aware of their own learning endeavors. The approach was applied as part of the sequencing module of a u–Learning system, where students follow its suggested cognitive strategies to assist them during the programming of control equipment. Results show that, although experimental subjects had to deal with higher cognitive load, they are expected to reach higher learning achievements than their control peers. The experience reveals how TEL systems are enabled to foster learners to handle their own apprenticeship processes. As a consequence, the smart sequencing functionality of TEL is cognitively enhanced to facilitate students the simultaneal acquisition DK and development of higher–order thinking.

AB  - Current discussions about educational policy and practice are often embedded in a mind-set that considers students who were born in an age of omnipresent digital media to be fundamentally different from previous generations of students. These students have been labelled digital natives and have been ascribed the ability to cognitively process multiple sources of information simultaneously (i.e., they can multitask). As a result of this thinking, they are seen by teachers, educational administrators, politicians/policy makers, and the media to require an educational approach radically different from that of previous generations. This article presents scientific evidence showing that there is no such thing as a digital native who is information-skilled simply because (s)he has never known a world that was not digital. It then proceeds to present evidence that one of the alleged abilities of students in this generation, the ability to multitask, does not exist and that designing education that assumes the presence of this ability hinders rather than helps learning. The article concludes by elaborating on possible implications of this for education/educational policy.

AB  - In this constantly evolving landscape of urbanization, the relationship between technology and automation, in regards to sustainability, holds immense significance. The intricate strands of human intelligence are seamlessly interwoven with the fabric of technological progress, giving rise to exquisite patterns of synergy and collaborative innovation. Automation is just another step in this process which started with the industrial revolution and now has paved way towards urbanization. Smart homes or home automation is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) based automation that has added into the comfort, ease, and quality of our living standards and is now being integrated to form the concept of Smart Cities. In the past decade, various techniques and processes of smart home automation have been proposed and implemented. To extend and translate the existing methods into new one, the understanding of the former is imperative to the research procedure. This review stands as a comprehensive exploration, diving into the pivotal role of intelligent systems and expert knowledge in driving the transformation of smart homes into sustainable smart cities. By meticulously analyzing and aggregating an array of contemporary techniques used in smart homes, this paper offers profound contributions to the intersection of urban evolution and technological innovation. The review’s holistic approach not only facilitates a deep understanding of smart homes’ contributions but also charts a course for innovative strategies in city planning, infrastructure, and technological integration. In bridging the gap between technology and sustainable urban development, this exploration underscores the transformative power of leveraging smart home techniques to lay the foundation for harmonious and forward-thinking smart cities. The technologies cover a wide range of methodologies and intelligent systems used for communication, security and management in an urban infrastructure. The paper focuses on analysis of the technology to provide an outlook into achieving the goal of sustainable smart cities and deal with challenges like scalability and big data computation. Our comprehensive analysis yields a holistic set of technology comparisons and illuminates the promising future prospects within this domain. The information is highly insightful in creating a bigger picture for adopting state of the art technologies like Federated Learning (FL), Digital Twin and Embedded Edge computing in better planning and infrastructure management in smart cities. These findings offer reliable and potent methods to chart not only the course of research but also to enhance these technologies for the betterment of mankind’s convenience and advancement.

KW  - Confabulation Theory
AB  - Confabulation Theory [Hecht-Nielsen R. Confabulation theory. Springer-Verlag; 2007] is the first comprehensive theory of human and animal cognition. Here, we briefly describe Confabulation Theory and discuss experimental results that suggest the theory is correct. Simply put, Confabulation Theory proposes that thinking is like moving. In humans, the theory postulates that there are roughly 4000 thalamocortical modules, the “muscles of thought”. Each module performs an internal competition (confabulation) between its symbols, influenced by inputs delivered via learned axonal associations with symbols in other modules. In each module, this competition is controlled, as in an individual muscle, by a single graded (i.e., analog) thought control signal. The final result of this confabulation process is a single active symbol, the expression of which also results in launching of action commands that trigger and control subsequent movements and/or thought processes. Modules are manipulated in groups under coordinated, event-contingent control, in a similar manner to our 700 muscles. Confabulation Theory hypothesizes that the control of thinking is a direct evolutionary outgrowth of the control of movement. Establishing a complete understanding of Confabulation Theory will require launching and sustaining a massive new phalanx of confabulation neuroscience research.

AB  - For decades, computing speeds seemingly doubled every 24 months by increasing the processor clock speed, thus giving software a “free ride” to better performance. This free ride, however, effectively ended by the mid-2000s. With clock speeds having plateaued and computational horsepower instead increasing due to increasing the number of cores per processor, the vision for parallel computing, which started more than 40 years ago, is a revolution that has now (ubiquitously) arrived. In addition to traditional supercomputing clusters, parallel computing with multiple cores can be found in desktops, laptops, and even mobile smartphones. This ubiquitous parallelism in hardware presents a major challenge: the difficulty in easily extracting parallel performance via current software abstractions. Consequently, this paper presents an approach that reduces the learning curve to parallel programming by introducing such concepts into a visual (but currently sequential) programming language called Snap!, which was inspired by MIT’s Scratch project. Furthermore, our proposed visual abstractions can automatically generate parallel code for the end user to run in parallel on a variety of platforms from personal computing devices to supercomputers. Ultimately, this work seeks to increase parallel programming literacy so that users, whether novice or experienced, may leverage a world of ubiquitous parallelism to enhance productivity in all walks of life, including the sciences, engineering, commerce, and liberal arts.

AB  - Human emotions play a vital role in overall well-being. With the advent of advance technologies growing interest has been observed in developing a multimodal emotion classification system that can accurately interpret human emotions. The article presents a comprehensive overview of a multimodal emotion classification system (Emo Fu-Sense) designed to capture the rich and nuanced nature of human emotions. Objective of Emo Fu-Sense is to integrates information from Electrocardiogram (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Electroencephalograph (EEG), respiration amplitude and body temperature to achieve holistic understanding of emotional states. To effectively extract information from multimodal data, designed system employs conventional methods with sophisticated machine learning algorithms including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a variety of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Recommended solution extracts column wise features independently from different modalities based on the windowing operation. Finally, feature fusion and modality biasing were used to combine the information from different modalities. The proposed method has not only highlighted the limitations of unimodal system but has achieved a classification accuracy of 92.62 %, with an average F1-Score of 93 % and 9.2 % of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Obtained results are better than existing state-of-the-art approaches. Evaluation of the multimodal emotion classification system was conducted on MAHNOB-HCI dataset, which encompasses a wide range of emotional expressions across various contexts and individuals. The integration of multiple modalities and advanced machine learning techniques enables a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states and highlights the significance of research and development in the field of affective computing.

AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students' inevitable use of AI chatbots. This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots.

AB  - Retrieving similar images is becoming an urgent need for us with the continuous growth of large-scale data. However, whether the dominant image retrieval methods are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or the recently emerging Visual Transformer (ViT), their complex computation, insufficient feature extraction, and mismatched weights greatly influence the efficiency and retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Pooling-based Visual Transformer with low complexity attention hashing (PTLCH) for image retrieval. First, a backbone network for Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) feature learning is designed to combine the pooling in CNN and the ViT to achieve the purpose of spatial dimensionality reduction while learning rich semantic information. Second, a low complexity attention (LCA) module is incorporated into PiT, which works by combining the positional deviation with the key matrix and the value matrix and then matrix multiplying with the query matrix. LCA explores rich contextual information to enable network learning of more granular feature information. Finally, a new loss framework is proposed where we focus on the effect of difficult and erroneous samples on accuracy. By using different improved cross-entropy losses, better weights are assigned to the learning samples of our network, which effectively improves learning hash coding. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets, CIFAR-10, ImageNet100, and MS-COCO, which have the highest mean average precision of 93.76%, 92.62%, and 90.60%, respectively.

AB  - 3D printing, more formally known as additive manufacturing (AM), has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry, with foreseeable benefits including greater structural efficiency, reduction in material consumption and wastage, streamlining and expedition of the design-build process, enhanced customisation, greater architectural freedom and improved accuracy and safety on-site. Unlike traditional manufacturing methods for construction products, metal 3D printing offers ready opportunities to create non-prismatic sections, internal stiffening, openings, functionally graded elements, variable microstructures and mechanical properties through controlled heating and cooling and thermally-induced prestressing. Additive manufacturing offers many opportunities for the construction sector, but there will also be fresh challenges and demands, such as the need for more digitally savvy engineers, greater use of advanced computational analysis and a new way of thinking for the design and verification of structures, with greater emphasis on inspection and load testing. It is envisaged that AM will complement, rather than replace, conventional production processes, with clear potential for hybrid solutions and structural strengthening and repairs. These opportunities and challenges are explored in this paper as part of a wider review of different methods of metal 3D printing, research and early applications of additive manufacturing in the construction industry. Lessons learnt for metal 3D printing in construction from additive manufacturing using other materials and in other industries are also presented.

The crucial aspects of the extraction technologies along with protocols and process parameters for designing unit operations have been emphasized. The parameters like solvent usage, substrate type, concentration, particle size, temperature, quality and storage of extract as well as stability of extraction have been elaborately discussed. The process optimization using mathematical and computational modeling highlighting information and communication technologies have been given importance aiming for a green and sustainable industry level scaleup. The findings indicate that the extraction processes vary significantly depending on the category of food and its structure. There is no single extraction method or universal set of process conditions identified for extracting all value-added products from respective sources. A comprehensive understanding of process parameters and their optimization as well as synergistic combination of multiple extraction processes can aid in enhancement of the overall extraction efficiency. Future efforts must be directed toward the design of integrated unit operations that cause minimal harm to the environment along with investigations on economic feasibility to ensure sustainable extraction systems.

AB  - Humans use two types of inferences: intuitive and logical. However, they are studied separately. A site for logical inference has not been found in the brain, but modeling it as a distributed neural network form is desirable. In this study, we propose an inference model of an intuitive search process in continuous and distributed associative memory (AM), and it switches to a symbolic mode, in which each step of association converges to a stable state of self-recollection, realizing step-by-step logic. Switching is evoked by biasing the associative gain upon finding a valued state during the intuitive inference. In this study, we show the computational model of symbolic inference via AM, and we verify its practicality by solving a maze task. We show the emergence of a tree search-like behavior with pruning.

AB  - Bettinger, J. S., K. J. Friston. Conceptual Foundations of Physiological Regulation incorporating the Free Energy Principle & Self-Organized Criticality. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV 23(x) 144-XXX, 2022. Since the late nineteen-nineties, the concept of homeostasis has been contextualized within a broader class of "allostatic" dynamics characterized by a wider-berth of causal factors including social, psychological and environmental entailments; the fundamental nature of integrated brain-body dynamics; plus the role of anticipatory, top-down constraints supplied by intrinsic regulatory models. Many of these evidentiary factors are integral in original descriptions of homeostasis; subsequently integrated; and/or cite more-general operating principles of self-organization. As a result, the concept of allostasis may be generalized to a larger category of variational systems in biology, engineering and physics in terms of advances in complex systems, statistical mechanics and dynamics involving heterogenous (hierarchical/heterarchical, modular) systems like brain-networks and the internal milieu. This paper offers a three-part treatment. 1) interpret "allostasis" to emphasize a variational and relational foundation of physiological stability; 2) adapt the role of allostasis as "stability through change" to include a "return to stability" and 3) reframe the model of homeostasis with a conceptual model of criticality that licenses the upgrade to variational dynamics.

AB  - In the context of urbanization and a growing population, cities and citizens are becoming more exposed and vulnerable to social and environmental changes, ranging from natural disasters like earthquakes and floods to uncertainties caused by issues related to climate change and complex social dynamics or even pandemics. There have been many debates about implementing resilience thinking that allow cities and communities to prepare for possible stresses and shocks. Although there are sets of frameworks aimed at building inclusive resilience strategies fostering participation and engagement, there is limited resilience-related literature on how to conceptualize participation. Through an extensive review of various kinds of publications on resilience, policy documents, and case studies, which emphasize the concepts of participation, coordination, and co-creation, this review explores and investigates how citizen participation is discussed and applied in the context of participatory resilience. We conclude that participatory approaches possess a great potential to enhance multi-stakeholder cooperation, social innovation, and capacity building for resilience. Realization of the potential of participatory resilience will remain limited, however, unless participation strategies and frameworks are made more transparent, inclusive, and context-sensitive.

AB  - A three-dimensional multi-scale discrete–continuum model (Finite Volume Method × Discrete Element Method, FVM × DEM) is developed for a discrete-based description of the mechanical behavior of granular soils in boundary value problems (BVPs). In such a scheme, the constitutive response of the material is derived through direct DEM computations on a representative volume element attached to each mesh element. The developed multi-scale approach includes the inertial effect in the stress homogenization formulation and serves to study the mechanism of propagation of seismic waves, in comparison with a more classical BVP simulation that adopts an advanced bounding surface plasticity model “P2PSand”. We start with a detailed and fair calibration and validation of these two models against laboratory tests for Toyoura sand under monotonic and cyclic loading. Then, the performance of the two approaches is compared for the case of a seismic wave loading passing through a saturated soil column with different relative densities, revealing several differences between the results of the two models.

AB  - The engineering, management, maintenance and upgrading of infrastructure requires fresh thinking to minimise the use of materials, energy and labour while still ensuring resilience. This can only be achieved by a full understanding of the performance of the infrastructure, both during its construction and throughout its design life, through the application of innovative sensor technologies and other emerging technologies. This approach covers the design and commissioning, construction process, exploitation and use and eventual decommissioning. Crucial elements of these emerging technologies are the innovative application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools, manufacturing processes and supply chain management processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its design life. In particular, advances in sensing technologies such as fibre-optic sensors and wireless sensor networks for structural health monitoring have a huge potential to transform the approaches to the design, the construction and the operation of an infrastructure. This briefing article gives some examples of the recent application of these advanced sensing technologies to structural health monitoring for a large number of construction sites and existing infrastructure.

AB  - There is a growing trend in modern architecture towards asymmetrical building layouts. This development can be attributed to the proliferation of cutting-edge production methods and structurally novel approaches. With the advent of computational design and digital manufacturing techniques, formerly static designs may now be modified to create one-of-a-kind, high-performance prototypes. Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is a cutting-edge production method that paves the way for new architectural designs, construction processes, and materials. Interesting possibilities for optimising structural elements are made possible by MAM because of its ability to deposit material just where it is structurally necessary. The construction sector places a premium on directed energy deposition additive manufacturing (DED AM) and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The adaptability of these two technologies in the construction industry and their possible future applications are explored in this literature review.

AB  - The wide expansion of digital technologies in higher education has introduced the need for an examination of the added value of various technological tools for quality teaching and active individual and collaborative learning. The current study explored whether and how the pedagogical design of an academic course, which developed a variety of digital literacy competencies, supported students in regulating collaborative technology-enhanced learning and helped them cope with the sense of psychological ownership over collaborative learning outcomes. In addition, we examined how these issues were expressed in cognitive, emotional and social aspects of students' perceived learning (Caspi & Blau, 2011). During four semesters, we conducted a qualitative analysis on reflective learning diaries, written by 78 graduate students studying education (N = 1870 codes). The bottom-up analysis focused on learning processes that enabled the development of various digital literacies conceptualized by the Digital Literacy Framework (DLF; Eshet-Alkalai, 2012): photo-visual, information, reproduction, branching, social-emotional, and real-time thinking skills. Furthermore, findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation and learning new technologies as an integral part of digital literacies. In addition, social-emotional statements expressed the development of effective communication and collaboration that enable students to cope with a sense of ownership over learning outcomes, and present different levels of teamwork: sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. Qualitative coding provided a more granulated perspective on perceived learning by differentiating between positive and negative aspects of emotional and social retrospection during the learning process. The findings contribute to educational theory by extending DLF and by providing new insights to the literature on students' perceived learning. We discuss the implications for instructional design and adoption of innovative pedagogy in higher education.

AB  - Patients with depression exhibit high rates of alexithymia, representing a major public health concern. We sought to examine relationships between depression severity and alexithymia as assessed by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the TAS-20 subscales of difficulty identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty describing feelings (DDF), and externally oriented thinking (EOT). Potentially relevant studies were obtained independently by two reviewers. Chi-square statistics based on the Q-test and I2 index assessed statistical heterogeneity between studies. Subgroup analyses were mainly used to explore sources of heterogeneity. Begg׳s test and Duval and Tweedie’ trim and fill were used to assess potential publication bias. Altogether, 3572 subjects from 20 study groups across 19 studies were included. Medium relationships were observed between depression and TAS-total score (TAS-TS), DIF, and DDF. There was also a weak relationship between EOT and depression. Subgroup analyses showed a stronger correlation between TAS-TS and depression assessed by self-reported tools than that assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The heterogeneity significantly decreased only in the subgroup analysis by depression tool. We conclude that alexithymia, as assessed by the TAS-20 and its subscales DIF and DDF, is closely related to depression. These relationships were affected by depression measurement tools.

In the presence of indivisible goods, the consumer problem is NP-Hard, and it appears unlikely that it can be optimally solved by a human. Two implications of this observation are that (i) households may imitate each other’s choices; (ii) households may adopt heuristics that give rise to the phenomenon of mental accounting.

AB  - In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gordon Wilson Memorial Flats (Wellington, New Zealand, 19551959) was instrumented for seismic engineering research and subjected to vibration testing. The research was prompted by new thinking about architectural design in the mid-twentieth century (i.e. modernism) that had caused a mismatch between structural assumptions in building codes (which relied on significant amounts of uncalculated stiffness inherent in 1920s building design) and the structural characteristics of new buildings that had, for example, greater areas of glazing. This type of research led to the revision of New Zealand building codes in the 1960s and informed Japanese processes for permitting buildings higher than 100 ft (305m). This paper outlines the research conducted and provides the context for understanding its significance. It is particularly topical given current proposals to instrument 400 Wellington buildings, creating the highest density of seismic instrumentation in any city.

AB  - Drawing on prior research, the value of scenario planning as a methodology for researching the future of purchasing and supply management (PSM) is explored. Using three criteria of research quality – rigour, originality and significance – it is shown how developing scenarios and analysing their implications present new, important research opportunities for PSM academics, practitioners, and leaders of the profession. Researching the future of PSM supports the identification of uncertainties and anticipates change across many units and levels of analysis of interest to PSM scholars and practitioners, such as the profession/discipline, markets/sectors, or organisations. Scenarios are particularly effective for: considering how the complex interaction of macro-environmental factors affects the PSM context; avoiding incremental thinking; surfacing assumptions and revealing significant blind spots. PSM research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia's (2011) call for prescience-oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research, enhancing sense-giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice, to better perform their adaptive role in society.

After eight years' thinking, i.e., in 2009, the authors began to manifest, put forward and carry out the thought of “physical equivalency”. By another eight years' practicing and experimenting, i.e., in 2017, the authors basically finished establishing the framework of Zhang equivalency. Now, it is the time to establish the complete theory in a brief manner. Therefore, concepts about mathematical equivalence simply termed equivalence are presented firstly including Ma equivalence (especially for robotics), and then concepts about physical equivalency simply termed equivalency are proposed. Meanwhile, concepts about Zhang equivalency as a kind of equivalency are further proposed, and concepts about gradient-dynamics equivalency simply termed gradient equivalency as a kind of equivalency are proposed as well. Furthermore, two specific applications are considered and investigated, which substantiate the efficacy of Zhang equivalency.

AB  - The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) claims that the cognitive processes that materially realise thinking are sometimes partially constituted by entities that are located external to an agent’s body in its local environment. We show how proponents of HEC need not claim that an agent must have a central nervous system, or physically instantiate processes organised in such a way as to play a causal role equivalent to that of the brain if that agent is to be capable of cognition. Focusing on the case of spatial memory, we make our argument by taking a close look at the striking example of Physarum Polycephalum plasmodium (i.e., slime mould) which uses self-produced non-living extracellular slime trails to navigate its environment. We will argue that the use of externalized spatial memory by basal organisms like Physarum is an example of extended cognition. Moreover, it is a possible evolutionary precursor to the use of internal spatial memory and recall in animals thus demonstrating how extended cognition may have emerged early in evolutionary history.

AB  - The conceptualization of emotions as unique to biological organisms and a flaw in human intelligence has been challenged in recent times. Artificial intelligence researchers defy the idea of emotions as solely biological and try to incorporate them in their agents' design. Emotions and feelings are now considered cognitive percepts that play an important role in decision making processes. Based on artificial intelligence discourses and inventions, this chapter explores how emotions are defined in the realm of artificial intelligence, what is their role in the agents' performance, and how and why they are being emulated. From improving human-machine interaction and achieving empathy, to providing machines with cognitive shortcuts for rational thinking, emotions could be a key element in building a coherent system of thought capable of organizing several kinds of knowledge. This could provide a way to finally pass the Turing test or to provide a smooth transformation of the human nature when we finally merge with the machines. The emulation of emotions is just another step in the objective of replicating the human, promoting a higher level of anthropomorphism in the field of artificial intelligence.

AB  - In the current information society, the need for securing human resources acquired with ICT competency is becoming a very important issue. In USA, England, Japan, India and Israel improving students’ ICT competency has become a pedagogical issue. Accordingly, education on ICT competency is changing in many countries emphasizing the basis of computer science. The Korean government revised the ICT curriculum of 2001 focused on the basic concepts and principles of computer science as educational policy in 2005. However, it is still difficult to determine a student’s ICT competency level and the outcome of ICT curriculum based on changed direction. Thereupon, this study has developed test tool for measuring the level of Korean elementary school students’ ICT competency based on computer science. In this study, ‘Content’ and ‘Information processing’ are established as the two axes of the test frame standard through literature research, consideration and discussion. The validity and reliability of questions are verified though the preliminary test and the main test tool has completed through question revisions considering the distribution of answers. About 40,000 students, roughly 1% of the total elementary school students, are selected for the main test. There were several findings made in this study. Korea’s elementary school students have a weakness in ‘algorithm and modeling’. Information processing stage has been found to vary by grade. A modified ‘Angoff method’ is used to confirm the spread of the ICT competency levels of the target students. From the results, the cutoff score employed to divide the subjects into three levels, excellent, average and below average, the ratio of excellent levels decreases and the ratio of below average increases in higher grades. To solve these problems, we need to emphasize algorithmic thinking oriented more principal of computer science in ICT curriculum. For more effective ICT elementary education, teaching and learning strategies appropriate for young children to teach computer science should be introduced.

AB  - Sustainable development is an expression that permeates large areas of knowledge. For it to be meaningful, environmental aspects must be considered as intertwined with economic and social aspects. This is a multidisciplinary effort that is made challenging by the task of synthesizing the many emerging contributions. This has limited theory development where the definition of mechanisms, assumptions, dynamics and the determination of the entities involved are largely left to the reader’s imagination. We suggest to engage with the rationale of agent-based modeling to better define the assumptions, mechanisms, and boundaries of sustainable development. For this, the O-part of the widely used ODD protocol for describing agent-based models (ABM) provides a standardized structure, which we here augment to OsDD to specifically take into account sustainability issues. Even without formulating and implementing the full ABM, using OsDD requires to be explicit about the mechanisms, assumptions, dynamics and the entities involved and thereby provides a common language for theory development.

AB  - With the rapid technological development of society brought on by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the demand for AI-literate workers will increase in the future. It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings.

AB  - Many research areas require simulating particle transport through scattering media. For instance, radiative transfer is useful for computer graphics and for neutron transport in nuclear physics. These transport simulations tend to be computationally expensive for problems involving large amounts of multiple scattering in generic geometries, requiring significant time to compute. Finding a fast solution for these types of problems remains an open area for research. Previous work shows that radiative transfer can be represented as a Feynman Path Integral over all paths between two points in a space. The path integral assigns a weight to each path based on the local curvature of the path, accumulating a transport kernel by summing the weights of all of the paths. Previous work demonstrated a Monte Carlo method for computing the radiative transfer Feynman path integral via repeatedly perturbing paths to generate new paths, using a discrete Frenet-Serret framework and an expensive root-solve calculation. The approach is highly parallelizable on the CPU, however computations require a supercomputer to complete in reasonable time. While a GPU implementation was considered for this previous approach, the root-solve and path representation mapped poorly to the GPU, hindering a reasonable implementation. In the present work, we propose a representation of paths as polylines, and a new curve perturbation method that guarantees production of a new unique path each execution while maintaining the boundary conditions of each path, but without the time-consuming root-solve. The new perturbation method’s structure maps well to the GPU, allowing implementation in CUDA which outperforms the CPU, and allows the utilization of GPU hardware.

We explore how the engagement in Fab Lab based leisure maker activities may be promoted, taking into account both the perspectives of adolescents and the potential of surrounding systems. For this, we conducted focus group discussions with N = 61 non-maker, adolescent girls and boys from 6th to 9th grade, to scrutinize hindering and promoting factors of their engagement in leisure maker activities, and to explore their preferences regarding the involvement of parents, teachers and peers while considering the ecological sustainability of the activities. A reflexive thematic analysis identified the hindering and promoting factors across different aspects of maker activities such as the purpose, location and setting, content, and learning processes. Implications for the promotion and design of maker activities, as well as implications for further research, are discussed.

AB  - The BICA Challenge is the challenge to create a general-purpose, real-life computational equivalent of the human mind using an approach based on biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICA). To solve it, we need to understand at a computational level how natural intelligent systems develop their cognitive, metacognitive and learning functions. The solution is expected to lead us to a breakthrough to intelligent agents integrated into the human society as its members. This outcome has the potential to solve many problems of the modern world. The article starts from the roadmap proposed by Dr. James Albus for a national program unifying artificial intelligence, neuroscience and cognitive science. The BICA Challenge is introduced in this context as a waypoint on the expanded roadmap. The gap between the state of the art and challenge demands is analyzed. Specific problems and barriers are identified, an approach to overcoming them is proposed, and an ultimate practical criterion for success is formulated. It is estimated that the BICA Challenge can be solved within a decade.

AB  - In the coming years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will likely give rise to profound changes in the field of emergency medicine, and medicine more broadly. This article discusses these anticipated changes in terms of 3 overlapping yet distinct stages of AI development. It reviews some fundamental concepts in AI and explores their relation to clinical practice, with a focus on emergency medicine. In addition, it describes some of the applications of AI in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, as well as some of the practical issues that they raise, the barriers to their implementation, and some of the legal and regulatory challenges they create.

AB  - Many decisions are made in a social context. These decisions may be interactive and involve cooperation or conflict, or they may be made individually but have consequences for others. The brain processes underlying social decisions are complex, requiring not only computations associated with valuation and comparison but also social-cognitive processes like inferring others' mental states and predicting their behaviors. Accordingly, progress in understanding social decision making comes from combinations of techniques, primarily from the fields of economics and neuroscience. A standard model has arisen that contends that interpreting social information relies on a network of brain regions – including the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the temporoparietal junction – and that information in turn feeds into the brain's system for valuation. Here, we review different types of social decisions, as well as the neural regions underlying their components.

AB  - Precision medicine looks for the integration of vast information data sets on the molecular and environmental origins of disease for the development of individualized, context-dependent diagnostics and therapies. To build predictive models of complex disease compliant with individual variability on genetic and socially determined conditions, it is necessary to have computationally efficient methods to handle, visualize, and integrate large data sets of different origins, in a multitude of formats and subject to different levels of confidentiality into a single framework. This involves the ability to comply with the big data paradigm under demanding conditions of performance and subject to time, computational power, and bioethical constraints. This is still an open problem; however, we can devise some ways in which big data analytics may join forces with bioinformatics, medical informatics, and computational systems biology in a fast and effective way, motivated with the success of approaches such as the one given by translational bioinformatics.

AB  - For industrial enterprises, the transformation to circular business models can be curbed both by operational tools and the lack of relevant data. Lean thinking has offered great flexibility in production processes and systems by challenging mass production practices, resulting in more “Lean” products with less waste. Lean design and Eco-design, associated with Industry 4.0 technologies, can be an efficient structured and methodological approach in developing products based on the circular economy strategies. Indeed, decisions made during the product design stage can significantly impact the sustainability of products throughout their life cycle. Hence, lean design combined with eco-design and Industry 4.0 represents an innovative model to include sustainability throughout the product life cycle. This paper explores the relationship between lean eco-design and I4.0 strategies for designing eco-efficient products based on a literature review. The proposed framework is based on the synergic use of Lean design, Eco-design, and Industry 4.0. It offers the right formula to deliver better and cleaner products using appropriate processes to support manufacturers in designing products, fulfilling customers' needs and expectations. It provides scholars, designers, and managers with valuable insights into deploying strategies to design sustainable products.

AB  - With the rapid evaluation of virtual and augmented reality, massive Internet of Things networks and upcoming 6 G communication give rise to an emerging concept termed the “metaverse,” which promises to revolutionize how we interact with the digital world by offering immersive experiences between reality and virtuality. Edge computing, another novel paradigm, propels the metaverse functionality by enhancing real-time interaction and reducing latency, providing a responsive and seamless virtual environment. However, realizing the full potential of the metaverse requires dynamic and efficient resource-allocation strategies to handle the immense demand for communicational, computational, and storage resources required by its diverse applications. This survey comprehensively explores resource-allocation strategies in the context of an edge-computing-enabled metaverse, investigating various challenges, existing techniques, and emerging trends in this rapidly expanding field. We first explore the underlying metaverse characteristics and pivotal role of edge computing, after which we investigate various types of resources and their key issues and challenges. We also provide a brief discussion on offloading and caching strategies, which are the most prominent research issues in this context. In this study, we compare and analyze 35 different resource-allocation strategies, benchmark 19 algorithms, and investigate their suitability across diverse metaverse scenarios, offering a broader scope than existing surveys. The survey aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners, helping them navigate the complexities of resource allocation in the metaverse and supporting the development of more efficient, scalable, and user-centric virtual environments.

AB  - In mechanically ventilated patients, some lung injuries can be reduced or avoided with therapy individualization, while the lung function is evaluated continuously, breath by breath. However, obtaining information on respiratory mechanics (respiratory system resistance and compliance) in the presence of respiratory effort is challenging, even if using invasive and complex procedures. The contribution of this work is to predict both respiratory system resistance and compliance over time using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and estimate the respiratory effort profile using the respiratory dynamics. Therefore, the approach used in this work was to generate a large amount of simulated data to feed a CNN so it could learn how to predict the correct values of the respiratory system resistance and compliance. Then, the respiratory effort was estimated by solving a first-order linear model. The main results showed a normalized mean squared error of 5.7% for the respiratory system resistance and 11.56% for compliance from Bland-Altman plots derived from the computational simulator. Finally, the method was validated using real data from an active lung simulator within which respiratory mechanics varied, and some ventilator settings were adjusted to mimic actual patient situations. The active lung simulator effort profile was obtained with a normalized mean squared error of 8.31% considering the use of an active lung simulator. The results have shown that the simulated data were valuable for the CNN training, while the performance over the real data suggested that the network was generalized accordingly for estimating respiratory parameters and effort profile.

AB  - Prompt thinking and quick reaction in complex dynamically changing traffic situations are determinant factors of road accidents. A key part of modern and promising intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) can be represented by VANET vehicular ad hoc network and its equivalents, whose nodes are represented by vehicles with installed special communication modules and new-generation intelligent on-board control systems. A concept of VANET network development is presented, which is based on biocybernetic systems of vehicle control and can serve as a starting point for building conceptually new ITSs and allow solving the primary ITS task at a totally new level, which lies in obtaining optimal prompt decisions (when driving a vehicle) in a short period of time, during which neither human no automated system can make a safe decision. We consider the architecture and basics of creating an intelligent on-board information-and-control module of a vehicle, based on the integration of a biocybernetic human-machine interface and elements of VANET vehicular ad hoc network. We also consider the basics of creating a bank of mathematical models as a central element of the intelligent on-board information-and-control module. Based on the analysis of completed experiments, we can conclude that the use of biocybernetic approaches based on sensor networks and corresponding applied vehicle control systems helps solving crucial traffic safety issues, namely: obtaining optimal prompt decisions (when driving a vehicle) in a short period of time, which significantly improves traffic safety and increases traffic intensity.

AB  - Advances in transcriptomic technologies have deepened our understanding of the cellular gene expression programs of multicellular organisms and provided a theoretical basis for disease diagnosis and therapy. However, both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches lose the spatial context of cells within the tissue microenvironment, and the development of spatial transcriptomics has made overall bias-free access to both transcriptional information and spatial information possible. Here, we elaborate development of spatial transcriptomic technologies to help researchers select the best-suited technology for their goals and integrate the vast amounts of data to facilitate data accessibility and availability. Then, we marshal various computational approaches to analyze spatial transcriptomic data for various purposes and describe the spatial multimodal omics and its potential for application in tumor tissue. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion and outlook of the spatial transcriptomic technologies, data resources and analysis approaches to guide current and future research on spatial transcriptomics.

AB  - The understanding of artifacts and biological phenomena has often influenced each other. This work argues that at the core of these epistemic bridges there are shared teleological notions and explanations manifested in analogies between artifacts and biological phenomena. To this end, I first propose a focus on the logical structure of minimal teleological explanations, which renders said epistemic bridges more evident than an ontological or metaphysical approach to teleology, and which can be used to describe scientific practices in different areas by virtue of formal generality and minimalism (section 2). Second, I show how this approach highlights some epistemic features shared by the understanding of artifacts and biological phenomena, like a specific kind of epistemic circularity, and how functional analogies between artifacts and biological phenomena translate such epistemic circularity from one domain to the other (section 3). Third, I conduct a case study on the scientific practice around the brain's “compass”, showing how the understanding of artifacts influences purpose ascription and measurement, and frames mechanisms in biology, especially in areas where purpose ascription is most difficult, like cognitive neuroscience (sections 4 and 5).

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine, as a complementary and alternative medicine, has been practiced for thousands of years in China and possesses remarkable clinical efficacy. Thus, systematic analysis and examination of the mechanistic links between Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and the complex human body can benefit contemporary understandings by carrying out qualitative and quantitative analysis. With increasing attention, the approach of network pharmacology has begun to unveil the mystery of CHM by constructing the heterogeneous network relationship of “herb-compound-target-pathway,” which corresponds to the holistic mechanisms of CHM. By integrating computational techniques into network pharmacology, the efficiency and accuracy of active compound screening and target fishing have been improved at an unprecedented pace. This review dissects the core innovations to the network pharmacology approach that were developed in the years since 2015 and highlights how this tool has been applied to understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 and refining the clinical use of CHM to combat it.

AB  - Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are an emerging class of regulatory RNAs of about 40–500 nucleotides in length and, by binding to their target mRNAs or proteins, get involved in many biological processes such as sensing environmental changes and regulating gene expression. Thus, identification of bacterial sRNAs and their targets has become an important part of sRNA biology. Current strategies for discovery of sRNAs and their targets usually involve bioinformatics prediction followed by experimental validation, emphasizing a key role for bioinformatics prediction. Here, therefore, we provided an overview on prediction methods, focusing on the merits and limitations of each class of models. Finally, we will present our thinking on developing related bioinformatics models in future.

AB  - Serious games present a relatively new approach to training and education for international organizations such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.

AB  - The advent of deepfake technology has introduced complex challenges to the information technology landscape, simultaneously presenting benefits and novel risks and ethical considerations. This paper delves into the evolution of deepfakes through the prism of information poverty theory, scrutinising how deepfakes may contribute to a growing information access/use inequality. The research focuses on the risks of misinformation and the ensuing expansion of digital divides, particularly when manipulative media could delude individuals lacking access to legitimate information sources. The study outlines the potential exacerbation of information asymmetries and examines the societal implications across various demographics. By integrating an analytical discussion on the risks associated with deepfakes, the study aligns the observed trends with the theoretical underpinnings of information poverty. As part of its contribution, the paper offers actionable policy-making recommendations and educational strategies to combat the proliferation of harmful deepfake content. The article aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of authentic information and foster media literacy. Through a multifaceted approach, this study endeavours to provide a foundational understanding for stakeholders to navigate the ethical minefield posed by deepfakes and to instil a framework for information equity in the digital era. The article provides critical insights into the discourse on deepfake technology and its relation to information poverty, underscoring the urgent need for equitable access to informed digital spaces. As deepfake technology evolves and more data emerges, a societal demand exists for comprehensive knowledge about deepfakes to promote discernment, decision-making and awareness. Policymakers are tasked with recognising the significance of widening access to sophisticated information technologies whilst addressing their negative repercussions. Their efforts will be particularly crucial for disseminating knowledge about deepfakes to those with limited or non-existent information and communication awareness and infrastructures. Learning from past successes and failures becomes pivotal in shaping effective strategies to address the challenges posed by deepfakes and fostering accessible, informed digital communities.

AB  - Differentiation generally considers the accumulation of genetic differences between populations or species but can be applied more broadly to the diversification of genes, organisms, and populations. This article examines how elementary evolutionary and ecological processes lead to differentiation in both the narrow and broad senses and introduces successively more complex processes involved in differentiation. Most mutations are selectively neutral and neutral evolution can be considered the default process of genomic change, with natural selection being measurable from changes in allele frequencies that lead to deviation from neutrality. While the basic tenets of genetic differentiation are well established, the advent of new genomic technologies and associated computational tools have provided unprecedented insights into the mechanism of genetic differentiation and how these might lead to the formation of species. Recent work has highlighted in particular the importance of genetic admixture events and genomic interactions in shaping the process of differentiation.

For example, the sliding filament theory of muscle, which is now widely leveraged in biomechanics research, stemmed from observations made possible by scanning electron microscopy. Over the last 50 years, advancing in medical imaging, combined with ingenuity and creativity of biomechanists, have provide a wealth of new and important insights into in vivo human muscle function. Incorporation of in vivo imaging has also advanced computational modeling and allowed our research to have an impact in many clinical populations. While this review does not provide a comprehensive or meta-analysis of the all the in vivo muscle imaging work over the last five decades, it provides a narrative about the past, present, and future of in vivo muscle imaging.

AB  - In order to further improve the performance of emotion neural network (ENN), a novel adaptive hormone regulation emotion neural network (HRENN) is proposed, which is based on the improved triple competitive swarm optimization (ITCSO) algorithm and grey correlation contribution. Firstly, the structure of HRENN is designed that is inspired by the biological mechanism of hormone regulation. The fast response characteristic of emotion processing and the feedback effect of hormone regulation can effectively improve the learning ability of HRENN. Secondly, the ITCSO algorithm is proposed for optimizing the parameters of HRENN. In order to strike a well balance between exploration and exploitation, triple competition mechanism is adopted. Two-thirds of particles participate in the optimization and different learning strategies for different particles are provided. These operations can greatly improve the optimization efficiency and the convergence accuracy. Moreover, grey correlation contribution is used to add or delete the dimension of particles. It means that the structure and parameters of HRENN can be adjusted simultaneously and the compact structure can be obtained. Finally, the stability and the convergence of ITCSO are proved using the Banach space and the principle of compression mapping. Experiment results show that the proposed ITCSO-HRENN has good self-organization ability, compact network structure, high convergence accuracy and superior computation efficiency compared with other methods.

AB  - Big data has caused the scientific community to re-examine the scientific research methodologies and has triggered a revolution in scientific thinking. As a branch of scientific research, production safety management is also exploring methods to take advantage of big data. This research aims to provide a theoretical basis for promoting the application of big data in production safety management. First, four different types of production safety management paradigms were identified, namely small-data-based, static-oriented, interpretation-based and causal-oriented paradigm, and the challenges to these paradigms in the presence of big data were introduced. Second, the opportunities of employing big data in production safety management were identified from four aspects, including better predict the future production safety phenomena, promote production safety management highlight relevance, achieve the balance between deductive and inductive approaches and promote the interdisciplinary development of production safety management. Third, the paradigm shifting trend of production safety management was concluded, and the discipline foundation of the new paradigm was considered as the integration of data science, production management and safety science. Fourth, a new big-data-driven production safety management paradigm was developed, which consists of the logical line of production safety management, the macro-meso-micro data spectrum, the key big data analytics, and the four-dimensional morphology. At last, the strengths (e.g., supporting better-informed safety description, safety inquisition, safety prediction) and future research direction (e.g., theory research focuses on safety-related data mining/capturing/cleansing) of the new paradigm were discussed. The research results not only can provide theoretical and practical basis for big-data-driven production safety management, but also can offer advice to managerial consideration and scholarly investigation.

AB  - Process models describe the desired or observed behaviour of organisations. In stochastic process mining, computational analysis of trace data yields process models which describe process paths and their probability of execution. To understand the quality of these models, and to compare them, quantitative quality measures are used. This research investigates model comparison empirically, using stochastic process models built from real-life logs. The experimental design collects a large number of models generated randomly and using process discovery techniques. Twenty-five different metrics are taken on these models, using both existing process model metrics and new, exploratory ones. The results are analysed quantitatively, making particular use of principal component analysis. Based on this analysis, we suggest three stochastic process model dimensions: adhesion, relevance and simplicity. We also suggest possible metrics for these dimensions, and demonstrate their use on example models.

AB  - While structured as an autobiography, this memoir exemplifies ways in which classic contributions to cybernetics (e.g., by Wiener, McCulloch & Pitts, and von Neumann) have fed into a diversity of current research areas, including the mathematical theory of systems and computation, artificial intelligence and robotics, computational neuroscience, linguistics, and cognitive science. The challenges of brain theory receive special emphasis. Action-oriented perception and schema theory complement neural network modeling in analyzing cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. Comparative studies of frog, rat, monkey, ape and human not only deepen insights into the human brain but also ground an EvoDevoSocio view of “how the brain got language.” The rapprochement between neuroscience and architecture provides a recent challenge. The essay also assesses some of the social and theological implications of this broad perspective.

AB  - The physics of astrophysical jets can be divided into three regimes: (i) engine and launch (ii) propagation and collimation, (iii) dissipation and particle acceleration. Since astrophysical jets comprise a huge range of scales and phenomena, practicality dictates that most studies of jets intentionally or inadvertently focus on one of these regimes, and even therein, one body of work may be simply boundary condition for another. We first discuss long standing persistent mysteries that pertain the physics of each of these regimes, independent of the method used to study them. This discussion makes contact with frontiers of plasma astrophysics more generally. While observations theory, and simulations, and have long been the main tools of the trade, what about laboratory experiments? Jet related experiments have offered controlled studies of specific principles, physical processes, and benchmarks for numerical and theoretical calculations. We discuss what has been accomplished on these fronts. Although experiments have indeed helped us to understand certain processes, proof of principle concepts, and benchmarked codes, they have yet to solved an astrophysical jet mystery on their own. A challenge is that experimental tools used for jet-related experiments so far, are typically not machines originally designed for that purpose, or designed with specific astrophysical mysteries in mind. This presents an opportunity for a different way of thinking about the development of future platforms: start with the astrophysical mystery and build an experiment to address it.

AB  - The paper discusses an approach aimed at endowing a cognitive architecture with artificial creativity capabilities in order to make a humanoid able to dance in a pleasant manner. The robot associates movements to music perception creating an aesthetically valuable dance by using a Hidden Markov Model with a nonclassical approach. Two matrices mainly influence the model: a Transition matrix TM, and an Emission Matrix EM. The TM matrix rules the transition between two subsequent movements. The EM matrix constitutes the link between a set of movements and the perceived music features. In order to compute the EM matrix, we exploit a genetic algorithm approach. The approach makes use of two kinds of fitness functions. The first one is an internal evaluation fitness that allows the robot to autonomously learn the association between music and movements. The second one depends on the interaction with a human teacher, leading to the determination of different dance styles, which constitute the robot repertoire. The experimental part discusses the effects on the creativity of different distances to compute fitness.

AB  - Attention is a key element that allows us to enhance or decrease the cognitive processing of distinct stimuli, depending on their relevance. In this work we investigate the influence that alcohol exerts on attention focusing, modeling the coupling of reward and thalamocortical circuits. Computer simulations of the reward-attention circuit reflect the spiking behavior of each neuron in the network, under the presence or absence of alcohol. Each neuron in the neural networks that replicate such circuits is described by a carefully designed coupled system of nonlinear differential equations that details essential neurophysiological properties. The computational simulations highlight aspects of clinical inattention symptoms in the autism spectrum disorder. Our results indicate that alcohol may lead to distraction or lack of attentional focus. Also, the simulations suggest why people with ASD might relaxes enhanced attentional focus when exposed to alcohol.

AB  - Massive theoretical studies in clinical psychology have implicated the self in understanding internalizing disorders (i.e., anxiety and mood disorders), in which self-related tasks were frequently used to investigate internalizing psychopathology. As one of the most frequently seen internalizing disorder in primary care, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are characterized by inappropriate self-related processing such as negative self-referential thinking. However, relevant neural mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, participants underwent a self-related task which they were presented with several positive and negative trait words and were required to judge the extent to which these traits matched themselves when compared to their average peers. Aberrant brain activation and functional connectivity of GAD were detected during processing positive and negative traits. Compared to healthy controls (HCs), patients with GAD exhibited abnormal self-processing which manifested as lower biased self-rating scores particularly for negative traits and weaker brain activity in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal sulcus (STS), and bilateral lingual gyrus when processing trait words. Abnormal functional connections between these hypoactive regions and regions associated with reward, emotion, and theory of mind were observed in subsequent psychophysiological interaction analysis. An attenuation of connectivity between the left insula and left STS was associated with greater severity of anxiety symptom in GAD patients. These findings provide insight into the abnormal neurocognitive mechanisms of biased self-related processing in GAD patients, which involves distorted self-schema accompanied by abnormal activation and functional connections of regions implicated in self-related and social cognition processing.

AB  - Maintenance schedules are scheduled ahead of time and automatically based on the continuous monitoring of the equipment by statistical methods, thanks to artificial intelligence-enabled digital transformation and the best fit model based on Machine Management Index in a pedagogical system. One of the most important aspects of universities is the widespread use of machine learning methods to evaluate students' progress. Machine learning approaches are designed to speed up the learning process without sacrificing accuracy. The dynamics of teaching and learning have shifted since the introduction of modern technological tools. The educational system as a whole has changed and developed over time. These days, people can get an education outside of the classroom as well, thanks to the proliferation of online courses and resources. Everyone's professional life begins with their education. By analyzing past data, artificial intelligence methods can resolve existing problems. When applied properly, artificial intelligence can be a highly efficient method for solving problems with a predictable and repeatable solution space. The learner's personality can be predicted based on a number of factors using machine learning approaches. This article examines how AI may improve digital learning in education management systems to sustain the education ecosystem. AI in education improves student results, learning experiences, and administrative processes. This study discusses AI applications in education management systems and associated problems and opportunities. We also explore ethical issues and the roadmap for using AI to improve education. Educational institutions can provide individualized curriculum for students based on their unique personalities and areas of interest. Institutions of higher learning can benefit greatly from this instrument for personality prediction by recommending a course of study that will better prepare students to enter the field of their choice and achieve professional success.

AB  - The values of excess heat characterizing sets of 493 simple binary eutectic mixtures and 965 cocrystals were estimated under super cooled liquid condition. The application of a confusion matrix as a predictive analytical tool was applied for distinguishing between the two subsets. Among seven considered levels of computations the BP-TZVPD-FINE approach was found to be the most precise in terms of the lowest percentage of misclassified positive cases. Also much less computationally demanding AM1 and PM7 semiempirical quantum chemistry methods are likewise worth considering for estimation of the heat of mixing values. Despite intrinsic limitations of the approach of modeling miscibility in the solid state, based on components affinities in liquids under super cooled conditions, it is possible to define adequate criterions for classification of coformers pairs as simple binary eutectics or cocrystals. The predicted precision has been found as 12.8% what is quite accepted, bearing in mind simplicity of the approach. However, tuning theoretical screening to such precision implies the exclusion of many positive cases and this wastage exceeds 31% of cocrystals classified as false negatives.

Gujarat state in Western India exemplifies all challenges of an agrarian economy founded on groundwater overexploitation sustained over decades by perverse energy subsidies. Major consequences are: secular decline in groundwater levels, deterioration of groundwater quality, rising energy cost of pumping, soaring carbon footprint of agriculture and growing financial burden of energy subsidies. In 2009, Government of Gujarat asked the present author, an economist, to chair a Taskforce of senior hydro-geologists and civil engineers to develop and recommend a Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) strategy for the state. This paper summarizes the recommended strategy and its underlying logic. It also describes the imperfect fusion of socio-economic and hydro-geologic perspectives that occurred in course of the working of the Taskforce and highlights the need for trans-disciplinary perspectives on groundwater governance.

AB  - The operating state of insulators is directly related to the stability of power transmission line. The existing methods for insulator state recognition cannot achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, the self-blast state recognition of glass insulators is investigated by using an adaptive learning representation. To increase the adaptability of the network to different scales, we propose a solution based on multi-scale information throughout the entire process, beginning from a low-scale to high-scale subnetworks. The multi-scale information is aggregated in parallel way to take advantage of rich information representation. Then, an imitation of the human thinking pattern is employed. Utilizing entropy-based cost function, we update the parameters of the learner model in real-time. Based on the constraint of the evaluation index, adaptive depth representation for training glass insulators that are unsatisfied with the reliability evaluation is constructed to realize the self-optimizing regulation of feature space. Correspondingly, a stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) classifier is re-constructed to fit for the update multi-hierarchies knowledge space to carry out the re-recognition process. Finally, fuzzy integration is employed to ensemble multi-hierarchies network to improve the model’s generalization. The recognition results on aerial dataset of insulators images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

The two fields might be fruitfully integrated, however, if social neuroscientists sought evidence directly relevant to current accounts of ToM development: modularity, simulation, executive, and theory theory accounts. Here we extend the distinct predictions made by each theory to the neural level, describe neuroimaging evidence that in principle would be relevant to testing each account, and discuss such evidence where it exists. We propose that it would be mutually beneficial for both fields if ToM neuroimaging studies focused more on integrating developmental accounts of ToM acquisition with neuroimaging approaches, and suggest ways this might be achieved.

AB  - The water conservancy framework is a significant foundation for China's financial and social turn of events. Simultaneously monetary and social turn of events, likewise tremendously affect the biological climate. In the prediction method of the environmental pollution hazard index of water conservancy projects, a risk assessment must be carried out to enhance its applicability. This article mainly focuses on traditional mathematical prediction models and combines the characteristics of fuzzy logic mathematics (good nonlinear quality) to establish a new combination prediction method. By comparing the convergence errors of traditional methods with this method, the results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively reduce prediction errors with fewer iterations, making it stable at around 500 times, with good convergence and high computational accuracy. The fuzzy logic-based prediction method for environmental pollution hazards in water conservancy systems proposed in this article can overcome the difficulty of nonlinear combination prediction. This achieves real-time prediction of environmental pollution hazards in water conservancy systems and shortens response time, greatly improving the accuracy of prediction.

AB  - Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) are pervasive groups of technologies expected to enable innovation. They have been promoted as technologies with tremendous potential for boosting economic growth and sustainability in all sectors of society – a claim whose validity remains underexplored. Building on systems thinking and the Multi-Level Perspective, we develop a novel approach to assess the socio-technical impact of a KET regime on a transitioning sectoral regime. This approach is applied to the case of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) KET impacting the decarbonization of the energy-intensive steel industry. To assess AI's technical impact, we compiled an inventory of AI tools based on reviewing technical scientific articles. Our analysis shows that AI adds technological value to the full range of areas in the steel industry, like predicting process parameters; optimizing operations, scheduling, and electrical energy; and forecasting product demand, quality, and site emissions. Semi-structured interviews were the primary data source to assess AI's broader socio-institutional impact. The results indicate that AI may currently be reinforcing path dependencies of the steel industry, as AI tools are more focused on incremental improvement for existing technologies rather than novel low-carbon technologies. However, AI also offers capabilities to reduce barriers to sustainability innovation, like system integration challenges, flexibility challenges, demand-side barriers, and risk-related barriers. Finally, we reflect on the generalizability of our approach for studying other transitions, and we induce characteristics of the AI-Digital KET regimes. We find that through these characteristics, the AI-Digital KET regime alters existing and creates new system structures (actors, networks, and institutions) within the impacted sector.
