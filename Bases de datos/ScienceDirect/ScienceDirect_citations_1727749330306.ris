AB  - To better understand the challenges of generally implementing and adapting computational phenotyping approaches, the performance of a Phenotype KnowledgeBase (PheKB) algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was evaluated on a University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) patient population, focusing on examining its performance on ambiguous cases. The algorithm was evaluated on a cohort of 4,766 patients, along with a chart review of 300 patients by rheumatologists against accepted diagnostic guidelines. The performance revealed low sensitivity towards specific subtypes of positive RA cases, which suggests revisions in features used for phenotyping. A close examination of select cases also indicated a significant portion of patients with missing data, drawing attention to the need to consider data integrity as an integral part of phenotyping pipelines, as well as issues around the usability of various codes for distinguishing cases. We use patterns in the PheKB algorithm’s errors to further demonstrate important considerations when designing a phenotyping algorithm.

AB  - The attractiveness of the coasts tends to increase their exposure to erosion and marine flooding risks. This exposure is exacerbated by the effects of climate change, in particular sea level rise. To contribute to strategic thinking on the vulnerability of coastal areas, it is essential to develop, share and collectively maintain relevant knowledge on risks. This article will present the thinking behind the setting up of a coastal risks observatory in Brittany, a region located in north-western France. It relies on a conceptual approach to systemic vulnerability based on four components: hazards, assets, management, and social representations. Hazards and assets underpin the notion of risk and tend to increase the vulnerability, management tends to mitigate it, and representations can play a part in increasing or decreasing it depending on the context. To understand and analyse this system of vulnerability, our approach is based on the generation of a set of 62 indicators combined into different types of indices. A web-GIS interface was developed to navigate through and map this system of vulnerability. The difficulties associated with this type of synthetic approach will be discussed, whether they are related to data availability, to the links between scientific research and operational territorial management requirements, or to an understanding of the dynamics of all of the vulnerability components and their interactions. Ultimately, the approach developed has been successful in mobilising scientific and operational stakeholders around the co-construction of a diagnosis of territories with regard to their vulnerability to coastal risks.

AB  - In school, at least in the US, we were taught to multiply by hand according to a standard algorithm. Most people find that algorithm difficult to use, and many children fail to learn it. We propose a new way to make sense of this difficulty: to treat explicit computation as perceptually supported physical and mental action. Based on recent work in neuroscience, we trace the flow of arithmetic information to emphasize demands on visual working memory and attention. We predict that algorithms that make moderate demands on memory and attention will work better than others that make stronger demands. We suggest that the judicious use of spatial schemas can reduce such cognitive demands. Experimental evidence from children in an inner-city school supports this claim. Our work suggests new ways to think about instruction. The goal should be to minimize demands that present obstacles and maximize instead what human eyes, bodies, and brains do well.

AB  - In the present work we revisit the shock wave dynamics in a granular chain with precompression. By approximating the model by an α-Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou chain, we leverage the connection of the latter in the strain variable formulation to two separate integrable models, one continuum, namely the KdV equation, and one discrete, namely the Toda lattice. We bring to bear the Whitham modulation theory analysis of such integrable systems and the analytical approximation of their dispersive shock waves in order to provide, through the lens of the reductive connection to the granular crystal, an approximation to the shock wave of the granular problem. A detailed numerical comparison of the original granular chain and its approximate integrable-system-based dispersive shocks proves very favorable in a wide parametric range. The gradual deviations between (approximate) theory and numerical computation, as amplitude parameters of the solution increase are quantified and discussed.

AB  - Despite proportional information being ubiquitous, there is not a standard account of proportional reasoning. Part of the difficulty is that there are several apparent contradictions: in some contexts, proportion is easy and privileged, while in others it is difficult and ignored. One possibility is that although we see similarities across tasks requiring proportional reasoning, people approach them with different strategies. We test this hypothesis by implementing strategies computationally and quantitatively comparing them with Bayesian tools, using data from continuous (e.g., pie chart) and discrete (e.g., dots) stimuli and preschoolers, 2nd and 5th graders, and adults. Overall, people's comparisons of highly regular and continuous proportion are better fit by proportion strategy models, but comparisons of discrete proportion are better fit by a numerator comparison model. These systematic differences in strategies suggest that there is not a single, simple explanation for behavior in terms of success or failure, but rather a variety of possible strategies that may be chosen in different contexts.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the neural correlates underlying the effects of idea evaluation on idea generation in creative thinking. Participants were required to generate original uses of conventional objects (alternative uses task) during EEG recording. A reflection task (mentally evaluating the generated ideas) or a distraction task (object characteristics task) was inserted into the course of idea generation. Behavioral results revealed that participants generated ideas with higher originality after evaluating the generated ideas than after performing the distraction task. The EEG results revealed that idea evaluation was accompanied with upper alpha (10–13Hz) synchronization, most prominent at frontal cortical sites. Moreover, upper alpha activity in frontal cortices during idea generation was enhanced after idea evaluation. These findings indicate that idea evaluation may elicit a state of heightened internal attention or top-down activity that facilitates efficient retrieval and integration of internal memory representations.

AB  - Because it is generally believed that the personality and temperament of a human driver influence his/her behavior on the road, the article presents a computational model of the temperament of an autonomous agent - a driver. First, a short review of the four ideas of Galen’s temperament in psychology is presented. Temperament traits are grouped into four other sets, one of which is chosen for implementation in the project of integration of the temperament model with the target autonomous agent. On the basis of this selection, it is proposed to modify, by introducing additional useful mechanisms of temperament, the existing model (ISD) of an autonomous robot and/or driver. In addition, other ways of extending the ISD model are indicated, as well as possible applications of the proposed system. The developed model may also be interesting for other research purposes in which the description of the human personality is important.

AB  - In this study, we rigorously assess the performance of three gradient-free optimization algorithms—Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA)—for estimating source terms in diverse radionuclide release scenarios. Our analysis encompasses both single and multiple sources with varying radionuclide compositions, delving into the influence of decay constants and radioactivity on source estimation accuracy. Although estimating a single radionuclide from a single source exhibits outstanding results, estimating multiple radionuclides from a single source proves more arduous due to the limited information available for discerning gamma dose rates. Contrary to expectations, increasing the number of observation stations does not consistently improve the likelihood of finding accurate solutions in ill-posed inverse problems. Impressively, under our simulation settings, EKI demonstrates competitive performance in terms of convergence, accuracy, and runtime compared to PSO and GA, with GPU parallelization further bolstering computational efficiency. We explore strategies for enhancing source term estimation, including incorporating prior information, applying uncertainty removal techniques, and optimizing observation placement. Additionally, this study underscores the intricate role of relative error in determining multi-radionuclide estimation accuracy from gamma dose measurements. By employing the Gaussian plume model under steady-state conditions, our research lays the groundwork for future applications of Lagrangian dispersion models with real-time data integration. The insights gleaned from our study promise to advance environmental radioactivity monitoring and catalyze the development of cutting-edge, real-time source estimation technologies in full-scale systems.

AB  - Developing affordable and scalable energy storage solutions are essential to decarbonizing power systems. The conversion of renewable electricity into chemical energy carriers such as ammonia has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. Many Power-to-Ammonia (PtA) plants have been conceptualized and developed worldwide in recent years. The PtA plant is an integration of multiple electrochemical processes, each with a distinct set of operational constraints and cost structure. One of the problems in the operation of PtA plants is the optimal scheduling of the hydrogen buffer in PtA plants considering the operational characteristics of electrochemical processes and the volatility and uncertainty of electricity prices. In this paper, a two-stage Markov-Decision-Process (MDP) approach is proposed. The computational challenges brought by the infinite optimization horizon and non-concavity of cost functions are resolved. The first stage solution is based on the periodic MDP approach, which captures the periodic structure of electricity prices. The second stage solution gives optimal real-time decisions based on a rolling-horizon MDP approach. Numerical results show that the accurate representations of the cost functions and the optimization horizon using the proposed method are necessary, while the linearization of cost functions and the truncation of the optimization horizon lead to notable deviations from the optimality.

AB  - Inspired by the structure and principles of the human brain, spike neural networks (SNNs) appear as the latest generation of artificial neural networks, attracting significant and universal attention due to their remarkable low-energy transmission by pulse and powerful capability for large-scale parallel computation. Current research on artificial neural networks gradually change from software simulation into hardware implementation. However, such a process is fraught with challenges. In particular, memristors are highly anticipated hardware candidates owing to their fast-programming speed, low power consumption, and compatibility with the complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this review, we start from the basic principles of SNNs, and then introduced memristor-based technologies for hardware implementation of SNNs, and further discuss the feasibility of integrating customized algorithm optimization to promote efficient and energy-saving SNN hardware systems. Finally, based on the existing memristor technology, we summarize the current problems and challenges in this field.

AB  - Informed citizens are expected to use science-based evidence to make decisions about health, behavior and public policy. To do so, they must judge whether the evidence is consistent with the claims presented (theory-evidence coordination). Unfortunately, most individuals make numerous errors in theory-evidence coordination. In this chapter, we provide an overview of research on science evidence evaluation, drawing from research in cognitive and developmental psychology, science and statistics education, decision sciences, political science and science communication. Given the breadth of this research area, we highlight some influential studies and reviews across these different topics. This body of research provides several clues about: (1) why science evidence evaluation is challenging, (2) the influence of the content and context of the evidence and (3) how the characteristics of the individual examining the evidence impact the quality of the evaluations. Finally, we suggest some possible directions for empirical research on improving evidence evaluation and point to the responsibility of scientists, especially social and behavioral scientists, in communicating their findings to the public. Overall, our goal is to give readers an interdisciplinary view of science evidence evaluation research and to integrate research from different scientific communities that address similar questions.

AB  - Large sources of digital trace data (i.e. “Big Data”) have become increasingly important in the study of material culture. However, akin to the offline material culture traditionally studied by archaeologists, digital trace data is rarely a passive reflection of human behavior – it is a complex palimpsest produced through a variety of erasure and accretion formation processes. To better understand how digital trace palimpsests are formed and how digital formation processes influence and inform our ability to interpret the offline material processes they index, we introduce a computational method – high-frequency archaeological survey – which allows us to observe digital formation processes at a high temporal resolution, as well as a large spatial scale. Using this method every hour for one month, we surveyed posts from across the United States in Craigslist's “Free Stuff” category (popularly called “Curb Alert”), a user-generated source of big digital trace data, indexing material things that have been placed on users' curbs for removal by scavengers or trash collectors. For each post, we observed its time-to-erasure and any edits that were made during the study period – finding that the posts that survive represent a biased sample of those that were posted over the course of the month, conditioned by how recently and on what day the post is posted, the material characteristics of things that are posted about, as well as regional variation. Far from only being evidence of biased end-of-month data, however, we show that further analysis of identified digital formation processes can be an important object of study in its own right – in this case, shedding new light on social scientific questions linking the exchange of “free stuff” with the process of social stratification and urban inequality in the United States. Overall, our findings suggest the importance of accounting for and explicitly analyzing digital formation processes in studies that utilize digital trace data.

The aim of this survey is threefold: (1) we present the results of a network-based analysis of the existing multidisciplinary literature to support the search for relevant trends and central publications; (2) we describe the main results and necessary background to attack the problem under a computational perspective; (3) we review selected contributions using network science as a unifying framework and computational linguistics as the tool to make sense of the shared content. Despite scholars working on computational linguistics and networks traditionally belong to different scientific communities, we expect that those interested in the area of fake news should be aware of crucial aspects of both disciplines.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The chapter deals with the description of Fussy Logic (FL) principles and its application in power electronics and motor-drive systems. The FL is a discipline under Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is basically computer emulation of human thinking (called computational intelligence). The goal of AI is to mimic human intelligence. AI also includes expert systems (ESs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), or neural networks (NNWs), and genetic algorithms (GAs). All of the main areas in AI, except ES, are defined as soft computing. The concept of FL and its characteristics emerge from Zadeh's theory propounded in 1965. Any FL application uses a knowledge base that consists of multivalued membership functions (MFs) describing the fuzzy variables and the rule table consisting of “IF… THEN… statements.” The knowledge base is developed on the basis of the behavioral nature of the system. The trial-and-error approach of FL algorithms may be time consuming, but user-friendly computer programs (such as the MATLAB-based Fuzzy Logic Toolbox) help speed the process. The applications of FL principles, include speed control of induction motor vector drives, efficiency optimization of induction motor vector drives by flux programming; and wind generation systems, linearization of the transfer characteristics of thyristor converters at discontinuous conduction, induction motor stator resistance estimations, estimation of distorted waveforms and MRAC slip gain tuning control of vector drives.

AB  - Students' demand for online learning has exploded during the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. However, due to their poor learning experience, students' dropout rate and learning performance of online learning are not always satisfactory. The technical advantages of Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) can guarantee a good multimedia Quality of Experience (QoE). As a special case of multimedia services, online learning takes into account both the usability of the service and the cognitive development of the users. Factors that affect the Quality of Online Learning Experience (OL-QoE) become more complicated. To get over this dilemma, we propose a systematic scheme by integrating big data, Machine Learning (ML) technologies, and educational psychology theory. Specifically, we first formulate a general definition of OL-QoE by data analysis and experimental verification. This formula considers both the subjective and objective factors (i.e., video watching ratio and test scores) that most affect OL-QoE. Then, we induce an extended layer to the classic Broad Learning System (BLS) to construct an Extended Broad Learning System (EBLS) for the students' OL-QoE prediction. Since the extended layer can increase the width of the BLS model and reduce the redundant nodes of BLS, the proposed EBLS can achieve a trade-off between the prediction accuracy and computation complexity. Finally, we provide a series of early intervention suggestions for different types of students according to their predicted OL-QoE values. Through timely interventions, their OL-QoE and learning performance can be improved. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB  - Single-cell multi-omics is a rapidly evolving field, thanks to a fast technological improvement and the growing accuracy of dedicated computational tools for data analysis. Its importance is highlighted by the possibility to distinguish apparently identical cells based on their pattern of gene expression. In this review, the mostly used methodological pipelines for single-cell analysis, as well as the advantages and potential limitations of several analytical steps, are presented and discussed, with specific sections focusing on crucial parts of this procedure, their bioinformatic tools, as well as their advantages and potential drawbacks. The current bioinformatic approaches for T-cell receptor (TCR) reconstruction are also introduced, as well as a comparison of single-cell sequencing technologies. Critical points that may introduce analytical biases and potential inaccuracies in data interpretation are also highlighted.

AB  - The assessment of nanocomposite mechanical properties is a challenging task. Due to their hierarchical structure, which spans from nano to macro length-scales, a different way of thinking from traditional approaches is needed to account for the characteristic phenomena of each length-scale and bridge their effects from the smaller scale to the macroscale. In the present work, some important issues of nanocomposite modelling are discussed. Then, a classification of the available modelling strategies is proposed, according to the scale from which the problem is addressed. This comprehensive analysis is thought as a necessary tool for the development of new effective approaches.

AB  - Society is increasingly digitalised and connected, with computers and algorithms mediating much of people’s daily activity in one way or another. The degree of digitalisation and its consequences are challenging to understand because most people lack first-hand experience of what digitalisation actually feels like. Digitalisation is abstract and difficult to grasp, which leads to a detached sense of the digital surroundings. In this paper, we argue that in order to grasp the nature and future of a digitalised society, an embodied understanding of digitalisation is needed. Such an understanding should utilise ways of knowing other than rational thinking, challenge existing narratives and move from preparing for the future to exploring novelty. We focus on the importance of a broader understanding of digitalisation within the field of education and discuss how a more diverse view is essential to empower people to take part in a digitalised society. We use the concept of ‘digi-grasping’ to analyse awareness and involvement in the digital world. By digi-grasping we mean active sense-making and existing in a world that consists of both a digital and a physical world. We argue that through ‘grasping’ the digital world it is possible to create an ethical and aesthetic attachment to society. Digi-grasping can empower people to understand and question the choices and motivations behind current digital structures and create new structures. It is thus an important approach to shaping the futures of digital society. We illustrate the concept with examples representing different modes of being and doing at the interface of the digital and physical.

AB  - Although humor enriches human lives, some jokes fail to amuse people because of a lack of morality. In this paper, we propose a mechanism capable of selecting humor based on moral criteria. To this end, we first construct a model based on an N-gram corpus and generate joke candidates using various template patterns. We then employ a moral judgement classifier based on a recurrent neural network and utilize the trained model for humor selection. The experimental results obtained from best–worst scaling demonstrate that this scheme is able to generate jokes with moral category labels. We confirmed that jokes about the classifier categorized as Loyalty and Authority, which are regarded as good in our study, are funnier than jokes about Fairness, Purity, Harm, Cheating, and Degradation. Although we did not confirm that there was a difference in the funny level between good and bad moral jokes, the results demonstrate that moral categories of humor can affect the funny level.

AB  - In this paper, we employ the language ontologies framework to artificial intelligence (specifically, OpenAI's ChatGPT) to investigate the ‘ethnographic encounter’ between human and non-human language users. Our focus is on the exchange and interplay between human language users and non-human artificial language generators in the production of written text. We analyse how such programs transform our understanding of what language is or might be; their practices to create language are unfamiliar, and yet they make sense to human interlocutors. Drawing from, and building on, the language ontologies framework, we discuss the practices involved in such encounters and suggest the need for an updated ‘toolkit’ in our understanding of language to account for transhuman interactions.

AB  - Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs) are extreme explosions driven by nonlinear physical processes associated with explosively expanded vapour and flashed liquid. Blast loading generated from BLEVEs may severely harm structures and people. Prediction of such strong explosions is not currently feasible using simple tools. Physics-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods are commonly utilized to predict the blast loading of BLEVE by going through many empirical formulas that map input variables to the target progressively. The calculation is often time-consuming, and it is therefore impractical to apply these methods to predict explosion loads from BLEVE in normal design analysis. Thinking of the composition of empirical relations in CFD models as a complex and nonlinear function, it is necessary to find an approximation of this function that can be efficiently calculated. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a data-driven computational model that is capable of approximating any functions by learning from training data. Once properly trained, ANN can produce accurate predictions even for unseen inputs. This article presents the development of an ANN model to predict blast loading of BLEVEs in an open environment. A rigorous validation process is presented for the design of ANN structure, and the selected ANN is trained using validated simulation data from CFD models. Extensive evaluation of the network predictive performance is conducted, and it shows that the developed ANN can reproduce the result of CFD models effectively and efficiently, not only on simulation data but also on real experimental data. The prediction of ANN has a percentage error around 6 % and R2 value over 0.99 with the result of CFD simulated data. It speeds up the processing time from hours to seconds and only increases the error from 26.3 %–27.6 %, compared to the CFD simulations of real experimental data. Therefore, the developed ANN model can be potentially applied in the process engineering to generate a large number of reliable data for safety and risk assessment of BLEVEs in a more efficient way.

The five million pieces of taxis GPS data in Nanjing, China are analyzed: firstly, the data preprocessing is conducted for the reduction measuring error of GPS data with the expurgation of the static point, the drifting point, and the relatively independent point; then, the road intersections through the regional extreme points are found to restore map with the following three algorithms: the path selection algorithm based on probability, the improved Prim path selection algorithm, and the improved Prim path selection algorithm based on probability; at last, the SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm) is applied to the measurement of the road map gained from the previous three algorithms for optimal path planning with 40 pairs of starting points and termination points, and making a comparison of the road length among three methods. Through the experimental comparison, the third method namely the improved Prim path selection algorithm based on probability which proved to be more optimal than others two methods produces an efficient driving route more accurately.

AB  - This paper looks at innovation ecosystems through the lens of complexity science, considering them as open non-linear entities that are characterized by changing multi-faceted motivations of networked actors, high receptivity to feedback, and persistent structural transformations. In the context of the growing organizational complexity of economies, driven by their adaptation to high uncertainty, and the central role of collaboration, we differentiate the innovation capacity of various types of business networks by the complexity of their internal interactions, thus identifying the place of innovation ecosystems in the world of business networks, as well as the place of innovation clusters among other innovation ecosystems. We observe how innovation ecosystems have been viewed in four different research streams: management literature; the inter-firm and business network stream of economic and sociological literature; the innovation policy and competitiveness agenda in economic literature; and the dichotomy of localized and economy-wide innovation ecosystems in policy studies (in economic literature, evolutionary geography, and regional research). We then describe generic properties of innovation ecosystems in terms of complexity science, viewing them as complex adaptive systems, paying special attention to the complexity of innovation clusters. We compare complexity thinking of modern economies, deriving from their emerging ecosystem design, with traditional thinking conceived for industrial era, drawing insights for a better transition to innovation-led growth. We conclude with a summary of key findings, practical and policy implications and recommendations for further study.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The most well-known indicators of cognitive functioning—intelligence and cognitive ability tests—do not assess a critical aspect of thinking, which is the ability to think rationally. To think rationally means adopting appropriate goals, taking the appropriate action given one's goals and beliefs, and holding beliefs that are commensurate with available evidence. Standard intelligence tests do not assess such functions. Although intelligence tests assess the ability to focus on an immediate goal in the face of distraction, they do not assess whether a person has the tendency to develop goals that are rational in the first place. Likewise, intelligence tests are good measures of how well a person can hold beliefs in short-term memory and manipulate those beliefs, but they do not assess whether a person has the tendency to form beliefs rationally when presented with evidence. Similarly, intelligence tests are good measures of how efficiently a person processes information that has been provided, but they do not assess whether the person is a critical assessor of information as it is gathered in the natural environment.

AB  - Building on previous work to define the scientific discipline of biomedical informatics, we present a framework that categorizes fundamental challenges into groups based on data, information, and knowledge, along with the transitions between these levels. We define each level and argue that the framework provides a basis for separating informatics problems from non-informatics problems, identifying fundamental challenges in biomedical informatics, and provides guidance regarding the search for general, reusable solutions to informatics problems. We distinguish between processing data (symbols) and processing meaning. Computational systems, that are the basis for modern information technology (IT), process data. In contrast, many important challenges in biomedicine, such as providing clinical decision support, require processing meaning, not data. Biomedical informatics is hard because of the fundamental mismatch between many biomedical problems and the capabilities of current technology.

Therefore, a well-structured framework supported by computational intelligence and optimization methods, environmental monitoring, and behavior modeling techniques, as well as comfort, productivity, and behavioral studies, are required to make optimal decisions for the indoor environment. In this paper, the main concepts, challenges, the latest studies, findings, and developments related to the six topics of (1) Occupant comfort conditions; (2) Occupant productivity; (3) Building control; (4) Computational optimization; (5) Occupant behavior modeling; (6) Environmental monitoring and analysis, in offices, commercial and residential buildings are reviewed.

AB  - Every person, from an early age, has to make decisions to resolve situations that arise in life. In general, different people make different decisions in the same situation, since decision-making takes into account different factors such as age, emotional state, experience, among others. We can make decisions about situations that we classify as: more important than others, routine, unexpected, or trivial. However, making the correct decision(s) in a timely manner for these situations is one of the most complex and delicate challenges that human beings face. This is due to the arduous mental process required to be carried out. Providing such behavior to a virtual entity is possible through the use of Cognitive Architectures (CAs). CAs are an approach for modeling human intelligence and behavior. This paper presents an functional bioinspired computational decision-making model to satisfy the physiological needs of hunger and thirst. Our proposal considers as black boxes other cognitive functions that are part of a general CA (named Cuäyöllötl or brain in Nahuatl). In the proposed case study, it is proved that the decision-making process plays an essential role in determining the objective and selecting the object that satisfies the established need.

AB  - Heat transfer regulation between engine components has a direct impact on engine efficiency and performance. Improving engine system efficiency, reducing emissions, and prolonging component life all depend on efficient heat management. This review looks at recent advancements in integrated heat transfer optimization to boost efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve engine system performance. This effort also investigates producing intricate heat transfer components with improved geometry using additive manufacturing techniques. With additive printing, designers may more easily construct complex structures and optimize heat transfer surfaces for better performance. The development of nanofluids and nanocoatings now allows for improving heat transfer qualities. Nanotechnology advancements have made this possible, and nanostructured materials' enhanced surface properties as well as thermal conductivity contribute to better heat dissipation in engine systems. The modern automotive and aerospace sectors have high standards, which are met through novel designs, materials, computational tools, and integrated cooling systems. Additionally, these improvements pave the way for more efficient and environmentally friendly engine operation. Because of the integration of computational technologies like numerical modeling and CFD, engineers can now see complex heat flow patterns and construct more efficient cooling solutions. Additive manufacturing has changed component manufacturing by enabling sophisticated designs that maximize heat transfer surfaces.

The advance is in establishing the mechanism for driving the dynamics of the sets and individuals.

AB  - Sports and exercise psychology finds itself in a most unfortunate situation these days. While all other branches of the psychological sciences help themselves freely to the glitzy new toys of modern neuroscience—MRI and PET, mostly—exploring the neural underpinnings of whatever cognitive function they are interested in exploring, the sport sciences are left out of the fun for the simple reason that these imaging instruments preclude motion—the very thing then that is the subject of interest to them. There are several legitimate ways around this problem but the one that seems to be most popular is, I think, not—legitimate, that is. The basic idea, unduly sharpened here, is the following. Neuroimaging studies have shown that imagined and actual motion share the same neural substrates or, alternatively, imagining an action corresponds to a subliminal activation of the same brain areas required for its execution. It follows from this, the arguments runs, that motor imagery can be used as a proxy for real motor performance, et voilà, the sports sciences can go wild with all the snazzy brain imaging tools after all—just like everyone else. This notion is, I believe, misbegotten, a house of cards that threatens to cast a long shadow over the field. The present article, then, is, to be frank, intended to put a machete to this kind of thinking. It does this by exposing this conclusion to be based on an unholy marriage of selective data reporting and gross overgeneralization. The result is a wild goose chase fueled by wishful thinking.

AB  - Co-creation is a well-established topic in manufacturing research. Since 1999 there has been a wide range of publications about the involvement of customers in the design of end products. What is new, however, is the stakeholder, particularly user, integration at the early stage of development of product-service systems (PSS) for concept co-creation. In this paper, we evaluate the methods for PSS development at the fuzzy front-end, before we derive a co-creation oriented method that relies on prototyping at selected stages of the process. The first stage deals with the generation of a shared understanding of the concept to be developed, and in the second stage we converge towards the generation of the user requirements by employing a set of electronic tools to drive process and logic flow thinking within the group of co-creators. The methodology has been evaluated within three workshops involving 42 participants who were asked to design a decentralized bike-sharing system, where bike owners can generate revenues from their bikes by renting them out when not otherwise needed. In a future phase, the results will be compared to the outcomes of a workshop organized with a bike sharing company that is currently developing this model.

AB  - This paper highlights the new horizons opening with the applications of concepts from the application of the complexity science to tourism data, which are traditionally treated from an intradisciplinar point of view. From this new point of view, tourism is considered as a complex adaptive system. Complexity theory is rooted in the hard sciences, and social sciences have adopted it in recent times. Going a step further, we introduce the concept of chaordic system in tourism. This new thinking has appeared in the social sciences as a response to the current need to cope with contradictions and inconsistencies, adapting evolution without losing essence. We propose considering tourism as a chaordic system and analyzing the resulting managerial consequences. We propose the use of a set of measures to quantify a system as chaordic. Finally, we empirically analyze tourist arrivals to Majorca (Spain) to verify the existence of a chaordic system.

AB  - The introduction of Lipinski's ‘Rule of Five’ has initiated a profound shift in the thinking paradigm of medicinal chemists. Understanding the difference between biologically active small molecules and drugs became a priority in the drug discovery process, and the importance of addressing pharmacokinetic properties early during lead optimization is a clear result. These concepts of ‘drug-likeness’ and ‘druggability’ have been extended to proteins and genes for target identification and selection. How should these concepts be integrated practically into the drug discovery process? This review summarizes the recent advances in the field and examines the usefulness of ‘the rules of the game’ in practice from a medicinal chemist's standpoint.

AB  - The wide application of multi-frequency atomic force microscopy (AFM) places higher demands on the higher-order modes response of the cantilever. The response of the higher modes however is generally weaker than that of the fundamental mode in air. Researchers have proposed many methods, most of which involve cantilever modification, to enhance higher-order eigenmodes response. These previous results are proved to be effective, but the microfabrication is expensive. In this article, we propose a novel model based on bridge/cantilever coupled system to enhance the higher-order modes response of AFM cantilever. The segmented beam model provides a new thinking to explain the appearance of undesired peaks in mode analysis of cantilever. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we find that higher resonance modes are enhanced by tuning the bridge to match the high resonances of the single clamped cantilever. The length, thickness of the coupled system and the location of excitation can affect the enhancement. In summary, this model provides a new way to improve higher mode response for multi-frequency and other high bandwidth applications of AFM.

AB  - A mobile agent is a self-learning machine entity that uses the system infrastructure to keep running in another remote zone, check and compile the results, interact with various locations and return to his home site after completing the relegated activities. Mobile Agent-based solutions for the testing community have grown in popularity and are now used in a variety of fields, including boardroom management, electronic commerce, renewable energy and power management. Addition to these applications, Broadband Interactive Sensors, network performance improvement, disseminated knowledge mining, multimedia, human monitoring, surveillance, affective computing, weather and environment, e-learning and semantic web administrations are only a few of the topics covered. In an extremely non trusty environment, focus should be taken to shield the portable operator from acquiring altered. Existing works on mobile agent frameworks with very surprising instruments does not offer complete security. In this paper a capture based trust dependence framework is proposed for identification of authorized or trust nodes inside mobile agents systems. Here we consider the mobile adhoc networks for computational analysis of network performance using network simulator. The framework provides efficient results in identification of authorized nodes.

AB  - In this paper, a formulation for the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Meeting Points (DARPmp) is introduced. The problem consists of defining routes that satisfy trip requests between pick-up and drop-off points while complying with time window, ride time, vehicle load, and route duration constraints. A set of meeting points is defined, and passengers may be asked to use these meeting points as alternative pickup or drop-off points if this results in routes with lower costs. Incorporating meeting points into the DARP is achieved by formulating a mixed-integer linear program. Two preprocessing steps and three valid inequalities are introduced, which improve the computational performance when solving the DARPmp to global optimality. Two versions of the Tabu Search metaheuristic are proposed to approximate the optimal solution in large-scale networks due to the NP-hardness of DARPmp. Performing numerical experiments with benchmark instances, this study demonstrates the benefits of DARPmp compared to DARP in terms of reducing vehicle running costs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide alterations that can be used as genomic markers disclosing susceptibility to complex diseases like AD. Epistasis has long been significant for recognizing the function of genetic pathways and the evolutionary dynamics of difficult genetic systems. Discovering epistasis interactions holds a vital key to personalized medicine (PM). PM needs a better understanding of the relationship between human genetic data and complex diseases. In this proposed work, a deep neural network (DNN) is applied using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to get top 20, 100, 300, and 500 ranking SNPs responsible for AD risk through epistasis interactions. Multi-locus interaction analysis is performed on these identified SNPs using Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR). This constructive induction algorithm is integrated with DNN for discovering epistasis interactions in a computationally effective method. The proposed framework is applied to Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The best accuracies are achieved using the top 500 SNPs, and the classification accuracies varied between 0.860 and 0.874 in the five-way interaction model. However, the classification accuracies of 2-way, 3-way, 4-way models varied between 0.663 and 0.670, 0.718 and 0.727, and 0.793 and 0.803, respectively. The results revealed that the reported accuracy scores of the proposed framework outperform the referenced literature work. The proposed framework presents high-ranked risk genes and promising epistasis interactions that may help in explaining the risk of AD.

AB  - Discrete event simulation (DES) is an important tool for the development and analysis of wireless networks. However, with increasing network size and complexity, the computational effort and simulation time increases significantly, often exponentially. This increase in response time may be critical if DES is interfacing real-time systems like Hardware in the Loop (HIL) or network emulation. It also slows down development cycles of users designing or debugging simulation models. Most popular DES software packages run single-threaded. Thus, they achieve only limited performance improvements from more modern multi-core CPUs. At the same time, existing approaches for parallel simulation of networks do not perform well on wireless systems or require complex paradigm shifts in simulation models. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Background Processing (ABP) to accelerate the simulation of wireless communication on multi-core systems. By moving expensive computation from the main thread into asynchronous tasks computed by background threads, it accelerates the progression of events and thus reduces response time. Tasks are started as early as possible to exploit the time the main thread spends processing other events, ideally providing results before they are needed in the simulation. We showcase the application of ABP using Veins, a popular vehicular network simulator, demonstrating speedups of up to 3.5 on typical desktop platforms. We further perform an in-depth analysis using advanced profiling techniques to investigate the effectiveness of the parallelization and guide further optimizations.

AB  - Since the discovery of cognitive maps in rodent hippocampus (HC), the cognitive map has evolved from originally referring to spatial representations encoding locations and objects in Euclidean spaces to a general low-dimensional organization of information along selected feature dimensions. A cognitive map includes hypothetical constructs that bridge between environmental stimuli and the final overt behavior. To neuroeconomists, utility and utility functions are such constructs with neurobiological basis that drive choice behavior. Emergence of distinct functional neuron groups in the primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during simple economic choice indicates the formation of an abstract cognitive map for organizing information of goods for value computation. Experimental evidence suggests that organization of neuronal activity in such cognitive map reflects the abstraction of core task features. Thus, such map can be adapted to accommodate economic choices under various task contexts.

I answer that the right questions are: What’s different between us and the other primates and what’s the same. I answer the what’s different question by saying that we became symbolic in a way that enabled story understanding, directed perception, and easy communication, and other species did not. I argue against Turing’s reasoning-centered suggestions, offering that reasoning is just a special case of story understanding. I answer the what’s the same question by noting that our brains are largely engineered in the same exotic way, with information flowing in all directions at once. By way of example, I illustrate how these answers can influence a research program, describing the Genesis system, a system that works with short summaries of stories, provided in English, together with low-level common-sense rules and higher-level concept patterns, likewise expressed in English. Genesis answers questions, notes abstract concepts such as revenge, tells stories in a listener-aware way, and fills in story gaps using precedents. I conclude by suggesting, optimistically, that a genuine computational theory of human intelligence will emerge in the next 50years if we stick to the right, biologically inspired questions, and work toward biologically informed models.

AB  - The human cerebellum, though relatively small in total volume, makes up for it in its neuronal density and immense computational power. As we seek to understand complex higher order human behavior, it is critical to consider how this structure may contribute to these domains. While historically conceptualized as a motor structure, likely in large part due to the overt motor deficits often experienced by those with cerebellar damage, it is now known to play a critical role in cognition. In the last decade in particular there has been a great deal of growth in the literature in this regard (though these ideas have been percolating since the 1980s). The development of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) also resulted in a boom of literature seeking to clarify cerebellar interactions with the cortex. In this chapter, cerebellar anatomy and function are reviewed, with a particular focus on how fcMRI has impacted our understanding of the human cerebellum and what this has meant for our accounts of cerebellar processing (that is, the underlying computations). This work has broadened our appreciation of the cerebellum's networks linked to higher order processing, and resulted in thought provoking findings with respect to the functional organization of the cerebellum that may in the future impact our understanding of how the “little brain” helps the cortex produce nuanced and complicated human behavior.

AB  - Liquid phase oxidation of furfural using hydrogen peroxide offers a promising route for bio-based C4 furanones and diacids; however, only dilute water-based process designs have been previously suggested that have limited techno-economic potential. In this study, a conceptual process design is presented, where aqueous furfural is extracted using an organic solvent, coupled with peroxide oxidation and product recovery in the presence of the solvent. To address the problem of solvent selection, the COSMO-RS-based solvent screening framework is applied, where quantum mechanics-based thermodynamics are utilized in pinch-based process models. About 2500 solvent candidates were identified as feasible. Focusing on a set of 400 solvent candidates revealed energy consumption values (Qreb,tot/ṁprod recov) between approximately 2 MWh/tonne and 33 MWh/tonne, signifying the potential of the solvent-based process in outperforming the reference aqueous process (49.4 MWh/tonne). The study provides potential solvent candidates and future directions to consider in more costly computational and experimental efforts.

AB  - Advance knowledge of conflicting trajectories of water–energy–food (WEF) nexus is highly relevant for water policy and planning, especially for basins that cross national boundaries. The Brahmaputra River Basin in South Asia, home for 130 million people, is such a basin. Development of new hydropower projects, upstream water diversions and possible climate changes introduce concerns among riparian countries about future water supply for energy and food production in the basin. This study presents a new hydro-economic water system model of the basin coupled with ex post scenario analysis under the “nexus thinking” concept to identify and illustrate where development paths are in conflict. Results indicate that the ability of future development to remain free of conflict hinges mostly on the amount of precipitation falling in the basin in the future. Uncertain future precipitation along with uncertain future temperature and the unknown amount of upstream water diversion combine to strongly influence future water, energy and food production in the basin. Specifically, decreases in precipitation coupled with large upstream diversions (e.g., diversion in the territory of China) would leave one or more riparian countries unable to secure enough water to produce their desired energy and food. Future climate projected by General Circulation Models suggest a warmer and wetter climate condition in the region, which is associated with an increase in streamflow and easing of conflicts at the WEF nexus in the basin. The methodology presented here is expected to be generally useful for diagnosing the conditions that may cause water resources development goals to not be achieved due to either changes in climate or water use among competing users.

AB  - The neural basis involved in novel metaphor comprehension in schizophrenia is relatively unknown. Fourteen people with schizophrenia and fourteen controls were scanned while they silently read novel metaphors, conventional metaphors, literal expressions, and meaningless word-pairs. People with schizophrenia showed reduced comprehension of both novel and conventional metaphors. Furthermore, while controls showed enhanced brain activation in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for novel metaphors versus meaningless word-pairs, people with schizophrenia showed an over-activation of left IFG and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Direct comparison between the groups revealed greater activation in left precuneus for both novel metaphors and literal expressions vs. baseline for individuals with schizophrenia. Direct comparison for novel metaphors vs. literal expressions also revealed increased activation for individuals with schizophrenia in left MFG. These results suggest that the inefficient processing of novel metaphors in schizophrenia involves compensatory recruitment of additional brain regions that include the left MFG and left precuneus.

AB  - Interacting with complex and dynamic environments challenges the brain’s ability to adapt to change. This key ability known as cognitive flexibility involves learning the structure of the environment, switching attention between features, dimensions and tasks, and adopting new rules in the face of uncertainty. Training cognitive flexibility has strong potential to improve adaptive behavior across the lifespan with impact in real-world settings (e.g. educational, clinical). Here, we review evidence on the role of cognitive training in improving executive functions and the factors that may enhance the effectiveness of training programs. We propose that personalized and adaptive training programs that focus on the multifaceted abilities comprising cognitive flexibility are key for promoting adaptive behavior and lifelong learning in real-world settings.

AB  - Summary
Purpose
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of simulation-based learning using standardized patients (SPs) on cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domain outcomes of learning in nursing students.
Methods
MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, and several Korean electronic databases (to June 2014) were searched. The RevMan 5.3 program of the Cochrane library was used for data analysis.
Results
A meta-analysis was conducted of 18 controlled trials (4 randomized and 14 non-randomized designs), with a total of 1326 nursing students. Overall, simulation-based learning using SPs appeared to have beneficial effects on the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains of learning. In subgroup analysis, use of SPs showed significant effects on knowledge acquisition (d=0.38, p=.05, I2=42%), communication skill (d=1.86, p<.001, I2=15%), self-efficacy (d=0.61, p<.001, I2=6%), learning motivation (d=0.77, p<.001, I2=0%) and clinical competence (d=0.72, p<.001, I2=0%). Treatment effects on critical thinking (p=.75) and learning satisfaction (p=.43) were not significant.
Conclusion
The findings of the current study suggest that simulation-based learning using SPs might have a positive impact on self efficacy and learning motivation that affects knowledge and clinical skill acquisition. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that, if integrated appropriately, an SP educational approach can be used in academic settings as an active learning methodology.

AB  - This mixed-methods study examines how political leaders mobilize collective intentionality during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine US States, and how collective intentionality differs across republican and democratic administrations. The results of our computational and qualitative analyses show that i) political leaders establish collective intentionality by emphasizing unity, vulnerability, action, and community boundaries; ii) political leaders’ call to collective action clashes with the inaction required by health guidelines; iii) social inequalities received little attention across all states compared to other themes; and iv) collective intentionality in democratic administrations is linked to individuals’ agency and actions, suggesting a bottom-up approach. Conversely, in republican administrations individuals’ contributions are downplayed compared to work and state-level action, indicating a top-down approach. This study demonstrates the theoretical and empirical value of collective intentionality in sociological research, and contributes to a better understanding of leadership and prosociality in times of crisis.

AB  - Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of computational models that are often used as a tool to explain neurobiological phenomena, considering anatomical, electrophysiological and computational constraints. RNNs can either be designed to implement a certain dynamical principle, or they can be trained by input–output examples. Recently, there has been large progress in utilizing trained RNNs both for computational tasks, and as explanations of neural phenomena. I will review how combining trained RNNs with reverse engineering can provide an alternative framework for modeling in neuroscience, potentially serving as a powerful hypothesis generation tool. Despite the recent progress and potential benefits, there are many fundamental gaps towards a theory of these networks. I will discuss these challenges and possible methods to attack them.

AB  - Adult acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD) involves a complex spectrum of pathologies, arising primarily from failure of static restrains, leading to collapse of the medial longitudinal arch and further subsequent deformities in the foot. The landmark paper and classification by Johnson et al. proposed that pathology in the posterior tibial tendon (PTT) was key in the development of AAFD. Since then, the understanding of AAFD has evolved and advanced. Multiple structures aside from the PTT, such as the spring ligament, plantar fascia and deltoid ligament, have been identified to play a similarly key role in disease development and progression. Classification systems have also evolved to incorporate this new understanding. These include modifications to Johnson's classification (Myerson, Bluman) as well as new systems which aim to incorporate modern thinking, capture the wide spectrum of presentations or utilize modern advancements in imaging modalities. Current classification systems continue to aid understanding and management of AAFD, despite their increasing complexity. Future classifications should aim to provide a succinct way to describe and understand AAFD, as well as guiding prognosis and management.

AB  - This chapter illustrates the diversity of methods and tools available for developing a geoprospective approach, and, through them, the variety of ways to introduce the spatial dimension in scenarios, simulations, and collective thinking. A number of methods, such as modeling, are not specific to geoprospective. The perspective adopted is to shine the light on what their use in geoprospective entails: the specific constraints and the new questions raised relating to the weight of past evolutions, to the unforeseen, to uncertainty. In addition to the models of the land use and cover change (LUCC) type and companion modeling, this chapter gives much importance to the following new approaches which are hitherto hardly used in geoprospective: scenarios integrating various territorial scales, modeling of the decision-making process coupled with prospective spatial modeling, geoprospective based on causal probabilistic models, graphic modeling, prospective choremes, immersive and 3D simulation in landscapes of the future.

AB  - Underwater localization has consistently remained a prominent technical challenge for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The advent of cooperative localization techniques has emerged as a novel avenue for enhancing localization accuracy. The master–slave cooperative localization mode has gained widespread adoption due to its cost-effectiveness in implementation. In view of the complexity of underwater noise characteristics, in the multi-AUVs cooperative localization system, this paper addresses scenarios involving distance-dependent noise in a master–slave-based multi-AUVs cooperative localization system. To tackle the negative impact of distance-dependent noise and the non-linearity of the distance function, a two-step algorithm is proposed that combines maximum likelihood estimation and the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm (ML-GBP) to estimate the positions of AUVs. The maximum likelihood estimation is employed to cope with the interference caused by distance-dependent noise, and subsequently, the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm, based on range observations and reference information, is used to achieve accurate estimation of AUV positions and implement position correction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ML-GBP algorithm outperforms traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) and nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) methods by enhancing the localization accuracy of the system while exhibiting superior performance in terms of computational complexity and system communication overhead.

AB  - The world contains not only objects and features (red apples, glass bowls, wooden tables), but also relations holding between them (apples contained in bowls, bowls supported by tables). Representations of these relations are often developmentally precocious and linguistically privileged; but how does the mind extract them in the first place? Although relations themselves cast no light onto our eyes, a growing body of work suggests that even very sophisticated relations display key signatures of automatic visual processing. Across physical, eventive, and social domains, relations such as support, fit, cause, chase, and even socially interact are extracted rapidly, are impossible to ignore, and influence other perceptual processes. Sophisticated and structured relations are not only judged and understood, but also seen — revealing surprisingly rich content in visual perception itself.

Although neural, psychological, interpersonal, and socioeconomic elements that contribute to such adaptive, foresighted behaviour mature and/or change throughout the life-span, here we concentrate on relevant maturational processes that take place during adolescence, a period of disproportionate developmental opportunity and risk. A brief, eclectic overview is presented of recent evidence, new challenges, and current thinking on the fundamental mechanisms that mature throughout adolescence to support adaptive, self-controlled decision-making. This is followed by a proposal for the putative contribution of frontostriatal mechanisms to the moment-to-moment assembly of evaluative heuristics that mediate increased decision-making sophistication, promoting the maturation of self-regulated behaviour through adolescence and young adulthood.

AB  - Recent studies have yielded insights into structure–function relations in genetic regulatory networks. Models of feed-forward loops show that the input–output behavior depends critically on the input signal as well as transcription interactions. Models of induction of the lac operon in Escherichia coli reveal the importance of metabolism in determining genetic regulatory network behavior. Combined experimental and computational studies of activation by MarA in E. coli show how mechanisms of transcription regulation, hidden at the level of genetic regulatory networks, can influence behavior. Together these studies illustrate that gene regulation is critically influenced by factors beyond the topology of genetic regulatory interactions. Prediction of the specific information processing roles of gene circuits is more difficult than we would like, but it is still possible. Thinking about evolution of proteins and networks might make it easier.

AB  - Upon the large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced distributed generator (IIDG) into the grid, random faults in the distribution network can lead to momentary and sustained interruptions, significantly impacting system reliability. Although reliability methods have been widely used in distribution network adequacy assessment, using probabilistic method for reliability assessment including system dynamic security need to be investigated. To address this issue, a new method is designed to assess the reliability of distribution network using sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Firstly, the IIDG low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategy is formulated, and the off-grid probability model for IIDG is developed based on the Gaussian distribution. Secondly, the component model is defined to consider the impact of random faults on power quality in security assessment. Following the fault tree analysis method, a protection action probability model was formulated to assess the failure probability of line current differential protection, IIDG anti-islanding protection, and reclosing protection. Finally, the method for momentary fault consequence analysis, based on depth-first search (DFS), and the method for sustained fault consequence analysis, based on the mixed-integer linear programming model, are developed. The study establishes a comprehensive probability reliability assessment framework. The validity of the method is demonstrated on the IEEE RBTS BUS6 F4 system, indicating good scalability.

AB  - Problem Statement
There is no comprehensive tool capturing general vulnerability to biases caused by the use of heuristics. Existing tools focus only on one specific bias or on personality traits.
Research Questions
Can general vulnerability to heuristic thinking be assessed and what are the sub-dimensions of this construct? Can undergraduate students be successfully involved in the research process?
Purpose of the Study
To demonstrate the results of an educational experiment in which undergraduate students are involved in the first stage of development of the Heuristics and Biases Scale (HBS).
Research Methods
After getting acquainted with the underlying theory, students chose one specific bias or heuristic, investigated related results of the experiments and paradigms. At the later stage, under supervision, students developed items intended to capture the chosen bias. Finally, positively evaluated items were combined together and piloted. The psychometrical properties of the items and course outcomes were assessed.
Findings
Developed items formed scales with satisfactory reliability. Course received positive student evaluations, and the assessment indicated that the majority of students achieved intended learning outcomes.
Conclusions
The study indicates that it is possible to develop a psychometrically sound assessment to measure vulnerability to a range of common cognitive biases. Moreover, it is also possible to successfully involve undergraduate students in the development of a psychometrical tool.

The teachers consistently connected economic content to other grades, subjects, and economic concepts and skills. Economic content was also regularly used to prepare students for citizenship, including casting more informed votes and understanding current events. However, authentic discussions, including ones about controversial issues, were mostly lacking. An emphasis was placed on developing students’ economic reasoning skills, including real-world applications of the economic way of thinking and decision-making models. Additionally, active learning instructional practices were frequently incorporated, and economic content was almost always related to students’ interests and experiences. A detailed description of a first step toward a practice-based theory of PCK in secondary economics concludes the article.

AB  - Conventional machine learning methodologies require the centralization of data for model training, which may be infeasible in situations where data sharing limitations are imposed due to concerns such as privacy and gradient protection. The Federated Learning (FL) framework enables the collaborative learning of a shared model without necessitating the centralization or sharing of data among the data proprietors. Nonetheless, in this paper, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the joint model is suboptimal for Non-Independent and Non-Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data, particularly when employing the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) strategy as a result of the weight divergence phenomenon. Consequently, we present a novel boosting algorithm for FL to address both the generalization and gradient leakage challenges, as well as to facilitate accelerated convergence in gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a secure gradient sharing protocol that incorporates Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Differential Privacy (DP) to safeguard against gradient leakage attacks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed Federated Boosting (FedBoosting) technique yields significant enhancements in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in the visual text recognition task on publicly available benchmarks.

AB  - This article revisits Matt Barton's 2005 article "The Future of Rational-Critical Debate in Online Public Spheres" in light of recent debates around misinformation and disinformation, data-driven influence campaigns, the blurring line between social media and news media, and the algorithmic incentivization of “fake news.” While today’s social media platforms exhibit many of the qualities that C.W. Mills and Jürgen Habermas associate with a healthy public sphere—communication between strangers is participatory, immediate, accessible, and decentralized—this article raises questions about the extent to which everyday digital writing and circulation practices align with broader democratic aspirations. The goal of this article is to explore not only what these social and technological developments mean for the health of public discourse, but also how we, as teachers of writing, can meaningfully engage with them in our classrooms. An appendix includes ideas for assignments that engage students in critical reflection about their own participation in today’s online public spheres.

AB  - Constructivism, the notion that knowledge must be assembled from pieces rather than assimilated whole, has been a principal learning theory in psychology for about 20 years and in psycholinguistics for 10. The theory is now making a strong entry into educational thinking, but in language education it is less in evidence. That is because applied linguists have always been constructivists, implicitly, and have already confronted some of the implementation problems facing constructivism in mathematics or science education. Nevertheless, a more explicit understanding of the constructivist approach is useful within language education, particularly in providing a framework for exploiting information technologies.

AB  - The 3N-dimensional maxima of the square of the wavefunction, the so-called Born maxima, show beyond doubt that the electronic structure of atoms persists in molecules, either in their original ground state or some low-lying excited state. The electron density is only a low-dimensional projection of this much richer landscape.
Evidence that the electronic structure of atoms persists in molecules to a much greater extent than has been usually admitted is presented. This is achieved by resorting to N-electron real-space descriptors instead of one- or at most two-particle projections like the electron or exchange-correlation densities. Here, the 3N-dimensional maxima of the square of the wavefunction, the so-called Born maxima, are used. Since this technique is relatively unknown to the crystallographic community, a case-based approach is taken, revisiting first the Born maxima of atoms in their ground state and then some of their excited states. It is shown how they survive in molecules and that, beyond any doubt, the distribution of electrons around an atom in a molecule can be recognized as that of its isolated, in many cases excited, counterpart, relating this fact with the concept of energetic promotion. Several other cases that exemplify the applicability of the technique to solve chemical bonding conflicts and to introduce predictability in real-space analyses are also examined.

AB  - Cascading disasters induced by earthquakes amplify the severity of the initial impact on environment. Although decisionmakers may face uncertainty, an effective mitigation strategy is critical in environmental management. We propose an earthquake-induced cascading disaster mitigation–Bayesian decision network (ECDM-BDN) model to assess pre-disaster mitigating strategies under limited budgets from the perspective of systematic thinking. This model graphically represents the complex relationship among various variables in a seismic hazard system and resistance system based on disaster system theory. It can predict the triggering of cascading events through probabilistic reasoning and identify the key variable accountable for the range of outputs observed through sensitivity analysis. In addition, cost–benefit analyses are carried out by combining Bayesian decision network utility nodes and dynamic programming to obtain a balance between costs and benefits in the context of limited budgets. An earthquake-induced liquefaction served as a case study to demonstrate the proposed model’s effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the ECDM-BDN model can balance the costs and effects of each pre-disaster mitigating strategy as well as select the optimal one according to the utility value. The proposed model can perform a “white-box” decision-making process, which is expected to guide earthquake-induced cascading event pre-disaster mitigation in cases of limited budgets.

AB  - Summary
Background
The ability to distinguish sensory signals that register unexpected events (exafference) from those generated by voluntary actions (reafference) during self-motion is essential for accurate perception and behavior. The cerebellum is most commonly considered in relation to its contributions to the fine tuning of motor commands and sensorimotor calibration required for motor learning. During unexpected motion, however, the sensory prediction errors that drive motor learning potentially provide a neural basis for the computation underlying the distinction between reafference and exafference.
Results
Recording from monkeys during voluntary and applied self-motion, we demonstrate that individual cerebellar output neurons encode an explicit and selective representation of unexpected self-motion by means of an elegant computation that cancels the reafferent sensory effects of self-generated movements. During voluntary self-motion, the sensory responses of neurons that robustly encode unexpected movement are canceled. Neurons with vestibular and proprioceptive responses to applied head and body movements are unresponsive when the same motion is self-generated. When sensory reafference and exafference are experienced simultaneously, individual neurons provide a precise estimate of the detailed time course of exafference.
Conclusions
These results provide an explicit solution to the longstanding problem of understanding mechanisms by which the brain anticipates the sensory consequences of our voluntary actions. Specifically, by revealing a striking computation of a sensory prediction error signal that effectively distinguishes between the sensory consequences of self-generated and externally produced actions, our findings overturn the conventional thinking that the sensory errors coded by the cerebellum principally contribute to the fine tuning of motor activity required for motor learning.

AB  - Over the past few decades, attention in buildings’ design and operation has gradually shifted from promoting only energy efficiency objectives to also addressing human comfort and well-being. Researchers have developed a wide range of control algorithms ranging from rule-based controls to complex learning approaches that can fully capture occupants’ personalized preferences in smart buildings. This direction of occupant-centric building controls can bridge the gap between occupants’ satisfaction and sustainability objectives. However, most of these promising technologies have not yet found their way into real-world applications. This study will perform a critical review on occupant-centric thermal and lighting control studies aiming to (i) analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches; (ii) identify the requirements for these techniques to be implemented in real-world systems; and (iii) propose new research directions that will promote the usability of such controls and will be a catalyst towards their wide adoption. Computational complexity, integration with Building Automation Systems (BAS), data availability and data quality, scalability, and the lack of more research featuring actual building implementation emerge as critical barriers. Addressing these challenges is imperative for the successful deployment of occupant-centric controls in real-world applications.

AB  - The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine whether fluid reasoning (FR) plays a significant role in the acquisition of mathematics skills above and beyond the effects of other cognitive and numerical abilities. Using a longitudinal cohort sequential design, we examined how FR measured at three assessment occasions, spaced approximately 1.5years apart, predicted math outcomes for a group of 69 participants between ages 6 and 21years across all three assessment occasions. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect relations between children’s previous cognitive abilities and their future math achievement. A model including age, FR, vocabulary, and spatial skills accounted for 90% of the variance in future math achievement. In this model, FR was the only significant predictor of future math achievement; age, vocabulary, and spatial skills were not significant predictors. Thus, FR was the only predictor of future math achievement across a wide age range that spanned primary school and secondary school. These findings build on Cattell’s conceptualization of FR as a scaffold for learning, showing that this domain-general ability supports the acquisition of rudimentary math skills as well as the ability to solve more complex mathematical problems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and analytics efforts are too often just extensions or isolated additions to medical practice and research. It could be an extension of research efforts, part of a medical degree curriculum or residency program to extend scholarly pursuits. It could be hospital systems wishing to gain operation efficiency and control. It could be physician groups-of-practice trying to mitigate risk or improve financial performance. While isolated efforts may provide some benefit, leaders understand that exceptional results require a paradigm shift in thinking and the infrastructure to support the new technologies and innovation. In this chapter, we present three pillars that lay the foundation for success in medical research and results in the 21st century. Successful participants will have designed and implemented the following architectures.

AB  - There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy. Specifically, integrating Project-based/Problem-based learning (PBL) with Collaborative learning appears effective in cultivating the capacity to evaluate and create AI.

AB  - Advances in technology have allowed research in cognitive neuroscience to contribute significantly to the discipline of sport psychology. In most cases, the research has become more rigorous and has directed current thinking on the mechanisms subserving a number of psychological theories and models of practice. Currently, the three most common neuroscience techniques informing sport and exercise research are electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we highlight and discuss the contributions to sport psychology that have been made in recent years by applying these techniques, with a focus on the development of expertise, motor cognition, motor imagery and action observation.

AB  - With the rapid development of the era of artificial intelligence, the application ability of programming is also highlighted. As one of the necessary abilities of social talents in the future, primary and secondary schools pay more and more attention to this, and programming education is also in full swing. Therefore, based on previous studies, this paper further clarifies the current situation when the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools is ambiguous. This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching. Although students demonstrate a strong interest in learning, their foundation is weak, resulting in poor learning outcomes. Consequently, the author provides specific recommendations regarding programming education's working mechanism, curriculum standard system, teacher training, and educational resources sharing to better develop programming education in primary and secondary schools.

AB  - Thermoset material data for reactive injection molding simulation process is found in limited sources and seldom available from data bank of simulation tools because of complication not only in rheological and thermal properties measurement but also in writing optimization algorithm to model rheological and thermal mathematical equations. In this paper, rheological and thermal properties of thermoset injection molding compounds were successfully measured. In addition, a numerical method was developed to create material data of thermoset injection molding compounds, which was directly imported into a simulation tool, namely, Moldex3D to investigate its application in thermoset injection molding simulation process. Furthermore, a strong slip phenomenon on the interface between thermoset melt and wall surface which was investigated and detected during injection molding experiments was taken into account in the filling simulation process. The computation was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the new generated material data is reasonable and the influence of wall slip on the mold filling characterization of thermoset injection compounds during simulation process is not ignorable.

AB  - The paper links critique of ‘inner process’ to a perspective that treats language as activity that is accomplished by living beings. The view traces reading to human ways of coordinating with ‘the seen’. Having contrasted this distributed view with organism-first alternatives, I use a case study of reports to sketch how readers engage with written materials to both select details and project an imagined ‘source’ (e.g. a meaning, author or intention). Far from using inner process (‘decoding’) readers coordinate with a field of patternings. Where skilled, they use recollecting to link looking, silent thinking, expectations and strategic moves. Using judgements, they transform what they observe by setting off experience. I thus build on Wittgenstein's critique of inner process while also endorsing Trybulec’s (2019) radicalization of his view. To avoid treating the sense of ‘written words’ as subjective, the material aspect of patternings is taken to index outward criteria (roughly, standards of judgement). In seeking to replace theories that presuppose ‘text’, I stress how patternings invite directed sensorimotor activity by an intelligent person. Indeed, since persons learn to see wordings (or take a language stance) arrangements of patternings act as marks, ‘symbols’ and aggregations that set off recollection, judgements and iterated action. Skilled readers can use re-reading, the already read etc. to modulate ways of attending. Readers link the said, hints, recollections and ways of actualizing movements to grant reading experience a specific sense. By considering how outer criteria are evoked, reading is traced back to skilled linguistic action.

AB  - The bio.tools registry is a main catalogue of computational tools in the life sciences. More than 17 000 tools have been registered by the international bioinformatics community. The bio.tools metadata schema includes semantic annotations of tool functions, that is, formal descriptions of tools’ data types, formats, and operations with terms from the EDAM bioinformatics ontology. Such annotations enable the automated composition of tools into multistep pipelines or workflows. In this Technical Note, we revisit a previous case study on the automated composition of proteomics workflows. We use the same four workflow scenarios but instead of using a small set of tools with carefully handcrafted annotations, we explore workflows directly on bio.tools. We use the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE), a reimplementation and extension of the workflow composition method previously used. Moving “into the wild” opens up an unprecedented wealth of tools and a huge number of alternative workflows. Automated composition tools can be used to explore this space of possibilities systematically. Inevitably, the mixed quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools leads to unintended or erroneous tool combinations. However, our results also show that additional control mechanisms (tool filters, configuration options, and workflow constraints) can effectively guide the exploration toward smaller sets of more meaningful workflows.

AB  - The “Instrumental Revolution” in chemistry refers to a transitional period in the mid-20th century during which sophisticated instrumentation based on physical principles was introduced to solve chemical problems. Historical and philosophical reflection on whether the revolution was a scientific one has been dominated by general models of scientific revolution, in particular, those proposed by Thomas Kuhn, I. B. Cohen and Ian Hacking. In this article I propose that the Industrial Revolution is a useful model for understanding the transformation wrought by the increasingly important role of machines in chemical research. Drawing on Marx's analysis of that event, I argue that that the Instrumental Revolution bears a striking resemblance to the industrial one. I offer grounds for thinking that the resemblance is not fortuitous, but rather reflects a general pattern of development involving the mechanization of the labor process. It is suggested that the cognitive consequences of radical changes in the means of production, as exemplified in the Instrumental Revolution, warrant the consideration of whether the latter is an instance of a kind of revolution in science rather than a singular episode.

It is combined with other filtering rules for more pruning of the tree search. In this paper, the Profile data structure in which tasks are scheduled in a horizontally elastic way is used to strengthen the classic not-first/not-last rule. Potential not-first task intervals are selected using criteria (specified later in the paper), and the Profile data structure is applied to selected task intervals. We prove that this new rule subsumes the classic not-first rule. A quadratic filtering algorithm is proposed for the new rule, thus improving the complexity of the horizontally elastic not-first/not-last algorithm from O(n3) to O(n2). The fixed part of external tasks that overlap with the selected task intervals is considered during the computation of the earliest completion time of task intervals. This improvement increases the filtering power of the algorithm while remaining quadratic. Experimental results, on a well-known suite of benchmark instances of Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSPs), show that the propounded algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art not-first algorithms in terms of tree search and running time reduction.

AB  - Simulation learning can be a valuable tool deployed in support of the learning of students with disabilities in the sciences. In thinking about simulation learning, we must consider two scenarios: (1) When simulation learning will benefit a student with a disability, because other accommodation methods are not appropriate or feasible; and, (2) When simulation learning is applied to all students, where accessibility considerations of the simulation must be taken into account for students with disabilities in the class. In this chapter, we will review the application of both scenarios for simulation learning to students with disabilities in the sciences.

AB  - Access to electricity is still a challenge in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, over 70% of the rural dwellers do not have access to electricity. The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential of a smart microgrid for off-grid rural electrification in Nigeria. A combination of design thinking and model-based design methodology is employed to select a suitable microgrid configuration and to develop a smart microgrid model. A system consisting of a solar photovoltaic array, battery energy storage and a diesel generator is selected, and the model is developed in Simulink. Demand data from 10 rural communities in Nigeria are used to validate the performance of the model and the potential for demand management is considered. The use of energy efficient light bulbs is found to reduce the peak electricity demand of the case study communities by 42 to 76%. Combining the proposed system with the use of LED bulbs makes the system to have 56 to 81% less net present cost than a system with a diesel generator alone and incandescent light bulbs. The proposed smart microgrid is found to be more suitable for off-grid rural electrification in Nigeria than diesel generators which are currently used for off-grid electrification in Nigeria.

The research presented here explores how GAI can enhance creativity and assist Design practitioners with tasks to create products such as, but not limited to, renderings, concepts, construction techniques, materials, data analytics or maps. We apply a framework of combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity to organize how recent advancements in GAI can support each creative category. We propose a conceptual framework of GAI towards transformational creativity, and identify real-world examples to demonstrate GAI's impact, such as transforming sketches into detailed renders, facilitating real-time 3D model generation, predicting trends through analytics and creating images or reports via text prompts. Our work envisions a future where GAI becomes a real-time collaborator to complete certain automated tasks while liberating Designers to focus on transformational innovation.

AB  - ABSTRACT

The efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics (synbiotics when combined) to improve symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has shown considerable inter-study variation, likely due to the complex, heterogeneous nature of the disorder and its associated behavioral, developmental, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Here, we present a precision synbiotic supplementation study in 296 children and adults diagnosed with ASD versus 123 age-matched neurotypical controls. One hundred seventy ASD participants completed the study. Baseline and post-synbiotic assessment of ASD and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and deep metagenomic sequencing were performed. Within the ASD cohort, there were significant differences in microbes between subpopulations based on the social responsiveness scale (SRS2) survey (Prevotella spp., Bacteroides, Fusicatenibacter, and others) and gluten and dairy-free diets (Bifidobacterium spp., Lactococcus, Streptococcus spp., and others). At the baseline, the ASD cohort maintained a lower taxonomic alpha diversity and significant differences in taxonomic composition, metabolic pathways, and gene families, with a greater proportion of potential pathogens, including Shigella, Klebsiella, and Clostridium, and lower proportions of beneficial microbes, including Faecalibacterium compared to controls. Following the 3-month synbiotic supplementation, the ASD cohort showed increased taxonomic alpha diversity, shifts in taxonomy and metabolic pathway potential, and improvements in some ASD-related symptoms, including a significant reduction in GI discomfort and overall improved language, comprehension, cognition, thinking, and speech. However, the open-label study design may include some placebo effects. In summary, we found that precision synbiotics modulated the gut microbiome and could be used as supplementation to improve gastrointestinal and ASD-related symptoms.
IMPORTANCE
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is prevalent in 1 out of 36 children in the United States and contributes to health, financial, and psychological burdens. Attempts to identify a gut microbiome signature of ASD have produced varied results. The limited pre-clinical and clinical population sizes have hampered the success of these trials. To understand the microbiome associated with ASD, we employed whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing to classify microbial composition and genetic functional potential. Despite being one of the most extensive ASD post-synbiotic assessment studies, the results highlight the complexity of performing such a case–control supplementation study in this population and the potential for a future therapeutic approach in ASD.

AB  - In the present article, I review theory and evidence on the psychological mechanisms of mind wandering, paying special attention to its relation with executive control. I then suggest applying a dual-process framework (i.e., automatic vs. controlled processing) to mind wandering and goal-directed thought. I present theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in favor of the view that mind wandering is based on automatic processing, also considering its relation to the concept of working memory. After that, I outline three scenarios for an interplay between mind wandering and goal-directed thought during task performance (parallel automatic processing, off-task thought substituting on-task thought, and non-disruptive mind wandering during controlled processing) and address the ways in which the mind-wandering and focused-attention spells can terminate. Throughout the article, I formulate empirical predictions. In conclusion, I discuss how automatic and controlled processing may be balanced in human conscious cognition.

AB  - Recent progress in optical fibers is impressive, while nonlinear Schrödinger-type models are seen in fiber optics and other fields (such as ferromagnetism, plasma physics, Bose–Einstein condensation and oceanography). Hereby, our symbolic computation on a three-coupled variable-coefficient nonlinear Schrödinger system is performed, for the picosecond-pulse attenuation/amplification in a multicomponent inhomogeneous optical fiber with diverse polarizations/frequencies. For the slowly-varying envelopes of optical modes, we obtain a similarity reduction, an auto-Bäcklund transformation and some analytic solutions, which rely on the optical-fiber variable coefficients, i.e., the fiber loss/gain, nonlinearity and group velocity dispersion. Relevant variable-coefficient constraints are presented. Our results might be of some use in the construction of logic gates, optical computing, soliton switching, design of fiber directional couplers, quantum information processing, soliton amplification in the wavelength division multiplexing systems, solitonic studies in the all-optical devices and birefringence fiber systems.

AB  - The proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (PHFLTS) has been effectively employed in analyzing the group’s hesitancy in linguistic group decision making (LGDM). The application of PHFLTS assists in capturing the individual’s hesitancy across diverse time periods. It is acknowledged that a single word could potentially convey various meanings to different decision makers, such differences can be proficiently managed by utilizing personalized individual semantic (PIS) models. Previous approaches for calculating PIS failed to incorporate the individual’s updating preference information over time, which increases the risk that the computation of PIS is affected by random factors in a specific moment. In our current research, individual linguistic preference gathered over a time period are leveraged to form the PHFLTS. Additionally, a consistency driven optimization model based on PHFLTS is formulated to obtain PIS of linguistic terms. Subsequently, a fuzzy representation model termed as the fuzzy envelope of PHFLTS is introduced to facilitate the computation with words processes, integrating PHFLTS in LGDM. The practicality and legitimacy of these proposed models are evaluated through a comparative analysis. Lastly, these proposed models are tested and applied in a dedicated case study to further prove their usefulness and efficacy.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an automatic computation and data sharing scheme to support management system in coastal fishery using real-time fishery information through information and communication technology (ICT). In Japan, several species of fisheries commodity have not been specified in Total Allowable Catch policy, causing a lot of confusion on fishery cooperatives and fishermen on how to set the catch limit. To deal with the problem, in the previous study, we developed catchable stock index, a method to estimate a certain extent of resource via the swept area method. However, as the calculation of the index was computed on a GIS software manually, it was very time consuming, costly and unable to give an immediate evaluation of the fishing operation. This study aims to support management system in a coastal fishery through the development of automatic catchable stock index algorithm. In this study, ICT was utilized to obtain and transmit the real-time data sharing of fishery information as well as to distribute the computation results to the fishermen and fishery cooperative. The data used were vessels' trajectories and catch records, which included the start/end time and catch amount of each fishing operation. The catchable stock index was automatically computed in an originally developed cloud computing service. We have conducted the test run of the present method in sea cucumber dredge-net fishery on the coast of Rumoi City, Hokkaido, Japan. Data were collected from the entire vessels in Rumoi (16 vessels) during the 2012 and 2013 fishing seasons. The results were returned to the fishermen via the Internet each day during the fishing season, therefore, fishermen were able to immediately evaluate their catch. The estimated catchable stock index for the 2012 and 2013 seasons was 85.5 tons and 92.3 tons, respectively. By referring to the present system, fishermen voluntarily stopped the 2012 and 2013 fishing season several weeks earlier than their initial schedule to avoid overfishing. Moreover, in the previous study, the spacing of the grid has been decided empirically, but in this study, the adequate grid size could be evaluated due to the fast computation through ratio of the area of a grid cell to the total dredged area. In light of the evidence, the present automatic algorithm provided useful information for supporting the self-management of this coastal fishery.

This review paper focuses on two: a modeller's dilemma associated with determining appropriate levels of model simplification, and a dilemma of decision-making relating to the use of models that were never designed to predict. We analyse approaches for addressing these dilemmas as they relate to shallow coastal systems and conclude that wicked problems cannot be adequately addressed using traditional disciplinary or systems engineering modelling. Simplified inter- and trans-disciplinary models have the potential to identify directions of system change, challenge thinking in disciplinary silos, and ultimately confront the dilemmas of social-ecological modelling.

AB  - Summary
The prefrontal cortex is a well-studied but, in terms of understanding what it is for, deeply divisive part of the brain located at the front of the head. Perhaps the least controversial feature of the prefrontal cortex is its complexity. The prefrontal cortex is anatomically, functionally, and computationally complex. It is anatomically complex, containing a number of subregions each sending and receiving projections to a unique set of other cortical and subcortical areas. This interconnectivity presents a serious challenge to efforts to localize function to prefrontal cortex, because it can seem as though information flows everywhere all at once in prefrontal networks. Perhaps as a result, prefrontal cortex is also computationally complex: working memory, abstraction, sensory attention, value-based decision making, planning, and motor control are all functions that have been attributed to the prefrontal cortex. This diversity of functions is likely to reflect the diversity of brain regions that prefrontal cortex communicates with while carrying out the computations it performs to influence behavior.

AB  - Collaborative argumentation is widely used in K-12 and higher education to foster students' argumentation skills, facilitate deep learning, and construct collective knowledge. Collaborative argumentation requires students to coordinate their social, cognitive, and metacognitive practices with peers through interactive discourses. Discourse analysis is a traditional analytic method that has been used to understand collaborative discourses. But most previous research has either integrated computational or statistical techniques to analyze frequencies of discourses or analyzed discourse from a qualitative perspective to demonstrate the microlevel, fine-grained attributes. There has been a lack of integrated discourse analysis method to holistically investigate and understand collaborative argumentation. To fill this gap, this case study used the scripted role strategy to support a group's collaborative argumentation and proposed an integrated discourse analysis approach to illustrate the temporal changes of the group's discourse moves, structures, and turn taking processes. The results showed that four participants had different discourse attributes. Based on the results, pedagogical and analytical implications are proposed to facilitate research and practice of collaborative argumentation.

AB  - Object detection models have been experiencing significant improvements over the years due to advancements in deep learning techniques, increased availability of large-scale annotated datasets, and computational resources. Different object detection models have varying levels of accuracy, speed, and robustness. With the increasing complexity and diversity of object detection models, it becomes a problem for researchers and practitioners to choose the most suitable model for their specific needs. This research paper outlines the escalating demand for robust comparison of object detection models in response to rapidly advancing technology. This evaluation helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of these models and selecting the most suitable one for a specific task. This highlights a significant challenge stemming from the lack of recent comparative studies on object detection models across various image qualities, object sizes, and training data sizes. The above challenges are tackled by a meticulous evaluation of three state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLO-v8, Faster R-CNN with ResNet 50 and 101 backbones, and End-to-End Object Detection Transformers (DETR) utilizing ResNet 50 and 101 backbones by employing a rigorous assessment framework encompassing mean Average Precision (mAP), accuracy, and inference speed. This study focuses on thoroughly examining how well the models perform across three different datasets: TACO, PlastOPol, and TACO 4.5. These datasets consist of open-world images captured in real-time from various locations. They include 1500, 2500, and 6500 images respectively, depicting real-world environments with varying lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. The results identify YOLOv8 as the superior model for high and medium-quality images, while Faster R-CNN performs better for low-quality images. However, DETR's accuracy falls short compared to other models. The paper fills a crucial gap in understanding model performance across varying image qualities and object sizes and helps in taking informed decisions in object detection systems.
