N2 - In this response to commentators, I agree with those who suggested that the distinction between exemplar- and abstraction-based accounts is something of a false dichotomy and therefore move to an abstractions-made-of-exemplars account under which (a) we store all the exemplars that we hear (subject to attention, decay, interference, etc.) but (b) in the service of language use, re-represent these exemplars at multiple levels of abstraction, as simulated by computational neural-network models such as BERT, ELMo and GPT-3. Whilst I maintain that traditional linguistic abstractions (e.g. a DETERMINER category; SUBJECT VERB OBJECT word order) are no more than human-readable approximations of the type of abstractions formed by both human and artificial multiple-layer networks, I express hope that the abstractions-made-of-exemplars position can point the way towards a truce in the language acquisition wars: We were all right all along, just focusing on different levels of abstraction.

N2 - The interdisciplinary spring school “Language, music, and cognition: Organizing events in time” was held from February 26 to March 2, 2018 at the Institute of Musicology of the University of Cologne. Language, speech, and music as events in time were explored from different perspectives including evolutionary biology, social cognition, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience of speech, language, and communication, as well as computational and biological approaches to language and music. There were 10 lectures, 4 workshops, and 1 student poster session. Overall, the spring school investigated language and music as neurocognitive systems and focused on a mechanistic approach exploring the neural substrates underlying musical, linguistic, social, and emotional processes and behaviors. In particular, researchers approached questions concerning cognitive processes, computational procedures, and neural mechanisms underlying the temporal organization of language and music, mainly from two perspectives: one was concerned with syntax or structural representations of language and music as neurocognitive systems (i.e., an intrapersonal perspective), while the other emphasized social interaction and emotions in their communicative function (i.e., an interpersonal perspective). The spring school not only acted as a platform for knowledge transfer and exchange but also generated a number of important research questions as challenges for future investigations.

N2 - Here we report the methods and output of a workshop examining possible futures of speech and hearing science out to 2030. Using a design thinking approach, a range of human-centered problems in communication were identified that could provide the motivation for a wide range of research. Nine main research programs were distilled and are summarized: (a) measuring brain and other physiological parameters, (b) auditory and multimodal displays of information, (c) auditory scene analysis, (d) enabling and understanding shared auditory virtual spaces, (e) holistic approaches to health management and hearing impairment, (f) universal access to evolving and individualized technologies, (g) biological intervention for hearing dysfunction, (h) understanding the psychosocial interactions with technology and other humans as mediated by technology, and (i) the impact of changing models of security and privacy. The design thinking approach attempted to link the judged level of importance of different research areas to the “end in mind” through empathy for the real-life problems embodied in the personas created during the workshop.

N2 - New druglike small molecules with possible anticancer applications were computationally designed. The molecules formed stable complexes with antiapoptotic BCL-2, BCL-W, and BFL-1 proteins. These findings are novel because, to the best of the author’s knowledge, molecules that bind all three of these proteins are not known. A drug based on them should be more economical and better tolerated by patients than a combination of drugs, each targeting a single protein. The calculated drug-related properties of the molecules were similar to those found in most commercial drugs. The molecules were designed and evaluated following a simple, yet effective procedure. The need for substantial computational resources often precludes researchers in many countries and small institutions from participating in the field. The procedure presented here offsets the problem by reducing the cost of involvement. The procedure can be used efficiently in the early phases of drug discovery to evaluate promising lead compounds in time- and cost-effective ways.

N2 - Recent research has demonstrated that mindfulness-based meditation facilitates basic aspects of cognition, including memory and attention. Further developing this line of inquiry, here we considered the possibility that similar effects may extend to another core psychological process—instrumental learning. To explore this matter, in combination with a probabilistic selection task, computational modelling (i.e., reinforcement drift diffusion model analysis) was adopted to establish whether and how brief mindfulness-based meditation influences learning under conditions of uncertainty (i.e., choices based on the perceived likelihood of positive and negative outcomes). Three effects were observed. Compared with performance in the control condition (i.e., no meditation), mindfulness-based meditation (1) accelerated the rate of learning following positive prediction errors; (2) elicited a preference for the exploration (vs. exploitation) of choice selections; and (3) increased response caution. Collectively, these findings elucidate the pathways through which brief meditative experiences impact learning and decision-making, with implications for interventions designed to debias aspects of social-cognitive functioning using mindfulness-based meditation.

N2 - Our overall aim is to develop an emotionally intelligent cognitive assistant (ICA) to help older adults with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to complete activities of daily living more independently. For improved adoption, such a system should take into account how individuals feel about who they are. This paper investigates different affective identities found in older care home residents with AD, leading to a computational characterization of these aspects and, thus, tailored prompts to each specific individual’s identity in a way that potentially ensures smoother and more effective uptake and response. We report on a set of qualitative interviews with 12 older adult care home residents and caregivers. The interview covered life domains (family, origin, occupation, etc.), and feelings related to the ICA. All interviews were transcribed and analyzed to extract a set of affective identities, coded according to the social–psychological principles of affect control theory (ACT). Preliminary results show that a set of identities can be extracted for each participant (e.g. father, husband). Furthermore, our results provide support for the proposition that, while identities grounded in memories fade as a person loses their memory, habitual aspects of identity that reflect the overall “persona” may persist longer, even without situational context.

N2 - The propulsive wing vehicle is a new concept vehicle, which is driven by a cross-flow fan (CFF) embedded in the trailing edge of the wing. The propulsive wing vehicle is capable of cruising and hovering at high angles of attack with very high aerodynamic force coefficients, and has the potential to become a new type of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle. The cruise and hover states of the propulsive wing vehicle are defined, and a numerical model of the two-dimensional propulsive wing is established. Based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, the rotation of the CFF is simulated by using the sliding mesh technique. The effects of cruise speed, angle of attack and CFF rotation speed on the aerodynamics of the two-dimensional propulsive wing are evaluated, and the mechanism of the propulsive wing flow field changes is revealed. The results show that the propulsive wing has a very high lift coefficient of up to 60 at low speed and high angle of attack cruise, and a high thrust coefficient of up to 40 at low speed and small angle of attack cruise. The aerodynamic force of the propulsive wing fluctuates periodically with the rotation of the CFF, and the amplitude of the fluctuation is related to the vorticity of the CFF blade shedding vortex. In hover, the flow field of the propulsive wing is affected by the geometry and wake deflection into an asymmetric distribution, forming a vortex on each side of the airfoil, and the vortex diameter varies with the CFF rotation speed, which in turn has an impact on the hovering performance of the propulsive wing.

N2 - A background assumption of this paper is that the repertoire of inference schemes available to humanity is not fixed, but subject to change as new schemes are invented or refined and as old ones are obsolesced or abandoned. This is particularly visible in areas like health and environmental sciences, where enormous societal investment has been made in finding ways to reach more dependable conclusions. Computational modeling of argumentation, at least for the discourse in expert fields, will require the possibility of modeling change in a stock of schemes that may be applied to generate conclusions from data. We examine Randomized Clinical Trial, an inference scheme established within medical science in the mid-20th Century, and show that its successful defense by means of practical reasoning allowed for its black-boxing as an inference scheme that generates (and warrants belief in) conclusions about the effects of medical treatments. Modeling the use of a scheme is well-understood; here we focus on modeling how the scheme comes to be established so that it is available for use.

N2 - The Snowden revelations in 2013 redrew the lines of debate surrounding surveillance, exposing the extent of state surveillance across multiple nations and triggering legislative reform in many. In the UK, this was in the form of the Investigatory Powers Act (2016). As a contribution to understanding resistance to expanding state surveillance activities, this article reveals the intertwining of diverse interests and voices which speak in opposition to UK state surveillance. Through a computational topic modelling-based mixed methods analysis of the submissions made to the draft Investigatory Powers Bill consultation, the article demonstrates the diversity and intersection of discourses within different actor groups, including civil society and the technology industry. We demonstrate that encryption is a key issue for these groups, and is additionally conflated with a human rights discourse. This serves to unite seemingly disparate interests by imbuing encryption with a responsibility for the protection of human rights, but also threatens to legitimate corporate interests and distract from their own data-driven activities of surveillance capitalism.

N2 - The “crisis in science” today is rooted in genuine problems of model uncertainty and lack of transparency. Researchers estimate a large number of models in the course of their research but only publish a small number of preferred results. Authors have much influence on the results of an empirical study through their choices about model specification. I advance methods to quantify the influence of the author—or at least demonstrate the scope an author has to choose a preferred result. Multimodel analysis, combined with modern computational power, allows authors to present their preferred estimate alongside a distribution of estimates from many other plausible models. I demonstrate the method using new software and applied empirical examples. When evaluating research results, accounting for model uncertainty and model robustness is at least as important as statistical significance.
