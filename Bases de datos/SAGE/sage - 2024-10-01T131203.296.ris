N2 - Tree-like architectures and branching structures are one of the analogical designs that are among the nature inspired structures arousing attention of the designers, inspiring them and that are frequently confronted throughout the history of architecture. Likewise, trees are structural models for designers beyond the plant and branching patterns that are used as architectural ornamentation. Trees have the characteristics of being mentors for architects and engineers concerning how the vertical and the horizontal loads are transmitted through the trunks, branches, and leaves and how the balance is provided. Within this context, it is possible to claim that a quite wide and intuitively developed structural knowledge is acquired with the tree analogies throughout the history of architecture. By the development of computational design technologies, there have been significant developments in the design and the building of tree-like structures. Especially the number of branching, angles of dendroids, lengths, and the other parameters can be defined by using algorithms and can be optimized also by the help of computational tools. In this paper, the historical development and classification of the tree-like structures have been carried out and Frei Otto who is the pioneer to pave the way for innovative structures related to this field has been selected to revisit the efficiency of lightweight columns inspired by nature. One of the experimental studies of Otto in which he called as “minimum path system” has been determined as the case study; the parametric design behind the structure has been analyzed and reproduced by using a parametric software. The structural effectiveness has been determined and discussed by testing the obtained models using a FEM program under horizontal and vertical loads. Consequently, the structural effectiveness of today’s computational technologies and the branching structures that Otto built intuitively and by natural analogies have been able to be tested and the possible potentials that can be leading for today’s architects have been demonstrated.

N2 - ABSTRACT Background Psychosocial variables are key factors influencing psycho-physical equilibrium in migraine patients. Social isolation and vulnerability to stressors may prevent efficient psychological adjustment negatively affecting adaptation to life changes, as that imposed during Covid-19 lockdown. Here, we explored psychosocial dimensions and changes in clinical condition during Covid-19 lockdown in migraine patients, with regard to migraine type and headache impact. Methods Sixty-four migraine patients (32 episodic and 32 chronic) and 64 healthy control subjects were included in a case-control cross-sectional study. A two-step clustering procedure split patients into two clusters, based on the Headache Impact Test. Perceived global distress, loneliness, empathy, and coping levels were compared in groups, as well as changes in clinical condition. Results Migraine patients reported higher general loneliness and lower social support compared to healthy control subjects. Emotional loneliness was more marked in patients with higher headache impact. This subgroup of patients more frequently reported changes in the therapeutic and care paths as the perceived cause of the occurrence of motor or extra-motor symptomatology. Conclusions Migraine patients, especially those more severely affected, proved more vulnerable than healthy control subjects to Covid-19 lockdown. Long-lasting interruption of social interactions may be detrimental in fragile patients that are in need of structured support interventions to maintain psycho-physical wellbeing.

N2 - Background Positive psychology-based (PPB) activities have been under-researched in cancer caregiving. Objective This study investigated caregiver: (1) attitudes toward using PPB activities while caregiving; and (2) characteristics associated with these attitudes. Methods Secondary analyses of a cross-sectional survey were conducted in a national caregiver sample of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. Survey items assessed caregivers’ likelihood of engaging in six PPB activities. Hierarchical regression was performed and potential predictors of PPB activity use (e.g., technology familiarity, coping style, caregiving duration) were examined. Results Most of the N = 948 respondents were White (78.9%), female (65.5%), married (86.7%), employed (78.4%), and college-educated (79.8%). Caregivers favorably disposed to positive activities were younger and female, provided care for 6–12 months and >40 h/week, and used coping styles involving religion and social support. Conclusions Our findings provide guidance for development and testing of PPB activities for cancer caregivers.

N2 - As we strive to improve efficiency and minimise environmental impact in the construction industry, it is important to consider how these objectives impact the work and productivity of designers. This article presents a tool to assist designers in matching reclaimed building products with design intent. The demonstration is based on an actual design project of a two-storey public building made of reclaimed timber from disassembled barns. The algorithm’s objective is to propose optimal matching in terms of a structure’s environmental impact without overloading the user with additional work or excess information. The impact includes emissions embodied in material and related to the transportation from the donor site. The algorithm is integrated into the Grasshopper interface for easier use. All the inputs and objectives are quantitative and fully customisable. The user can still assess qualitative characteristics thanks to a graphical representation of the result. The demonstration shows how automation can simplify the design process with reclaimed elements, support traditional design workflows and enable improvements towards a more sustainable construction industry.

N2 - In December, 2006, a group of 26 software developers from some of the most widely used life science programming toolkits and phylogenetic software projects converged on Durham, North Carolina, for a Phyloinformatics Hackathon, an intense five-day collaborative software coding event sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent). The goal was to help researchers to integrate multiple phylogenetic software tools into automated workflows. Participants addressed deficiencies in interoperability between programs by implementing “glue code” and improving support for phylogenetic data exchange standards (particularly NEXUS) across the toolkits. The work was guided by use-cases compiled in advance by both developers and users, and the code was documented as it was developed. The resulting software is freely available for both users and developers through incorporation into the distributions of several widely-used open-source toolkits. We explain the motivation for the hackathon, how it was organized, and discuss some of the outcomes and lessons learned. We conclude that hackathons are an effective mode of solving problems in software interoperability and usability, and are underutilized in scientific software development.

N2 - Based on the CT scanned images, a realistic geometric model from nasal cavity to upper six-generation bronchia is rebuilt. In order to effectively simulate the particle movement and deposition, LES model is used and the particles are tracked in the frame of Lagrange. Seven kinds of typical particles, including micron particles (1, 5, and 10 μm) and nanoparticles (1, 5, 20, and 100 nm), and three representative respiratory intensities are adopted as computational case, respectively. Deposition efficiency (DE), deposition concentration (DC), and capture efficiency (CE) are introduced. Furthermore, the locations of particle deposition are visualized. The results indicate that the injecting particles from different nasal inlet present “transposition effect.”The DE values of micron particles are much higher than nanoparticles. The particle diameter plays a weaker role in nanoparticle depositions than micron particles. The highest values of DE and DC both occur in nasal cavity, while the highest CE up to 99.5% occurs in bronchus region.

N2 - In future IoT big-data management and knowledge discovery for large scale industrial automation application, the importance of industrial internet is increasing day by day. Several diversified technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), computational intelligence, machine type communication, big-data, and sensor technology can be incorporated together to improve the data management and knowledge discovery efficiency of large scale automation applications. So in this work, we need to propose a Cognitive Oriented IoT Big-data Framework (COIB-framework) along with implementation architecture, IoT big-data layering architecture, and data organization and knowledge exploration subsystem for effective data management and knowledge discovery that is well-suited with the large scale industrial automation applications. The discussion and analysis show that the proposed framework and architectures create a reasonable solution in implementing IoT big-data based smart industrial applications.

N2 - This paper outlines an integrated approach to trust and relevance with respect to arguments: in particular, it is suggested that trust in relevance has a central role in argumentation. We first distinguish two types of argumentative relevance: internal relevance, i.e. the extent to which a premise has a bearing on its purported conclusion, and external relevance, i.e. a measure of how much a whole argument is pertinent to the matter under discussion, in the broader dialogical context where it is proposed. Then, we argue that judgements of internal relevance heavily rely on trust, and that such trust, although occasionally misplaced (e.g. in some so-called fallacies of relevance), is nonetheless based on several reasons, and thus often justified, by either epistemic or pragmatic considerations. We conclude by sketching potential methods to formally model trust in argumentative relevance, and briefly discussing the technological implications of this line of research.

N2 - Lipid droplets (LDs) are unique intracellular organelles that are mainly constituted by neutral lipids (triglycerides, sterol esters). As such they serve as the main site of energy storage in the cell and they are akin to oil emulsions in water. To prevent the direct exposure of the hydrophobic neutral lipids to the aqueous environment of the cytosol, LDs are surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids that thus behave as a natural surfactant. This interfacial structure is rather unique inside the cell, but a molecular understanding of how the LD structure modulates its functions is still lacking, mainly due to technical challenges in both experimental and computational approaches to investigate oil-in-water emulsions. Recently, we have investigated the structure of LDs using a combination of existing and newly developed computational approaches that are optimized to study oil-water interfaces.1 Our simulations provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of the unique surface properties of LDs, suggesting structure-function relationship in several LD-related metabolic processes.

N2 - This paper takes an argumentation approach to find the place of trust in a method for evaluating arguments from expert opinion. The method uses the argumentation scheme for argument from expert opinion along with its matching set of critical questions. It shows how to use this scheme in three formal computational argumentation models that provide tools to analyse and evaluate instances of argument from expert opinion. The paper uses several examples to illustrate the use of these tools. A conclusion of the paper is that from an argumentation point of view, it is better to critically question arguments from expert opinion than to accept or reject them based solely on trust.
