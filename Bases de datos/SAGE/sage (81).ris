N2 - A central pursuit of cognitive neuroscience is to find neural mechanisms of cognition, with research programs favoring different strategies to look for them. But what is a neural mechanism, and how do we know we have captured them? Here I answer these questions through a framework that integrates Marr’s levels with philosophical work on mechanism. From this, the following goal emerges: What needs to be explained are the computations of cognition, with explanation itself given by mechanism—composed of algorithms and parts of the brain that realize them. This reveals a delineation within cognitive neuroscience research. In the premechanism stage, the computations of cognition are linked to phenomena in the brain, narrowing down where and when mechanisms are situated in space and time. In the mechanism stage, it is established how computation emerges from organized interactions between parts—filling the premechanistic mold. I explain why a shift toward mechanistic modeling helps us meet our aims while outlining a road map for doing so. Finally, I argue that the explanatory scope of neural mechanisms can be approximated by effect sizes collected across studies, not just conceptual analysis. Together, these points synthesize a mechanistic agenda that allows subfields to connect at the level of theory.

N2 - The use of individual-level browsing data, that is, the records of a person’s visits to online content through a desktop or mobile browser, is of increasing importance for social scientists. Browsing data have characteristics that raise many questions for statistical analysis, yet to date, little hands-on guidance on how to handle them exists. Reviewing extant research, and exploring data sets collected by our four research teams spanning seven countries and several years, with over 14,000 participants and 360 million web visits, we derive recommendations along four steps: preprocessing the raw data; filtering out observations; classifying web visits; and modelling browsing behavior. The recommendations we formulate aim to foster best practices in the field, which so far has paid little attention to justifying the many decisions researchers need to take when analyzing web browsing data.

N2 - In the current work, the objective is to determine the best efficiency point (BEP) of an axial fan using CFD. Analyzing the performance of the fan based upon the parameters chosen can lead to the optimal design of an axial flow fan for aerospace applications where the ambient pressure varies rapidly. The 2-bladed fan chosen for the study is the Propimax 2L which is considered the base fan used for comparison of all the results of the work. The set of parameters tested were fan rotational speed, ambient pressure conditions, blade count, and the airfoil design. All the performance measures were based on overall fan efficiency. The results yield the following: an increased rotational speed led to higher efficiencies, the most efficient ambient pressure of which the fan can perform is 0.7 atm, a 5-bladed fan configuration produced the highest efficiency, and airfoil selection is critical for fan efficiency enhancements. The results demonstrated that at 0.7 atm the fan efficiency is the highest due to the changes in power consumption to the density effect. A key finding in the work is that higher blade counts do not necessarily lead to higher performing axial fans. A high cambered airfoil provided a higher flow rate at free delivery than that of the Propimax 2L design, but the rotorcraft airfoil did not yield favorable results. The analysis is focused on the fan design of cooling of the electromechanical actuators (EMAs).

N2 - In this article, we examine how critical thinking, methods and design are used within the tech industry, using Philip Agre’s notion of critical technical practice (CTP) to consider the rise of ‘cynical’ technical practice. Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of ‘technical critique’ are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre’s work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily ‘a-critical’ or ‘uncritical’ in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: ‘does it work?’. Drawing on Agre’s studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the ‘Cartesian soul’ of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, ‘narrow’ and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach – via the work of Philip Agre – to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry.

N2 - In order to resolve the issue of coverage limitation for the future fifth-generation network, deploying a relay node within a cell is one of the most capable and cost-effective solution, which not only enhances the coverage but also improves the spectral efficiency. However, this solution leads to the undesired interferences from nearby base station and relay nodes that affects user’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and can cause the ambiguous received signal at the user end. In this article, we have analyzed a relay-based interference-limited network at millimeter wave frequency and proposed a Poisson point process–based model using a stochastic geometrical approach. The results for the proposed Poisson point process model have been evaluated in terms of success probability, network ergodic capacity, and outage probability, compared with the ideal grid model and conventional multiple-antenna ultra-dense network model. The results proved that the success probability and ergodic capacity for the proposed model are 3.5% and 2.3% higher as compared to the most commonly used model for the high-density network, respectively. Furthermore, the results have been analyzed at different multiple-input-multiple-output antenna configuration, which validates the model in the improvement of overall network performance even for higher number of antennas.

N2 - Online discourse integration, or the degree to which online user comments are responsive, that is, address or refer to other debate participants, is a normatively valued yet neglected quality dimension of online discussions. This preregistered study features the first cross-country/cross-platform investigation of online discourse integration, using manual and computational content analysis (N = 9835 and N = 30,753 positional news reader comments). Unexpectedly, about one quarter of the comments was responsive in both majoritarian and consensus-oriented democracies (Australia/United States vs Germany/Switzerland) and on platforms that separate or mix public and private contexts (websites vs Facebook pages of mainstream media), even though other deliberative quality criteria were previously shown to vary by country and platform. Comments that are responsive to fellow commenters in the opposing perspective camp were more likely to contain negative evaluations of those addressed, whereas comments responsive within the same perspective camp were more likely to contain positive evaluations.

N2 - Excitation–contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes requires calcium influx through L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma, which gates calcium release through sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptors in a process known as calcium-induced calcium release, producing a myoplasmic calcium transient and enabling cardiomyocyte contraction. The spatio-temporal dynamics of calcium release, buffering, and reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum play a central role in excitation–contraction coupling in both normal and diseased cardiac myocytes. However, further quantitative understanding of these cells’ calcium machinery and the study of mechanisms that underlie both normal cardiac function and calcium-dependent etiologies in heart disease requires accurate knowledge of cardiac ultrastructure, protein distribution and subcellular function. As current imaging techniques are limited in spatial resolution, limiting insight into changes in calcium handling, computational models of excitation–contraction coupling have been increasingly employed to probe these structure–function relationships. This review will focus on the development of structural models of cardiac calcium dynamics at the subcellular level, orienting the reader broadly towards the development of models of subcellular calcium handling in cardiomyocytes. Specific focus will be given to progress in recent years in terms of multi-scale modeling employing resolved spatial models of subcellular calcium machinery. A review of the state-of-the-art will be followed by a review of emergent insights into calcium-dependent etiologies in heart disease and, finally, we will offer a perspective on future directions for related computational modeling and simulation efforts.

N2 - Parametric interpolation for spline plays an increasingly important role in modern manufacturing. It is critical to develop a fast parametric interpolator with high accuracy. To improve the computational efficiency while guaranteeing low and controllable feedrate fluctuation, a novel parametric interpolation method based on prediction and iterative compensation is proposed in this article. First, the feedrate fluctuation and Taylor’s expansion are analyzed that there are two main reasons to reduce the calculation accuracy including the truncation errors caused by neglecting the high-order terms and discrepancy errors between the original curve and the actual tool path. Then, to reduce these errors, a novel parametric interpolation method is proposed with two main stages, namely, prediction and iterative compensation. In the first stage, a quintic polynomial prediction algorithm is designed based on the historical interpolation knowledge to estimate the target length used in the second-order Taylor’s expansion, which can improve the calculation accuracy and the convergence rate of iterative process. In the second stage, an iterative compensation algorithm based on the second-order Taylor’s expansion and feedrate fluctuation is designed to approach the target point. Therefore, the calculation accuracy is controllable and can satisfy the specified value through several iterations. When finishing the interpolation of current period, the historical knowledge is updated to prepare for the following interpolation. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to evaluate the good performance in accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

N2 - Cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells are quickly becoming mainstays of cardiac regenerative medicine, in vitro disease modeling, and drug screening. Their suitability for such roles may seem obvious, but assessments of their contractile behavior suggest that they have not achieved a completely mature cardiac muscle phenotype. This could be explained in part by an incomplete transition from fetal to adult myofilament protein isoform expression. In this commentary, we review evidence that supports this hypothesis and discuss prospects for ultimately generating engineered heart tissue specimens that behave similarly to adult human myocardium. We suggest approaches to better characterize myofilament maturation level in these in vitro systems, and illustrate how new computational models could be used to better understand complex relationships between muscle contraction, myofilament protein isoform expression, and maturation.

N2 - This work addresses the problem of online exploration and visual sensor coverage of unknown environments. We introduce a novel perception roadmap we refer to as the Active Perception Network (APN) that serves as a hierarchical topological graph describing how to traverse and perceive an incrementally built spatial map of the environment. The APN state is incrementally updated to expand a connected configuration space that extends throughout as much of the known space as possible, using efficient difference-awareness techniques that track the discrete changes of the spatial map to inform the updates. A frontier-guided approach is presented for efficient evaluation of information gain and covisible information, which guides view sampling and refinement to ensure maximum coverage of the unmapped space is maintained within the APN. The updated roadmap is hierarchically decomposed into subgraph regions which we use to facilitate a non-myopic global view sequence planner. A comparative analysis to several state-of-the-art approaches was conducted, showing significant performance improvements in terms of total exploration time and surface coverage, and demonstrating high computational efficiency that is scalable to large and complex environments.
