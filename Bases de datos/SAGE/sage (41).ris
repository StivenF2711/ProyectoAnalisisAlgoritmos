N2 - Background: The focus of the present Letter is on the large and seemingly fertile body of work captured under the umbrella of ‘patient stratification’. Objectives: I identify and explain a fundamental methodological flaw underlying the manner in which the development of an increasingly large number of new stratification strategies is approached. Design: I show an inherent conflict between the assumptions made, and the very purpose of stratification and its application in practice. Methods: I analyse the methodological underpinnings of stratification as presently done and draw parallels with conceptually similarly flawed precedents which are now widely recognized. Results: The highlighted flaw is shown to undermine the overarching ultimate goal of improved patient outcomes by undue fixation on an ill-founded proxy. Conclusion: I issue a call for a re-think of the problem and the processes leading to the adoption of new stratification strategies in the clinic.

N2 - Explosions increasingly occur in densely populated, urban locations. Primary blast injuries (PBIs), caused by exposure to blast wave overpressure, can be predicted using injury criteria, although many are based on idealised loading scenarios that do not necessarily reflect real life situations. At present, there is limited understanding of how, and to what extent, blast-structure interaction influences injury risk, and the suitability of injury criteria that assume idealised loading. This work employed computational fluid dynamics to investigate the influence of blast interaction effects such as shielding and channelling on blast load characteristics and predicted PBIs. The validated modelling showed that blast interaction with common urban features like walls and corners resulted in complex waveforms featuring multiple peaks and less clearly defined durations, and that these alter potential injury risk maps. For example, blast shielding due to corners reduced peak overpressures by 43%–60% at locations behind the corner. However, when the urban layout included a corner and a wall structure, higher pressures and impulse due to channelling were observed. The channelling significantly increased the injury risk at the exposed location and reduced the shielding effects behind the corner. In these cases, the application and interpretation of existing injury criteria had several limitations and reduced reliability. This demonstrates that structural-blast interaction from common urban layouts has a significant effect on PBI risk. Specific challenges and further work to develop understanding and reliability of injury prediction for urban blast scenarios are discussed.

N2 - Since the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ was coined, the respective research field has frequently emulated human mental faculties. Despite diverging viewpoints regarding the feasibility of achieving human-like cognition in machines, the very use of the word intelligence for complex computer systems evokes human consciousness. Likewise, there have been attempts to understand the human mind in terms of computers, exemplified by the computational theory of mind. By contrast, my article underscores the categorical difference between the mind and machines. Partly building upon arguments by David Gelernter and Bert Olivier, I focus on literary examples spanning from Shakespeare to T.S. Eliot that accentuate subjective experience, the intricate relationship between body and mind, and the anticipation of death as human characteristics beyond the reach of computational systems.

N2 - The article aims to prove the effectiveness of the proposed unmanned air vehicle design (The Propulsive Wing) through numerical and experimental means. The propulsive wing unmanned air vehicle is a completely new class of unmanned air vehicle, making disruptive changes in the aircraft industry. It is based on a distributed cross-flow electric fan propulsion system. When the fan starts to operate, the flow is drawn from the suction surface, provided by energy through the fan and expelled out of the airfoil trailing edge (TE). This causes a significant lift increase and drag reduction with respect to ordinary aircrafts, making it perfect for applications requiring low cruise speed such as firefighting, agriculture, and aerial photography. In this early stage of the investigation, our main aim is to prove that this design is applicable and the expected aerodynamic and propulsion improvements are achievable. This is done through a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics investigation of the flow around an airfoil with an embedded cross-flow fan near its TE. A scaled wind tunnel model of the same geometry used in the computational fluid dynamics investigation was manufactured and used to perform wind tunnel testing. The computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel results are compared for validation. Furthermore, an unmanned air vehicle model was designed and manufactured to prove that the propulsive wing concept is flyable. The article shows that the aerodynamic forces developed on the cross-flow fan airfoil are not only functions of Reynolds number and angle of attack as for standard airfoils but also function of the fan rotational speed. The results show the great effect of the rotational speed of fan on lift augmentation and thrust generation through the high momentum flow getting out of the fan nozzle. Wind tunnel tests show that the suction effect of the fan provides stall free operation up to very high angles of attack (40 degrees) leading to unprecedented values of lift coefficient up to 5.8. The flight test conducted showed the great potential of the new aircraft to perform the expected low cruise speed and high angles of attack flight.

N2 - High-throughput experiments enable researchers to explore complex multifactorial diseases through large-scale analysis of omics data. Challenges for such high-dimensional data sets include storage, analyses, and sharing. Recent innovations in computational technologies and approaches, especially in cloud computing, offer a promising, low-cost, and highly flexible solution in the bioinformatics domain. Cloud computing is rapidly proving increasingly useful in molecular modeling, omics data analytics (eg, RNA sequencing, metabolomics, or proteomics data sets), and for the integration, analysis, and interpretation of phenotypic data. We review the adoption of advanced cloud-based and big data technologies for processing and analyzing omics data and provide insights into state-of-the-art cloud bioinformatics applications.

N2 - Traditionally, successive approximation method is applied to the vibration-level adjustment of vibration calibration system, which leads to a time-consuming work for low-frequency vibration calibration. In this paper, a novel control method for low-frequency vibration calibration system is proposed based on adaptive filter. First, the problem of the traditional vibration-level adjustment for low-frequency signals is depicted. Then, an adaptive control algorithm is presented, in which the control input is composed of two weighted sinusoidal signals with a phase difference of 90°. The weighted vector is updated in real time using a modified filtered-x least mean square algorithm. Unlike filtered-x least mean square algorithm, the proposed modified filtered-x least mean square algorithm does not require a pre-identification of the controlled system and has a reduced computational complexity. The convergence property of the proposed method is analyzed in detail. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on a low-frequency vibration calibration system. Experimental results show that the proposed modified filtered-x least mean square algorithm can significantly reduce the time of the vibration-level adjustment in low-frequency band.

N2 - Agent-based modeling is increasingly being used in computational epidemiology to characterize important behavioral dimensions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual responses to interventions, when studying the spread of a disease. Existing agent-based simulation frameworks and platforms currently fall in one of two categories: those that can simulate millions of individuals with simple behaviors (e.g., based on simple state machines), and those that consider more complex and social behaviors (e.g., agents that act according to their own agenda and preferences, and deliberate about norm compliance) but, due to the computational complexity of reasoning involved, have limited scalability. In this paper, we present a novel framework that enables large-scale distributed epidemic simulations with complex behaving social agents whose decisions are based on a variety of concepts and internal attitudes such as sense, knowledge, preferences, norms, and plans. The proposed framework supports simulations with millions of such agents that can individually deliberate about their own knowledge, goals, and preferences, and can adapt their behavior based on other agents’ behaviors and on their attitude toward complying with norms. We showcase the applicability and scalability of the proposed framework by developing a model of the spread of COVID-19 in the US state of Virginia. Results illustrate that the framework can be effectively employed to simulate disease spreading with millions of complex behaving agents and investigate behavioral interventions over a period of time of months.

N2 - In this article, we review the state-of-the-art results in evolutionary computation and observe that we do not evolve nontrivial software from scratch and with no human intervention. A number of possible explanations are considered, but we conclude that computational complexity of the problem prevents it from being solved as currently attempted. A detailed analysis of necessary and available computational resources is provided to support our findings.

N2 - The semi-spade rudder and KP458 propeller of the KVLCC2 (KRISO very large crude carrier) model tanker are adopted by ITTC maneuvering technical committee in the comparative study of ship maneuverability. The incompressible viscous flow around semi-spade rudder and KP458 propeller is investigated using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, the computational grids are generated using ICEM software, and finite volume method is employed to discretize the governing equations. Combined with turbulence model, the hydrodynamic performance of semi-spade rudder is analyzed at different rudder angles, and the result provides a reference for the estimation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of semi-spade rudder. The multi-reference framework method is employed to carry out the numerical simulation of the flow field around the propeller. The thrust and torque of propeller under different turbulence models are calculated in the simulation. The thrust coefficient curve, torque coefficient curve, and efficiency curve are present. The pressure distributions of the pressure side and suction side of propeller blades are studied at different advance coefficient. Based on the study of the hydrodynamic performance of the semi-spade rudder and propeller, the propeller–rudder interaction is simulated and analyzed at different advance coefficient.

N2 - This study undertakes a systematic analysis of media discourse on migration in Sweden from 2012 to 2019. Using a novel data set consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the study answers two questions: What do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about “migration”? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyze a shift in the media discourse seen as one of the outcomes of the European refugee crisis in 2015 and try to understand the role of social media in this process. The results of the study indicate that messages on social media generally had negative tonality and suggest that some of the media frames can be attributed to a migration-hostile discourse. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics provides little evidence for the discourse shift and any long-term effects of the European refugee crisis on the Swedish media discourse. Rather, one can hypothesize that the role of the crisis should be viewed in a broader political and historical context.
