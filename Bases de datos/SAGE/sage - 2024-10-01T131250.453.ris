N2 - This article addresses a fundamental path planning problem which aims to route a collection of heterogeneous vehicles such that each target location is visited by some vehicle and the sum of the travel costs of the vehicles is minimal. Vehicles are heterogeneous as the cost of traveling between any two locations depends on the type of the vehicle. Algorithms are developed for this path planning problem with bounds on the quality of the solutions produced by the algorithms. Computational results show that high quality solutions can be obtained for the path planning problem involving four vehicles and 40 targets using the proposed approach.

N2 - Potential molecular alterations based on age and sex are not well defined in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We examined global transcriptome DLBCL data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via a systems biology approach to determine the molecular differences associated with age and sex. Collectively, sex and age revealed striking transcriptional differences with older age associated with decreased metabolism and telomere functions and female sex was associated with decreased interferon signaling, transcription, cell cycle, and PD-1 signaling. We discovered that the key genes for most groups strongly regulated immune function activity. Furthermore, older females were predicted to have less DLBCL progression versus older males and young females. Finally, analyses in systems biology revealed that JUN and CYCS signaling were the most critical factors associated with tumor progression in older and male patients. We identified important molecular perturbations in DLBCL that were strongly associated with age and sex and were predicted to strongly influence tumor progression.

N2 - Course assignment is a very widespread problem in education and beyond. Typically, students have preferences for bundles of course seats or course schedules over the week, but courses have limited capacity. This is an interesting and frequent application of distributed scheduling, where payments cannot be used to implement the efficient allocation. First‐Come First‐Served (FCFS) is simple and the most widely used assignment rule in practice, but it leads to inefficient outcomes and envy in the allocation. It was recently shown that randomized economic mechanisms that do not require monetary transfers can have attractive economic and computational properties, which were considered incompatible for deterministic alternatives. We use a mixed‐methods design including field and laboratory experiments, a survey, and simulations to analyze such randomized mechanisms empirically. Implementing randomized scheduling in the field also required us to develop a solution to a new preference elicitation problem that is central to these mechanisms. The results of our empirical work shed light on the advantages that randomized scheduling mechanisms have over FCFS in the field, but also on the challenges. The resulting course assignment system was adopted permanently and is now used to solve course assignment problems with more than 1700 students every year.

N2 - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a brominated flame retardant that induces endometrial adenocarcinoma and other uterine tumors in Wistar Han rats; however, early molecular events or biomarkers of TBBPA exposure remain unknown. We investigated the effects of TBBPA on growth factor receptor activation [phospho-receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] in uteri of rats following early-life exposures. Pregnant Wistar Han rats were exposed to TBBPA (0, 0.1, 25, and 250 mg/kg bw/day) via oral gavage on gestation day 6 through weaning of pups on postnatal day (PND) 21. Pups were exposed in utero, through lactation, and by daily gavage from PND 22 to PND 90. Uterine horns were collected (at PND 21, PND 33, and PND 90) and formalin-fixed or frozen for histologic, immunohistochemical, phospho-RTK arrays, or western blot analysis. At PND 21, the phospho-RTKs, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and 3 (FGFR2 and FGFR3), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 (TRKC), and EPH receptor A1 (EPHA1) were significantly increased at different treatment concentrations. Several phospho-RTKs were also significantly overexpressed at PND 33 which included epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), insulin receptor (INSR), AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL), MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine kinase (MERTK), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), ret proto-oncogene (RET), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1 and 2 (TIE1 and TIE2), TRKA, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR;VEGFR2), fms related receptor tyrosine kinase (FLT4; VEGFR3), and EPHA1 at different treatment concentrations. EGFR, a RTK overexpressed in endometrial cancer in women, remained significantly increased for all treatment groups at PND 90. Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) and IGF1R were overexpressed at PND 33 and remained increased through PND 90, although ERBB2 was statistically significant at PND 90. The phospho-RTKs, FGFR3, AXL, TYRO3 protien tyrosine kinase (TYRO3; DTK), HGFR, TRKC, FLT1/VEGFR1, and EPHB2 and 4 were also statistically significant at PND 90 at different treatment doses. The downstream effector, phospho-MAPK44/42, was also increased in uteri of treated rats. Our findings show RTKs are dysregulated following early-life TBBPA exposures and their sustained activation may contribute to TBBPA-induced uterine tumors observed in rats later in life.

N2 - Many Anthropocene scholars provide us with the key take home message that they are writing ‘after the end of the world’. Not because they are writing about apocalypse, but because they are engaging the Anthropocene after the profound crisis of faith in Western modernity which has swept across academia in recent decades. Here the dominant problematic of contemporary Anthropocene thinking has rapidly turned away from modernity’s human/nature divide to that of ‘relational entanglements’. Thus, Anthropocene scholarship is taking a particular interest in geographical forms and cultures which are held to bring this problematic to the fore for more intensive interrogation. In this article, we examine how the figure of the island as a liminal and transgressive space has facilitated Anthropocene thinking, working with and upon island forms and imaginations to develop alternatives to hegemonic, modern, ‘mainland’, or ‘one world’ thinking. Thus, whilst islands, under modern frameworks of reasoning, were reductively understood as isolated, backward, dependent, vulnerable, and in need of saving by others, the island is being productively re-thought in and for more recent Anthropocene thinking. We explain how islands have shifted from the margins in a number of international debates, becoming key sites for understanding relational entanglements, enabling alternative forms of thought and practice in the Anthropocene.

N2 - In 2017, there is no adjuvant systemic therapy proven to increase overall survival in non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab improves overall survival in metastatic treatment refractory RCC and is generally tolerable. Mouse solid tumor models have revealed a benefit with a short course of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade compared to adjuvant therapy. Two ongoing phase 2 studies of perioperative nivolumab in RCC patients have shown preliminary feasibility and safety with no surgical delays or complications. The recently opened PROSPER RCC trial (A Phase 3 RandOmized Study Comparing PERioperative Nivolumab vs. Observation in Patients with Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma Undergoing Nephrectomy; EA8143) will examine if the addition of perioperative nivolumab to radical or partial nephrectomy can improve clinical outcomes in patients with high risk localized and locally advanced RCC. With the goal of increasing cure and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates in non-metastatic RCC, we are executing a three-pronged, multidisciplinary approach of presurgical priming with nivolumab followed by resection and adjuvant PD-1 blockade. We plan to enroll 766 patients with clinical stage ≥T2 or node positive M0 RCC of any histology in this global, randomized, unblinded, phase 3 National Clinical Trials Network study. The investigational arm will receive two doses of nivolumab 240 mg IV prior to surgery followed by adjuvant nivolumab for 9 months. The control arm will undergo the current standard of care: surgical resection followed by observation. Patients are stratified by clinical T stage, node positivity, and histology. The trial is powered to detect a 14.4% absolute benefit in the primary endpoint of RFS from the ASSURE historical control of 55.8% to 70.2% at 5 years (HR = 0.70). The study is also powered to detect a significant overall survival benefit (HR 0.67). Key safety, feasibility, and quality of life endpoints are incorporated. PROSPER RCC exemplifies team science with a host of planned correlative work to investigate the impact of the baseline immune milieu and changes after neoadjuvant priming on clinical outcomes.

N2 - Should court judgments be publicly available for text and data mining purposes? This article shows that the arguments for and against access to judgments conflate different understandings of what judgments are. On one view, judgments are seen as a ‘jurisprudential’ category, whereas the other view regards them as something ‘factual’. Once it is understood that these views and the claims based on them do not fight over the same territory, it should be easier to make judgments more widely available, including for the purposes of computational analysis of judgments as bulk data. The purpose of this article is to help to clear the ground for the debate around access to judgments as bulk data and highlight some relevant considerations for the preferred licencing regime concerning judgments.

N2 - Introduction Digital health technology-based interventions have the potential to support cancer caregivers in caregiving responsibilities and in managing their own health and well-being. The objective of this study was to examine the association between caregiving characteristics and different types of digital health technologies used in a national sample of caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Methods We conducted an online, cross-sectional survey of 948 HCT caregivers. Results Spousal caregivers comprised nearly one-third of respondents (27.1%) with a median age of 59 years (range: 18–80 years), compared with parents (32.9%: 38 years), adult children (28.9%: 38 years), and other (11.1%; e.g. friend, other family member: 36 years). Almost two-thirds (65.4%) of all respondents reported using an app for fitness or step counting and 41.3% reported using a smartwatch. However, spousal caregivers were the least likely group to use mobile apps (0.72; P < 0.005) or smartwatches (OR = 0.46; P < 0.005) compared with parent caregivers in models adjusted for demographics and coping style. Caregiving for six months or greater was associated with the use of fewer apps compared with caregiving for less than six months in adjusted models (OR = 0.80, P < 0.005). Caregivers of patients receiving an allogeneic transplant (i.e. non-self-donor) used more apps on average than caregivers of patients receiving an autologous transplant (i.e. self-donor) in adjusted models (OR = 1.36, P < 0.005). Conclusion Digital health technologies reflect promising avenues for supporting cancer caregivers. While digital technologies are becoming increasingly pervasive, older caregivers remain an underserved population. Future research should integrate older adult caregivers in the co-design and development activities of technology-driven caregiver support products.

N2 - With larger data sets and more sophisticated analyses, it is becoming increasingly common for neuroimaging researchers to push (or exceed) the limitations of standalone computer workstations. Nonetheless, although high-performance computing platforms such as clusters, grids and clouds are already in routine use by a small handful of neuroimaging researchers to increase their storage and/or computational power, the adoption of such resources by the broader neuroimaging community remains relatively uncommon. Therefore, the goal of the current manuscript is to: 1) inform prospective users about the similarities and differences between computing clusters, grids and clouds; 2) highlight their main advantages; 3) discuss when it may (and may not) be advisable to use them; 4) review some of their potential problems and barriers to access; and finally 5) give a few practical suggestions for how interested new users can start analyzing their neuroimaging data using cloud resources. Although the aim of cloud computing is to hide most of the complexity of the infrastructure management from end-users, we recognize that this can still be an intimidating area for cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists, neurologists, radiologists, and other neuroimaging researchers lacking a strong computational background. Therefore, with this in mind, we have aimed to provide a basic introduction to cloud computing in general (including some of the basic terminology, computer architectures, infrastructure and service models, etc.), a practical overview of the benefits and drawbacks, and a specific focus on how cloud resources can be used for various neuroimaging applications.

N2 - Data aggregation is an important method to reduce the energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs); however, it suffers from the security problems of data privacy and integrity. Existing solutions either have large communication and computation overheads or only produce inaccurate results. This paper proposes a novel secure data aggregation scheme based on homomorphic primitives in WSNs (abbreviated as SDA-HP). The scheme adopts a symmetric-key homomorphic encryption to protect data privacy and combines it with homomorphic MAC synchronically to check the aggregation data integrity. It compares the scheme with the previously known methods such as SIES, iPDA, and iCPDA in terms of the data privacy protection efficiency, integrity performance, computation overhead, communication overhead, and data aggregation accuracy. Simulation results and performance analysis show that our SDA-HP requires less communication and computation overheads than previously known methods and can effectively preserve data privacy, check data integrity, and achieve high data transmission efficiency and accurate data aggregation rate while consuming less energy to prolong network lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides both integrity and privacy based on homomorphic primitives.
