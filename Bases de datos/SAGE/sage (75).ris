N2 - There is a growing interest to evaluate the political aftermath of the pandemic. We study how parties attract voters under the redistributive pressure created by COVID-19, looking into the 2021 Ecuadorian elections. We classify the messages that candidates sent, evaluate if and how candidates used COVID-19 to mobilize voters, and assess how voters reacted to them. We followed 858 virtual events and gathered more than 1’575.000 tweets from candidates and their communities. We find that candidates did not place COVID-19 at the center of their strategies but used it to connect with symbolic messages about the capabilities of parties and candidates. Twitter users had a limited engagement with COVID-19-related content. These findings nuance our expectations of the pandemic. COVID-19 was only an element rather than the core of electoral strategies. Our empirical approach can be easily extended to other cases where in-person events are still limited.

N2 - This article advances knowledge on activist technosocial practice by studying the realities and representations of on-the-ground environmental resistance and their intersections with visual representations of protest on Twitter. It does so by focusing on the case of resistance to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, commonly known as TAP, in southern Italy, and on mixed methods for data collection, including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews and an AIassisted visual ethnography of a large collection of computationally collected and categorised images posted on Twitter. By comparing online and offline representations of protest, the study demonstrated that only a partial overlapping existed between them, thus adding a nuance to the digital criminological literature premised on the existence of blurred boundaries between online and offline experiences of injustice. Themes overlapped in their representations of protest, with images of on-theground visual resistance being used on Twitter to extend and amplify the contestation of everyday spaces and to support offline and online initiatives to stop the pipeline. Differences in the recurring themes were instead reconnected to the inherent secrecy of some of the protest’s strategies and to the typical ways in which Twitter tends to be used by social movements.

N2 - Understanding the regulation of gene expression is one of the key problems in current biology. A promising method for that purpose is the determination of the temporal dynamics between known initial and ending network states, by using simple acting rules. The huge amount of rule combinations and the nonlinear inherent nature of the problem make genetic algorithms an excellent candidate for finding optimal solutions. As this is a computationally intensive problem that needs long runtimes in conventional architectures for realistic network sizes, it is fundamental to accelerate this task. In this article, we study how to develop efficient parallel implementations of this method for the fine-grained parallel architecture of graphics processing units (GPUs) using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) platform. An exhaustive and methodical study of various parallel genetic algorithm schemes—master-slave, island, cellular, and hybrid models, and various individual selection methods (roulette, elitist)—is carried out for this problem. Several procedures that optimize the use of the GPU’s resources are presented. We conclude that the implementation that produces better results (both from the performance and the genetic algorithm fitness perspectives) is simulating a few thousands of individuals grouped in a few islands using elitist selection. This model comprises 2 mighty factors for discovering the best solutions: finding good individuals in a short number of generations, and introducing genetic diversity via a relatively frequent and numerous migration. As a result, we have even found the optimal solution for the analyzed gene regulatory network (GRN). In addition, a comparative study of the performance obtained by the different parallel implementations on GPU versus a sequential application on CPU is carried out. In our tests, a multifold speedup was obtained for our optimized parallel implementation of the method on medium class GPU over an equivalent sequential single-core implementation running on a recent Intel i7 CPU. This work can provide useful guidance to researchers in biology, medicine, or bioinformatics in how to take advantage of the parallelization on massively parallel devices and GPUs to apply novel metaheuristic algorithms powered by nature for real-world applications (like the method to solve the temporal dynamics of GRNs).

N2 - Compressed sensing (CS) recently turns out to be an effective approach to alleviate the sampling bottleneck in wideband spectrum sensing. However, the computation overhead incurred by compressed reconstruction is nontrivial, especially in a power-constrained cognitive radio (CR). Moreover, additional information, which is generally unavailable in practice, is needed in conventional CS-based wideband spectrum sensing schemes to improve the reconstruction quality as well as the detection performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel decentralized scheme for cooperative compressed spectrum sensing in distributed CR networks. Our key observation is that the sparse signals are unnecessary to be reconstructed since the task of spectrum sensing is only interested in the spectrum occupancy status. The major novelty of the proposed scheme relates to the use of Karcher mean as a statistic indicating the spectrum occupancy status, thereby eliminating the compressed reconstruction stage and significantly reducing the computational complexity. Considering limited communication resources per CR, a decentralized implementation based on alternating direction method of multipliers is presented to calculate the Karcher mean via one-hop communications only. The superior performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by comparing with several existing decentralized schemes in terms of detection performance, communication overhead, and computational complexity.

N2 - Informal status hierarchy is a ubiquitous feature of social life, and it is one that drives dynamics of dominance, influence, exclusion, and stratification. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this article shows that friendship nominations among adolescents are sensitive to status distinctions and that this sensitivity can be exploited to infer status relations and the level of ambiguity those relations entail. A measure is developed to uncover latent status structures based on such relations among students, demonstrating the existence of complex hierarchical structures among communities. Differentiating between students’ rank (verticality) and embeddedness (horizontality), the analysis reveals orthogonal processes of stratification: A student’s rank is associated with their social role at the school, whereas their embeddedness is linked to traditional markers of stratification, such as race and income. The analysis demonstrates the theoretical utility of incorporating ambiguity of status relations and provides a flexible set of statistical tools to study relational status hierarchies.

N2 - The most critical step in the clinical diagnosis workflow is the pathological evaluation of each tumor sample. Deep learning is a powerful approach that is widely used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline the diagnosis process. In our previous study using omics data, we identified 2 distinct subtypes of pure seminoma. Seminoma is the most common histological type of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). Here we developed a deep learning decision making tool for the identification of seminoma subtypes using histopathological slides. We used all available slides for pure seminoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The developed model showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.896. Our model not only confirms the presence of 2 distinct subtypes within pure seminoma but also unveils the presence of morphological differences between them that are imperceptible to the human eye.

N2 - For high power centrifugal pump which is usually used in high risk applications, circular casing structure has been adopted to increase the reliability of the pump. This special casing structure can make the flow more complex and cause huge hydraulic losses. In this paper, the periodically unsteady turbulent flow in the circular casing of a high power centrifugal diffuser pump has been investigated numerically by CFD calculation. The velocity distributions in different positions were analyzed, and the pressure fluctuation results in time and frequency domains were considered. Finally, the pressure fluctuation intensity coefficient (PFIC) and peak pressure coefficient (PPC) based on statistical thinking were defined on each grid node and the results were analyzed quantitatively to check the time accumulation effect of the unsteady flow phenomenon. The results show that strong flow unsteadiness can be found near diffuser outlet positions of the circular channel and in discharge tube. In addition, the PPC and PFIC results can supply a new angle of view to evaluate the pressure variation, and it is a good supplement to the traditional unsteady pressure analysis method in time and frequency domains.

N2 - A commingled production scheme, where wells are simultaneously completed in multiple reservoir units, offers a cost-effective alternative worldwide. However, their behavior can be more complex than single-unit wells in sequential production. Limited completion studies exist for the unique Paleogene Gulf of Mexico fields. To aid decision-making, we conducted a numerical study using geological and reservoir models of Lower and Upper Wilcox units, based on publicly available data. Results show that commingled production maximizes per-well oil production compared to sequential schemes. Over 30 years, it provides 61% more oil recovery, and over 50 years, it yields 21% more. One-factor-at-a-time design of experiments sensitivity analysis identifies that key reservoir properties influencing oil recovery in both schemes are upper and lower unit thicknesses, facies proportion of the upper unit. Additionally, average permeability of the lower unit plays a significant role in sequential production schemes.

N2 - Background: Due to the high sensitivity of their growing tissues to ionizing radiation, pediatric patients are at a greater risk of cancer development. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the level of radiation exposure experienced by pediatric patients undergoing a common CT examination at the three government hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Materials and methods: Structured formats were designed for data collection at three government hospitals, and then information about pediatric patients’ demography, CT protocols, and CT systems was retrieved and recorded from March 2018 up to July 2018. CT dose indicators: CTDIvol (mGy) and DLP (mGy.cm) values for abdomen, chest, and head CT scans were recorded based on pediatric patients’ age ⩽1, (1–5], (5–10], and (10–15] years old. The data were analyzed through SPSS version 25 software. Finally, the third quartile values of CTDIvol and DLP were determined and compared with other international DRLs. Results: The third quartile values of radiation dose descriptors for abdomen, chest, and head CT scans, respectively, in terms of CTDIvol (mGy): 58, 10, 17, 51; 23, 23, 34, 51; 62, 41, 50, 51; and in terms of DLP (mGy.cm), 377, 314, 624, 664; 523, 571, 406, 739; 927, 806, 929, and 1197 corresponded to pediatric patients of age ⩽1, (1–5], (5–10], and (10–15] years old, respectively. Conclusion: There were significant differences in the radiation dosage of some CT examinations between the same age groups, indicating a need for dose optimization. Therefore, this study recommends the need for enhancing radiation safety, ensuring appropriate imaging practices, and prioritizing the well-being of pediatric patients who visit CT examinations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

N2 - A numerical method is proposed to compute full-tensor permeability of porous media without artificial simplification. Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation and Darcy’s law are combined to design these numerical experiments. This method can successfully detect the permeability values in principle directions of the porous media and the anisotropic degrees. It is found that the same configuration of porous media may possess isotropic features at lower Reynolds numbers while manifesting anisotropic features at higher Reynolds numbers due to the nonlinearity from convection. Anisotropy becomes pronounced especially when convection is dominant.
