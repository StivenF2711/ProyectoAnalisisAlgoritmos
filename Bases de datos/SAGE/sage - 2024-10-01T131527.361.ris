N2 - The fields of music, health, and technology have seen significant interactions in recent years in developing music technology for health care and well-being. In an effort to strengthen the collaboration between the involved disciplines, the workshop “Music, Computing, and Health” was held to discuss best practices and state-of-the-art at the intersection of these areas with researchers from music psychology and neuroscience, music therapy, music information retrieval, music technology, medical technology (medtech), and robotics. Following the discussions at the workshop, this article provides an overview of the different methods of the involved disciplines and their potential contributions to developing music technology for health and well-being. Furthermore, the article summarizes the state of the art in music technology that can be applied in various health scenarios and provides a perspective on challenges and opportunities for developing music technology that (1) supports person-centered care and evidence-based treatments, and (2) contributes to developing standardized, large-scale research on music-based interventions in an interdisciplinary manner. The article provides a resource for those seeking to engage in interdisciplinary research using music-based computational methods to develop technology for health care, and aims to inspire future research directions by evaluating the state of the art with respect to the challenges facing each field.

N2 - Morphological complexity (MC) is a relatively new construct in second language acquisition (SLA). After critically discussing existing approaches to calculating MC in first- and second-language acquisition research, this article presents a new operationalization of the construct, the Morphological Complexity Index (MCI). The MCI is applied in two case studies based on argumentative written texts produced by native and non-native speakers of Italian and English. Study 1 shows that morphological complexity varies between native and non-native speakers of Italian, and that it is significantly lower in learners with lower proficiency levels. The MCI is strongly correlated to proficiency, measured with a C-test, and also shows significant correlations with other measures of linguistic complexity, such as lexical diversity and sentence length. Quite a different picture emerges from Study 2, on advanced English learners. Here, morphological complexity remains constant across natives and non-natives, and is not significantly correlated to other text complexity measures. These results point to the fact that morphological complexity in texts is a function of speakers’ proficiency and the specific language under investigation; for some linguistic systems with a relatively simple inflectional morphology, such as English, learners will soon reach a threshold level after which inflectional diversity remains constant.

N2 - Insertion of transposable elements (TEs) into introns can lead to their activation as alternatively spliced cassette exons, an event called exonization. Exonization can enrich the complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes. Previously, we performed a genome-wide computational analysis of Ds exonization events in the monocot Oryza sativa (rice). The insertion patterns of Ds increased the number of transcripts and subsequent protein isoforms, which were determined as interior and C-terminal variants. In this study, these variants were scanned with the PROSITE database in order to identify new functional profiles (domains) that were referred to their reference proteins. The new profiles of the variants were expected to be beneficial for a selective advantage and more than 70% variants achieved this. The new functional profiles could be contributed by an exon–intron junction, an intron alone, an intron–TE junction, or a TE alone. A Ds-inserted intron may yield 167 new profiles on average, while some cases can yield thousands of new profiles, of which C-terminal variants were in major. Additionally, more than 90% of the TE-inserted genes were found to gain novel functional profiles in each intron via exonization. Therefore, new functional profiles yielded by the exonization may occur in many local regions of the reference protein.

N2 - Political actors play an increasingly important role in the dissemination of political information on social media. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms why specific news items are shared with the support base instead of others. For a timespan between December 2017 and the end of 2018, we combine the analysis of Facebook content from 1,022 politicians associated with 20 political parties from Germany, Spain, and the UK, with an automated content analysis of media coverage from 22 major online news outlets, and survey data in a multilevel binomial regression approach. By comparing news items that have been shared by one or several political parties with news items that have not been shared by any of them, we overcome the selection biases of previous studies in the field of news dissemination. Findings show that a news item’s likelihood to be shared by a politician increases (1) if that politician’s party is mentioned in the news item, (2) the more salient their party’s owned issues are in the news item, and (3) the more party supporters tend to read the news outlet in which the news item is published. We contextualize these findings in light of political actors’ multi-faceted motivations for news sharing on social media and discuss how this process potentially reinforces an information bias that may contribute to the polarization and fragmentation of audiences.

N2 - One major focus on the performance researches of pump as turbine is how to enhance the efficiency of energy recovery. While the key point of increasing the efficiency is to improve the performance of the blade profile which is structural basis of the blade geometry. This article presents an optimization method for the blade profile. It contained the parameterization of blade profile, the Latin Hypercube experimental design, the computational fluid dynamics techniques, the back propagation neural network, and genetic algorithm. Specifically, the nonuniform cubic B-spline curve was used to parameterize the blade profile, the Latin Hypercube experimental design method for the acquirement of the sample points of back propagation neural network. The performance analysis of each sample point was accomplished by the computational fluid dynamics techniques. Then, the learning and training of the back propagation neural network was carried out. Finally, the optimization techniques of combining the back propagation neural network and genetic algorithm were used to solve the optimization problems of the blade profile. Based on the above method, the blade profile of a pump as turbine was optimized and improved. The result shows that the efficiency of the optimized pump as turbine under the optimum operating condition was increased by 2.91%, with the constraint condition to ensure that the difference between the head and the initial head of the pump as turbine is less than the specified value. This proves that using the above method to optimize the blade profile is feasible.

N2 - The mind represents abstract magnitude information, including time, space, and number, but in what format is this information stored? We show support for the bipartite format of perceptual magnitudes, in which the measured value on a dimension is scaled to the dynamic range of the input, leading to a privileged status for values at the lowest and highest end of the range. In six experiments with college undergraduates, we show that observers are faster and more accurate to find the endpoints (i.e., the minimum and maximum) than any of the inner values, even as the number of items increases beyond visual short-term memory limits. Our results show that length, size, and number are represented in a dynamic format that allows for comparison-free sorting, with endpoints represented with an immediately accessible status, consistent with the bipartite model of perceptual magnitudes. We discuss the implications for theories of visual search and ensemble perception.

N2 - This article traces the development of the Water Cooler Logic methodology and its most innovative feature, stakeholder ethnography, from within the conceptual setting of Silicon Valley in the nineties. I sketch a line of direct and indirect influences starting from computational ideas of intelligence, early corporate uses of ethnography, and new institutional forms to the Institute for Research on Learning’s commitment to a social view of learning and Water Cooler Logic’s action-oriented work with clients around their practical organizational concerns. Building on and sometimes re-interpreting earlier achievements, Water Cooler Logic works at the boundary of university and industry, combining research and intervention in one seamless methodology. On the academic side, Water Cooler Logic views organizations as social networks and functional systems and relies on interdisciplinary teams to overcome the obstacles inherent in the distributed nature of knowledge and local institutional constraints. On its corporate side, it makes deliberative and pragmatic choices in selecting areas of concern and developing concrete, implementable solutions. The Water Cooler Logic process offers stakeholders the opportunity to become reflective practitioners, para-ethnographers and change agents in their own organizations. At the same time it changes the role of the consultant to one who acts as mid-wife to the innovations emerging organically in the client organization.

N2 - Purpose ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can solve multiple complex tasks. ChatGPT-4 can facilitate educational empowerment in China through technology to understand and generate Chinese text. Although ChatGPT’s benefits have been widely discussed, its educational capabilities have not been systematically assessed. This study provides evidence of and insights into the educational applications of AI tools in China. Design/Approach/Methods This study uses various tests to systematically assess the latest iteration of the AI chatbot ChatGPT-4, including the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA), Five Core Competencies Questionnaire, and written test of China’s 2022 National Teacher Certificate Examination (NTCE). Findings The WGCTA results suggest that ChatGPT requires strong critical thinking. Compared with the other four competencies, the tool showed a lower aptitude for creativity. Regarding its educational applications, ChatGPT performed well on the 2022 NTCE written test. As technology enhances, ChatGPT and similar AI tools have potential applications in China for lesson planning, student self-learning, classroom interaction, and checking assignments. Originality/Value This study systematically tested ChatGPT at a logical level and assessed its core competencies and educational applications. The study innovatively used 2022 NTCE data to test ChatGPT, with results providing support for the application of generative AI in future curricula and instruction in China.
