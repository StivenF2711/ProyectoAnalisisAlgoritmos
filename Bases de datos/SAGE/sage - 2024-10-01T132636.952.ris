N2 - Modeling and control for a novel coaxial ducted fan aerial robot in-ground-effect is presented in this article. Based on experiments using the ducted fan bench test, the fitting curve of the ground effect thrust of the ducted fan aerial robot at different heights is obtained. In addition, the flow field simulation results of the prototype with ground effect at different heights can be obtained using computational fluid dynamics software. A simplified model of the prototype for control can be designed based on several reasonable hypotheses that are established using blade element and momentum theory. To compensate for the disturbance associated with ground effect, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate the disturbance, and control structure of the closed-loop system is composed of a nonlinear disturbance observer combined with a double-loop proportion–integration–differentiation controller. The results of several numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller structure. The performances of tracking trajectory and system stability are improved significantly, compared to the situation that the ground effect is not compensated for.

N2 - This article discusses the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize contract thinking and design. Experience and research tell us that most contracts focus on the wrong things—failure rather than success—and are presented in a way that is inaccessible to many people. Using the principles of proactive contracting and contract design, AI-powered writing assistants such as ChatGPT can help change the contracting paradigm by facilitating the transition from drafting to design and from reaction to proactive action. They can help transform the content, language, structure, and presentation of contracts, simplifying the tedious parts and increasing stakeholder empowerment and choice. This exploratory article presents examples of using AI tools to generate ideas and clauses for commercial contracts and to support contract redesign. This facilitates the creation of easy-to-read explanations, headings, and layered layouts that make contracts more effective, transparent, and sustainable, leading to better business and societal outcomes.

N2 - Humanitarian agencies are relying more frequently on remote sensing, satellite imagery and social media to produce accounts of violence. Their analysis aims at creating more compelling narratives for the court of law or of public opinion and has contributed towards a forensic turn, thus complicating the already fraught relationship between the practice of witnessing and political subjects. This article explores how digital witnessing allows us to ‘see’ further and deeper into places that are at a distance from us, whilst at the same time creating the conditions that make certain subjects recede from view. I will discuss these issues in relation to a country I am familiar with and one that has been central to the forensic imagination – Pakistan – although the particular geographies within Pakistan that this imagination works with are not mine. Thinking with non-linear temporalities of violence, I explore how the forensic turn may have actually contributed to the erasure of the racialized political subject.

N2 - The organization of flow production, which is typical found in assembly processes, involves a repetitive, fixed-takt time flow of same-size production batches. The cyclic nature of the production flow, which ensures a steady production rhythm, enables just-in-time planning and organization of the associated supply chains. Disruptions in the operation of machinery and equipment, which occur in practice, lead to deviations from nominal operation times. These types of local disturbances lead to changes in production takt time, making it necessary to adjust previously created schedules for delivery/reception of materials and products. Assuming that a control action can be taken to adjust transport operation times within a specified time range, the problem of cyclic scheduling of production flows boils down to seeking conditions the satisfaction of which will guarantee robustness to this kind of disruptions. Satisfaction of robustness conditions allows a return to the nominal production takt time and appropriate adjustment of the production flow trajectory (which makes it possible for the system to return to the previously scheduled delivery times). Numerous examples are included to illustrate the principles of the proposed research methodology aimed at finding solutions for robust scheduling of fixed-takt time production flow.

N2 - This study focuses on an important yet often neglected topic in public personnel competency studies: competencies required for digital government. It addresses the question: Which competencies do civil servants need for data-driven decision-making (DDDM) in local governments? Empirical data are obtained through a combination of 12 expert interviews and 22 Behavioral Event Interviews. Our analysis shows that DDDM as observed in this study is a hybrid process that contains elements of both “traditional” and “data-driven” decision-making. We identified eight competencies that are required in this process: data literacy, critical thinking, teamwork, domain expertise, data analytical skills, engaging stakeholders, innovativeness, and political astuteness. These competencies are also hybrid: a combination of more “traditional” (e.g., political astuteness) and more “innovative” (e.g., data literacy) competencies. We conclude that local governments need to invest resources in developing or selecting these competencies among their employees, to exploit the possibilities data offers in a responsible way.

N2 - The understanding and prediction of NOx emissions formation mechanisms during engine transients are critical to the monitoring of real driving emissions. While many studies focus on the engine out NOx formation and treatment, few studies consider cyclic transient NOx emissions due to the low time resolution of conventional emission analysers. Increased computational power and substantial quantities of accessible engine testing data have made ANN a suitable tool for the prediction of transient NOx emissions. In this study, the transient predictive ability of artificial neural networks where a large number of engine testing data are available has been studied extensively. Significantly, the proposed transient model is trained from steady-state engine testing data. The trained data with 14 input features are provided with transient signals which are available from most engine testing facilities. With the help of a state-of-art high-speed NOx analyser, the predicted transient NOx emissions are compared with crank-angle resolved NOx measurements taken from a high-speed light duty diesel engine at test conditions both with and without EGR. The results show that the ANN model is capable of predicting transient NOx emissions without training from crank-angle resolved data. Significant differences are captured between the predicted transient and the slow-response NOx emissions (which are consistent with the cycle-resolved transient emissions measurements). A particular strength is found for increasing load steps where the instantaneous NOx emissions predicted by the ANN model are well matched to the fast-NOx analyser measurements. The results of this work indicate that ANN modelling could strongly contribute to the understanding of real driving emissions.

N2 - The aim of this paper is to deploy a time-of-flight (ToF) based photonic mixer device (PMD) camera on an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) whose overall target is to traverse from one point to another in hazardous and hostile environments employing obstacle avoidance without human intervention. The hypothesized approach of applying a ToF Camera for an AGV is a suitable approach to autonomous robotics because, as the ToF camera can provide three-dimensional (3D) information at a low computational cost, it is utilized to extract information about obstacles after their calibration and ground testing and is mounted and integrated with the Pioneer mobile robot. The workspace is a two-dimensional (2D) world map which has been divided into a grid/cells, where the collision-free path defined by the graph search algorithm is a sequence of cells the AGV can traverse to reach the target. PMD depth data is used to populate traversable areas and obstacles by representing a grid/cells of suitable size. These camera data are converted into Cartesian coordinates for entry into a workspace grid map. A more optimal camera mounting angle is needed and adopted by analysing the camera’s performance discrepancy, such as pixel detection, the detection rate and the maximum perceived distances, and infrared (IR) scattering with respect to the ground surface. This mounting angle is recommended to be half the vertical field-of-view (FoV) of the PMD camera. A series of still and moving tests are conducted on the AGV to verify correct sensor operations, which show that the postulated application of the ToF camera in the AGV is not straightforward. Later, to stabilize the moving PMD camera and to detect obstacles, a tracking feature detection algorithm and the scene flow technique are implemented to perform a real-time experiment.

N2 - Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the evolution of the human capacity for language. Such a project is necessarily interdisciplinary. However, that interdisciplinarity brings with it a risk: terms with a technical meaning in their own field are used wrongly or too loosely by those from other backgrounds. Unfortunately, this risk has been realized in the case of language evolution, where many of the terms of social evolution theory (reciprocal altruism, honest signaling, etc.) are incorrectly used in a way that suggests that certain key fundamentals have been misunderstood. In particular the distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations is often lost, with the result that several claims made by those interested in language evolution are epistemically incoherent. However, the correct application of social evolution theory provides simple, clear explanations of why language most likely evolved and how the signals used in language — words — remain cheap yet arbitrary.

N2 - In order to realize a methodical, effective cooperative stimulation for MANETs and search dynamic trust cooperative stimulation scheme in environment under a high malicious ratio, we have proposed an evolutionary game-based trust cooperative stimulation model for large scale MANETs in this paper. First, the system members’ pluralistic behavior for MANETs has been covered by means of constructing the complete multirisk level strategy space. Then a trust-preferential strategy has been built through trust numerical value mapping technology, which achieves the aim that the malicious action is effectively constrained to avoid a low trust level. Furthermore, the mobility probable parameters and information propagation error matrix are introduced into game model, and the convergence condition between optimum strategy which represents payoff maximization principle and trust-preferential strategy is deduced through evolutionary analyzing finally. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments have demonstrated that our model can effectively stimulate cooperation among members and meanwhile be robust under the condition where the environment is harsh under a high original malicious ratio in large scale MANETs.

N2 - Based on the linear displacement motion similarity and angular displacement motion similarity, the similarity law for free flight test of light store separation from aircraft is deduced. The problem that the ideal test model is too light to be processed and the free flight separation test in wind tunnel is harder to achieve due to the model scaling is solved. The new similarity law was simplified reasonably, and the relationship equation between separation velocity and model mass was obtained. The wind-loaded state is simulated by computational fluid dynamics, and the real separation data of aircraft, the separation data of previous test methods, and the simulation data of different mass and different separation velocity trajectories of this similarity law are obtained. The improved effect of the new similarity law is verified by data comparison. The results show that by properly increasing the mass of wind tunnel test model, the difficulty of wind tunnel test can be greatly reduced while the separation trajectory is similar, and the angular displacement error can be guaranteed to be within acceptable range. In order to ensure better consistency between flight and free flight wind tunnel test, it solves the problem that similarity law can only be designed but cannot be realized.
