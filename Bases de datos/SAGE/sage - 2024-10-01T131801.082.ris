N2 - Various sensors have achieved large-scale deployment as important data sources in intelligent transportation systems, and abundant data are generated and processed into useful information and new services. The means by which to make effective use of this information and these services to benefit the driver and improve road safety is very important in an intelligent transportation system. This research aims to describe the design and implementation of a context-aware service system for perceiving the driving situation and providing the most appropriate function or information services to address the actual needs in a driving assistance environment. To describe various hazardous situations, the status-emphasized context model and reasoning rules are proposed to abstract the context information and facilitate better understanding the driver’s context. The approach of customized service invocation is proposed by the retrieval of the service configuration model, which builds the relationship between the driver’s status and appropriate business services. In addition, to address the situations with multiple hazards, a priority- and severity-based invocation control algorithm is proposed; through this algorithm, the invocation procedure can be determined based on the priority and severity of the hazards. An evaluation based on computational experiments is conducted to verify the availability and validity of the service system.

N2 - History-graded increases in older adults’ levels of cognitive performance are well documented, but little is known about historical shifts in within-person change: cognitive decline and onset of decline. We combined harmonized perceptual-motor speed data from independent samples recruited in 1990 and 2010 to obtain 2,008 age-matched longitudinal observations (M = 78 years, 50% women) from 228 participants in the Berlin Aging Study (BASE) and 583 participants in the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). We used nonlinear growth models that orthogonalized within- and between-person age effects and controlled for retest effects. At age 78, the later-born BASE-II cohort substantially outperformed the earlier-born BASE cohort (d = 1.20; 25 years of age difference). Age trajectories, however, were parallel, and there was no evidence of cohort differences in the amount or rate of decline and the onset of decline. Cognitive functioning has shifted to higher levels, but cognitive decline in old age appears to proceed similarly as it did two decades ago.

N2 - This survey article is a comprehensive discussion on Intelligent Optimization of Wireless Sensor Networks through Bio-Inspired Computing. The marvelous perfection of biological systems and its different aspects for optimized solutions for non-biological problems is presented here in detail. In the current research inclination, hiring of biological solutions to solve and optimize different aspects of artificial systems’ problems has been shaped into an important field with the name of bio-inspired computing. We have tabulated the exploitation of key constituents of biological system for developing bio-inspired systems to represent its importance and emergence in problem solving trends. We have presented how the metaphoric relationship is developed between the two biological and non-biological systems by quoting an example of relationship between prevailing wireless system and the natural system. Interdisciplinary research is playing a splendid contribution for various problems’ solving. The process of combining the individuals’ output to form a single problem solving solution is depicted in three-stage ensemble design. Also the hybrid solutions from computational intelligence-based optimization are elongated to demonstrate the emergent involvement of these inspired systems with rich references for the interested readers. It is concluded that these perfect creations have remedies for most of the problems in non-biological system.

N2 - One of the possible objective and universal descriptions of most folk songs can be based on structural musical characteristics such as contour, tone set, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. Experimental studies in the recent decade supported the universal importance of contour and tonality as the two most important characteristics determining human music cognition and memory. It follows from this statement that a mathematically adequate description of folk songs should be based on both contour and tonality information. We describe a method searching for characteristic groups of universal melody types (MTs) propagating jointly and regularly in several subsets of 59 folk music cultures in Eurasia and America, represented by a database of 59,000 folk songs. The MTs are represented by pairs of contour and degree distribution vectors. We describe the propagation of the MTs by 59-dimensional vectors containing their “moments” in the 59 cultures studied. We show that principal component analysis (PCA) of these moment vectors reveals assumable ancestor cultures, and we show a method modeling the 59 musical cultures as linear combinations of the musical contents of seven assumable ancestral cultures. The results provide a method and a hypothesis for tracking the footprints of assumable ancient musical “primary languages” in folk music traditions in Eurasia and America. The assumable musical ancestral cultures presented here show good correspondence with the distribution of certain human genetic characteristics and archaeogenetic results.

N2 - Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the stomach is a rare type of cancer with a slowly rising incidence. It tends to be more difficult to detect by pathologists, mainly due to its cellular morphology and diffuse invasion manner, and it has poor prognosis when detected at an advanced stage. Computational pathology tools that can assist pathologists in detecting SRCC would be of a massive benefit. In this paper, we trained deep learning models using transfer learning, fully-supervised learning, and weakly-supervised learning to predict SRCC in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a training set of 1,765 WSIs. We evaluated the models on two different test sets (n = 999, n = 455). The best model achieved a ROC-AUC of at least 0.99 on all two test sets, setting a top baseline performance for SRCC WSI classification.

N2 - This study examines the temporal dynamics of emotional appeals in Russian campaign messages used in the 2016 election. Communications on two giant social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter, are analyzed to assess emotion in message content and targeting that may have contributed to influencing people. The current study conducts both computational and qualitative investigations of the Internet Research Agency’s (IRA) emotion-based strategies across three different dimensions of message propagation: the platforms themselves, partisan identity as targeted by the source, and social identity in politics, using African American identity as a case. We examine (1) the emotional flows along the campaign timeline, (2) emotion-based strategies of the Russian trolls that masked left- and right-leaning identities, and (3) emotion in messages projecting to or about African American identity and representation. Our findings show sentiment strategies that differ between Facebook and Twitter, with strong evidence of negative emotion targeting Black identity.

N2 - LLM-based chatbots’ ability to generate contextually appropriate and informative texts can be taken as an indication that they are also able to understand text. We argue instead that the separation of the two competences to generate and to understand text is the key to their performance in dialog with human users. This argument requires a shift in perspective from a concern with machine intelligence to a concern with communicative competence. We illustrate our argument with empirical examples of what conversation analysis calls ‘repair’, showing that the management of trouble by chatbots is not based on an underlying understanding of what is going on but rather on their use of the feedback by human conversational partners. In the conclusion we suggest that strategies for the interaction between chatbots and users should not aim to improve computational skills but to develop a new communicative competence.

N2 - Purpose Examine the association of visits to the natural environment, connectedness to nature, physical activity, and the adoption of pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) in individuals aged 18 years or older. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting City of Vila Real, located in the north of Portugal. Subjects We recruited 194 individuals (61 men and 133 women) aged 18-75 years. Mesures A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure nature visits, connectedness to nature, PEBs, and demographic characteristics. Neighborhood green space was appreciated through a Simplified Land Occupation Map and physical activity was measured using ActiGraph accelerometers (wGT3X-BT). Analysis Correlations and nonlinear canonical correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. The coefficients of canonical and multiple correlations were calculated. Results Nature visits were associated with involvement in environmental volunteering (V = .317, P ≤ .05) among men. In these, higher levels of moderate-vigorous PA were associated with green travel behavior (η2 = .325, P ≤ .05). Connectedness with nature was related (P ≤ .05) to private sphere behaviors, such as purchase of eco-products (η2 = .191) and local/seasonal products (η2 = .186) in females and encouraging care and protection of natural environment (η2 = .336, P ≤ .01) in males. Conclusions Nature visits, connection to nature, and physical activity levels were related to the adoption of PEBs in the private and public sphere, and these relationships differed between men and women.

N2 - The author plots the proportions of people in 20 European countries who believe in biological racial differences, contributing to debates about the role of race and racism in Europe: whether Europeans think in biological racial terms and whether thinking about racism is an adequate framework in the European context. The main new insight is simply providing concrete empirical evidence that beliefs in biological race are widely spread in Europe. Second, this visualization highlights that ideas about races being born “more hardworking” are a more socially acceptable and widely spread form of belief in racial differences than beliefs in races being born “less intelligent”. Third, it shows how the difference between the two types of biological racial beliefs organizes countries into an east-west axis, whereas no such division is apparent when looking only at the magnitudes of the proportions of people who hold racial beliefs.

N2 - This paper presents a novel matrix completion algorithm to enable energy efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks. The algorithm takes full advantage of both the low-rankness and the DCT compactness features in the sensory data to improve the recovery accuracy. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed, which indicates it has a low computational cost. Moreover, the recovery error is carefully analyzed and a theoretical upper bound is derived. The error bound is then validated by experimental results. Extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets collected from two testbeds. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for low sampling rate and achieves a good recovery accuracy even if the sampling rate is very low.
