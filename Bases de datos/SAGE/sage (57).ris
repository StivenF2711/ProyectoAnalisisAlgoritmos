N2 - Background: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but it is still affected by high non-maturation and early failure rates due to stenosis development. Increasing evidence suggests that the presence of turbulent-like flow may play a key role, therefore, to stabilize the flow in the venous segment, an external support device (VasQTM) has been designed. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary evidence of VasQTM impact on AVF hemodynamics as compared to AVFs created with conventional surgery. Methods: In this pilot single-center prospective randomized study six patients were enrolled, three in the VasQ group and three in the control group. Contrast-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired at 3 days, 3 months and 1 year after AVF surgery and were used to generate 3D patient-specific models. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed using pimpleFoam, imposing patient-specific flow waveforms derived from ultrasound (US) examinations at the inlet of the proximal and distal artery, and a traction-free condition at the venous outflow. Morphologic and hemodynamic changes occurring over time were compared between VasQ and control AVFs. Results: Our MRI protocol provided high-quality images suitable for reliable segmentation and reconstruction of patient-specific 3D models of AVFs at all three timepoints in four out of six patients. The VasQTM device maintained the angle between the artery and the vein almost unchanged over time, with a more stable flow in the AVFs supported by the device. In contrast, one of the AVFs of the control group evolved to an extreme dilatation of the vein and highly disturbed flow, while the other developed a stenosis in the juxta-anastomotic region. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of characterizing the morphological and hemodynamic changes occurring over time in AVFs created using the VasQTM device and provided preliminary evidence of the potential hemodynamic benefits of its use.

N2 - Background: There is accumulating evidence that addressing modifiable risk and protective factors has an impact on dementia rates. Insight into the public’s perspectives on dementia risk reduction is needed to inform future individual-level interventions and public health approaches. Objective: This study explores the publics’ openness towards dementia risk reduction and willingness towards changing lifestyle behavior to reduce the future risk for dementia. Methods: Using a screening questionnaire, participants were purposively selected based on lifestyle behaviors that are associated with dementia risk. One-on-one interviews were used to explore their openness towards dementia risk reduction and willingness towards behavior change. Independently, two researchers performed an inductive content analysis. Results: Interviews were conducted with 23 participants aged from 40 to 79 years. Main themes that were identified from the data were: 1) abstractness of dementia risk reduction, 2) ambivalence towards changing behavior, 3) negative self-image and low behavioral control, and 4) all-or-nothing thinking about lifestyle change. Conclusions: The concept of dementia risk reduction seems difficult to translate to the personal context, particularly if individuals perceive that dementia would occur decades in the future. This is problematic because a large proportion of the public needs a healthier lifestyle to reduce the incidence of dementia. Translating healthy intentions into behavior is complex and involves overcoming a variety of barriers that complicate dementia risk reduction initiatives. Support is needed for individuals who experience additional obstacles that obstruct commencing to a healthier lifestyle (e.g., negative self-image, engaging in multiple unhealthy behaviors, unrealistic perceptions about lifestyle change).

N2 - Mathematical analysis of blast pressures has typically involved the empirical fitting of parametric models, which assumes a specific function shape. In reality, the true shape of the blast pressure is unknown and may lack a parametric form, particularly in the negative phase following arrival of the secondary shock. In this work, we develop a non-parametric (NP) representation that makes few assumptions and relies on the observed experimental data to fit a unique and previously unknown model. This differs from traditional approaches by not arbitrarily selecting a single, restrictive class of functions and estimating a minimal set of parameters, but rather estimating the underlying function class for which the blast pressure is generated; learning the model directly from the observed data. The method was applied to experimental blast measurements and the NP estimates matched the experimental data with a high degree of accuracy, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The NP approach was shown to significantly outperform other commonly used approaches, near-perfectly track the entire pressure and specific impulse history and predicting experimental peak specific impulse to within ±0.5% in all cases (compared to ±5.0% for a trained artificial neural network (ANN) and ±7.5% for the UFC semi-empirical approach). The NP approach predicts experimental net specific impulses (positive and negative phases combined) with a maximum variation of 2.7%, compared to maximum variations of −116% and 55% for the UFC and ANN approaches, respectively. Since the framework is probabilistic in nature, it can naturally account for random noise in sensor measurements, which are typically more pronounced in blast experiments than many other machine learning applications.

N2 - In the previous researches about the benchmark solutions in the irregular regions, there are some obvious shortcomings, such as small number of computational grids, simple computational domain, small characteristic number, and lack of mixed convection benchmark solution. In order to improve this situation, this article deeply studied the benchmark solutions for two-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer problems in the irregular regions under the body-fitted coordinate system. Taking the lid-driven flow, natural convection, and mixed convection problems as the research objects and considering the influence of boundary configurations of the computational domains, Reynolds number, Prandtl number, and Grashof number, this article designed three groups of test cases. The program code is first verified through employing the nonlinear multigrid method based on the collocated finite volume method and then the numerical solutions of three test cases with 1024 × 1024 grids and convergence criterion of 10−14 are obtained to get the benchmark solutions estimated by the Richardson extrapolation method.

N2 - Background: Mycetoma is a distinct body tissue destructive and neglected tropical disease. It is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries. Mycetoma is caused by bacterial infections (actinomycetoma) such as Streptomyces somaliensis and Nocardiae or true fungi (eumycetoma) such as Madurella mycetomatis. To date, treatments fail to cure the infection and the available marketed drugs are expensive and toxic upon prolonged usage. Moreover, no vaccine was prepared yet against mycetoma. Aim: The aim of this study is to predict effective epitope-based vaccine against fructose-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes of M. mycetomatis using immunoinformatics approaches. Methods and materials: Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase of M. mycetomatis sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the nominee’s epitopes in Immune Epitope Database for B-cell, T-cell MHC class II and class I. Then the proposed peptides were docked using Autodock 4.0 software program. Results and conclusions: The proposed and promising peptides KYLQ show a potent binding affinity to B-cell, FEYARKHAF with a very strong binding affinity to MHC I alleles and FFKEHGVPL that shows a very strong binding affinity to MHC II and MHC I alleles. This indicates a strong potential to formulate a new vaccine, especially with the peptide FFKEHGVPL which is likely to be the first proposed epitope-based vaccine against fructose-bisphosphate aldolase of M. mycetomatis. This study recommends an in vivo assessment for the most promising peptides especially FFKEHGVPL.

N2 - Evolutionary algorithms are metaheuristic algorithms that provide quasioptimal solutions in a reasonable time. They have been applied to many optimization problems in a high number of scientific areas. In this survey paper, we focus on the application of evolutionary algorithms to solve optimization problems related to a type of complex network like mobile multihop ad hoc networks. Since its origin, mobile multihop ad hoc network has evolved causing new types of multihop networks to appear such as vehicular ad hoc networks and delay tolerant networks, leading to the solution of new issues and optimization problems. In this survey, we review the main work presented for each type of mobile multihop ad hoc network and we also present some innovative ideas and open challenges to guide further research in this topic.

N2 - The aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) involves the complex interaction between a patient’s genetic predisposition, environment, gut microbiota and immune system. Currently, however, it is not known if the distinctive perturbations of the gut microbiota that appear to accompany both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are the cause of, or the result of, the intestinal inflammation that characterizes IBD. With the utilization of novel systems biology technologies, we can now begin to understand not only details about compositional changes in the gut microbiota in IBD, but increasingly also the alterations in microbiota function that accompany these. Technologies such as metagenomics, metataxomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metabonomics are therefore allowing us a deeper understanding of the role of the microbiota in IBD. Furthermore, the integration of these systems biology technologies through advancing computational and statistical techniques are beginning to understand the microbiome interactions that both contribute to health and diseased states in IBD. This review aims to explore how such systems biology technologies are advancing our understanding of the gut microbiota, and their potential role in delineating the aetiology, development and clinical care of IBD.

N2 - The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has not only accelerated findings on various novel non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species but also led to the revision of the biological significance and versatility of fundamental RNA species with canonical function, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Although tRNAs are best known as adapter components of translational machinery, recent studies suggest that tRNAs are not always end products but can further serve as a source for short ncRNAs. In many organisms, various tRNA-derived ncRNA species are produced from mature tRNAs or their precursor transcripts as functional molecules involved in various biological processes beyond translation. In this review, we focus on the tRNA-derived ncRNAs associated with Argonaute proteins and summarize recent studies on their conceivable biogenesis factors and on their emerging roles in gene expression regulation as regulatory RNAs.

N2 - Humans and non-human animals show great flexibility in spatial navigation, including the ability to return to specific locations based on as few as one single experience. To study spatial navigation in the laboratory, watermaze tasks, in which rats have to find a hidden platform in a pool of cloudy water surrounded by spatial cues, have long been used. Analogous tasks have been developed for human participants using virtual environments. Spatial learning in the watermaze is facilitated by the hippocampus. In particular, rapid, one-trial, allocentric place learning, as measured in the delayed-matching-to-place variant of the watermaze task, which requires rodents to learn repeatedly new locations in a familiar environment, is hippocampal dependent. In this article, we review some computational principles, embedded within a reinforcement learning framework, that utilise hippocampal spatial representations for navigation in watermaze tasks. We consider which key elements underlie their efficacy, and discuss their limitations in accounting for hippocampus-dependent navigation, both in terms of behavioural performance (i.e. how well do they reproduce behavioural measures of rapid place learning) and neurobiological realism (i.e. how well do they map to neurobiological substrates involved in rapid place learning). We discuss how an actor–critic architecture, enabling simultaneous assessment of the value of the current location and of the optimal direction to follow, can reproduce one-trial place learning performance as shown on watermaze and virtual delayed-matching-to-place tasks by rats and humans, respectively, if complemented with map-like place representations. The contribution of actor–critic mechanisms to delayed-matching-to-place performance is consistent with neurobiological findings implicating the striatum and hippocampo-striatal interaction in delayed-matching-to-place performance, given that the striatum has been associated with actor–critic mechanisms. Moreover, we illustrate that hierarchical computations embedded within an actor–critic architecture may help to account for aspects of flexible spatial navigation. The hierarchical reinforcement learning approach separates trajectory control via a temporal-difference error from goal selection via a goal prediction error and may account for flexible, trial-specific, navigation to familiar goal locations, as required in some arm-maze place memory tasks, although it does not capture one-trial learning of new goal locations, as observed in open field, including watermaze and virtual, delayed-matching-to-place tasks. Future models of one-shot learning of new goal locations, as observed on delayed-matching-to-place tasks, should incorporate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that integrate new goal information with allocentric place representation, as such mechanisms are supported by substantial empirical evidence.

N2 - The main purpose of this paper is to explore the importance of external flow field circulation of hydraulic torque converter assembly in analysis. Compared with simply considering the internal flow field characteristics, it has influence on the internal flow field analysis, external characteristics and structural stress of hydraulic torque converter assembly. This paper models the flow path of the torque converter with different Schemes, the flow field pressures distribution on the impeller are analysed using computational fluid dynamics method (CFD). Scheme A adopts the traditional idea, which simply considering the influence of internal flow field on the performance. Scheme B contacts the external flow field especially including the auxiliary cavity, and comprehensively studies the influence of it on the performance. The results show that with the addition of an auxiliary chamber, the overall flow field pressure of the torque converter is lower than that without the auxiliary chamber. The external characteristics of the torque converter assembly were tested on experiment equipment, which has been verified that the CFD simulation results with the addition of the auxiliary chamber are closer to the experiment data, proving the accuracy of the method for the pressure simulation of flow field. On this basis, the stresses and deformations of the torque converter considering the auxiliary fluid chamber are compared and analysed in relation to the displacement limitations of the impellers. The results show that the maximum stress in the turbine is reduced by 57%–12% compared to the scheme A without considering the auxiliary fluid. In the case of special operating condition, the maximum stress was 137.06 MPa before considering the auxiliary fluid, while the maximum stress was 60.625 MPa after considering the auxiliary fluid, and the reduction is 57%. The effects of input speed, speed ratio and impeller structure on the stress and deformation were also analysed, and the results show that the impeller structure and input speed have a great influence on the stress and deformation.
