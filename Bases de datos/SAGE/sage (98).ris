N2 - In order to reveal the gas–liquid two-phase flow pattern of inverted-umbrella aerator, the high-speed photography technology, particle image velocimetry, and Volume of Fluid model are employed to capture the free-surface dynamics and velocity distribution. The Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are validated by experimental data and the results are in good agreement with experiment. The simulation results of flow field, streamline distribution, velocity distribution, free-surface deformation, and turbulence kinetic energy are analyzed at in time and at radial profiles sampled at several vertical positions. Back surface of each blade revealed the area of low-pressure, which can drag air into water directly from surface and thus enhance liquid aeration and oxygenation capacity. Lifting capacity of the inverted-umbrella aerator is enough to get the liquid at the bottom of the aeration tank accelerated toward liquid surface generating the hydraulic jump. As a result, liquid phase splashes capture portions of air promoting aeration of the solution. A clear circulation whirlpool is formed during the process. The circulation whirlpool starts at the bottom of the impeller moving upward along the plate until the outer edge of the impeller, which is close to the free surface. The circulation whirlpool indicates that the inverted-umbrella aerator plays a significant role in shallow aeration. The turbulence intensity created by the impeller gradually reduces with depth. The position (z = 0.65 H) is the watershed in the tank. The oxygen mass transfer mainly occurs in the layer above watershed.

N2 - β-lapachone is a naturally occurring 1,2-naphthoquinone-based compound that has been advanced into clinical trials based on its tumor-selective cytotoxic properties. Previously, we focused on the related 1,4-naphthoquinone pharmacophore as a basic core structure for developing a series of potent indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme inhibitors. In this study, we identified IDO1 inhibitory activity as a previously unrecognized attribute of the clinical candidate β-lapachone. Enzyme kinetics-based analysis of β-lapachone indicated an uncompetitive mode of inhibition, while computational modeling predicted binding within the IDO1 active site consistent with other naphthoquinone derivatives. Inhibition of IDO1 has previously been shown to breach the pathogenic tolerization that constrains the immune system from being able to mount an effective anti-tumor response. Thus, the finding that β-lapachone has IDO1 inhibitory activity adds a new dimension to its potential utility as an anti-cancer agent distinct from its cytotoxic properties, and suggests that a synergistic benefit can be achieved from its combined cytotoxic and immunologic effects.

N2 - Human reasoning goes beyond knowledge about individual entities, extending to inferences based on relations between entities. Here we focus on the use of relations in verbal analogical mapping, sketching a general approach based on assessing similarity between patterns of semantic relations between words. This approach combines research in artificial intelligence with work in psychology and cognitive science, with the aim of minimizing hand coding of text inputs for reasoning tasks. The computational framework takes as inputs vector representations of individual word meanings, coupled with semantic representations of the relations between words, and uses these inputs to form semantic-relation networks for individual analogues. Analogical mapping is operationalized as graph matching under cognitive and computational constraints. The approach highlights the central role of semantics in analogical mapping.

N2 - Aero-servo-elastic analysis of a complex hypersonic aircraft is presented in this paper. A structure geometry was designed and built based on the X-43A vehicle. First, a three-dimensional structural finite element model was proposed with effective two-dimensional elements, which can obtain effective modal analysis results without useless local modes. Second, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation was adopted to find aero-heating distribution of thermal mode via this structure. Aero-heating effect was included to study thermal-modal characteristics of the present structure. Influence due to material characteristic change and thermal stress was studied. After structural finite element analysis was completed, flutter of the present vehicle was investigated. Aero-servo-elastic analysis was then started from the definition of an aero-servo-elastic closed-loop system. In this system, the present aircraft is treated as flexible structure, in which the control sensor on the aircraft received not only rigid motion signal but also elastic vibration signal, and this signal can translate into the deflection signal to form aerodynamic control force through this aero-servo control system, and this force can continually influence aerodynamic force. One of the most important steps for this analysis was computation of unsteady aerodynamic force of the present structure, and the related process was developed based on an effective fitting method. Finally, bode diagrams of pitching, rolling and yawing were investigated, form which the law of aero-servo stability of the X-43A vehicle can be observed and analyzed. It can be found from the results of this paper that effective investigation of aero-servo-elastic characteristics of a complex hypersonic aircraft should be based on accurate structural finite element modeling, modal analysis and flutter analysis. The proposed method in this paper can provide effective analysis process for the design of controller for hypersonic aircraft.

N2 - This work examines the second law analysis of an electrically conducting reactive third-grade fluid flow embedded with the porous medium in a microchannel with the influence of variable thermal conductivity, activation energy, viscous dissipation, joule heating, and radiative heat flux. A suitable non-dimensional variable is included into the governing equations to transform them into an ensemble of equations that are devoid of dimensions. The acquired equations are then tackled using the Runge Kutta Felhberg 4th and 5th order (RKF-45) approach in conjunction with the shooting methodology. Through comparison with the current results, the numerical results are verified, which provides a good agreement. From the present outcomes, it is established that the entropy generation is supreme for the viscous heating constraint, variable thermal conductivity, Frank Kameneski, heat source ratio parameter and third-grade fluid material constraint. The Bejan number boosts up with larger values of activation energy, and Frank Kameneski constraint and the decreasing nature is noticed for increasing third-grade material parameter, viscous heating parameter. With magnetism, the fluid’s velocity slows down because of a resistive force. A similar impact in the channel on velocity is noticed for larger third-grade fluid, activation energy parameter, and Frank-Kameniski parameters and increasing behavior is noticed for variable thermal conductivity, and permeability parameter. Further, it is cleared that the variable thermal conductivity assumption in the channel plate leads to a significant under prediction of the irreversibility rate.

N2 - This article turns towards the spatial life of ‘digital infrastructures’, i.e. code, protocols, standards, and data formats that are hidden from view in everyday applications of computational technologies. It does so by drawing on the version control system Git as a case study, and telling the story of its initial development in order to reconstruct the circumstances and technical considerations surrounding its conception. This account engages with computational infrastructures on their own terms by adopting the figure of the ‘stack’ to frame a technically informed analysis, and exploring its implications for a different kind of geographic inquiry. Drawing on topology as employed by Law and Mol, attention is given to the multiplicity of spatialities and temporalities enrolled in digital infrastructures in general, and Git specifically. Along the lines of the case study and by reading it against other literatures, this notion of topology is expanded to include the material performation of fundamentally arbitrary, more-than-human topologies, as well as their nested articulation, translation and negotiation within digital infrastructures.

N2 - Compared with a drag-type vertical axis wind turbines, one of the greatest advantages for a lift-type vertical axis wind turbines is its higher power coefficient (Cp). However, the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines is not a self-starting turbine as its starting torque is very low. In order to combine the advantage of both the drag-type and the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines, a lift drag hybrid vertical axis wind turbines was designed in this article and its aerodynamics and starting performance was studied in detail with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Numerical results indicate that the power coefficient of this lift drag hybrid vertical axis wind turbines declines when the distance between its drag-type blades and the center of rotation of the turbine rotor increases, whereas its starting torque can be significantly improved. Studies also show that unlike the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines, this lift drag hybrid-type vertical axis wind turbines could be able to solve the problem of low start-up torque. However, the installation position of the drag blade is very important. If the drag blade is mounted very close to the spindle, the starting torque of the lift drag hybrid-type vertical axis wind turbines may not be improved at all. In addition, it has been found that the power coefficient of the studied vertical axis wind turbines is not as good as expected and possible reasons have been provided in this article after the pressure distribution along the surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades of the hybrid turbine was analyzed.

N2 - Numerical simulations were performed in this paper to investigate an elastically mounted circular cylinder subjected to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). A three-step finite element method (FEM) is introduced for solving the incompressible fluid flow equations in two dimensions. The computational procedure is coupled with a mesh movement scheme by use of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation on account of the body motion in the flow field. On running the numerical simulations, the Reynolds number was kept constant of Re = 100 and the reduced velocity = U/(D) was varied from 3.0 to 10.2 by changing the natural frequency of the cylinder. The mass ratio m* = 4m/ρπD2 and damping ratio ξ are set to be 10.0 and 0.01, respectively, where U is free-stream velocity, D the diameter of the circular cylinder, m the mass of the cylinder per unit length, and ρ the density of the fluid. Numerical results are examined for the response amplitude of transverse direction as well as the phase angle, φ, between the lift force and the transverse displacement of the cylinder. The numerical results reveal that the transverse amplitudes present only two branches, namely, initial branch and lower branch, rather than three branches as the results obtained from high-Re experiments with low m∗ξ. On the other hand, the phase angles present almost linear increase with the reduced velocity in the synchronization region. However, experiments concerned with high Re exhibit a sudden jump in phase angle of approximate . The difference between the present study and the high-Re experiment is attributed to no substantial vortex shedding mode transition at the present numerical results of laminar flow.

N2 - The legitimacy of public broadcasting has been under pressure for several decades. Attempts to repair and restore this legitimacy have led to an intensification of accountability instruments and measures. These instruments and measures tend to focus on consumption figures or cost-benefit analyses, requiring new ways of capturing public value. This article argues that, given the media’s persistent role as an interpreter and multiplier of news via traditional distribution channels and diverse new platforms providing information and opinions, professional follow-up communication is a relevant source for the examination of broadcasters’ contributions to public debate. The essay explores how the analysis of newspapers via computational methods can be used by public broadcasters to reflect on and demonstrate their role in public debates in contributing a diversity of topics and viewpoints.

N2 - We propose a flexible and scalable approximate Bayesian inference methodology for the Cox Proportional Hazards model with partial likelihood. The model we consider includes nonlinear covariate effects and correlated survival times. The proposed method is based on nested approximations and adaptive quadrature, and the computational burden of working with the log-partial likelihood is mitigated through automatic differentiation and Laplace approximation. We provide two simulation studies to show the accuracy of the proposed approach, compared with the existing methods. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method and its computational advantages over Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods through the analysis of Kidney infection times, which are paired, and the analysis of Leukemia survival times with a semi-parametric covariate effect and spatial variation.
