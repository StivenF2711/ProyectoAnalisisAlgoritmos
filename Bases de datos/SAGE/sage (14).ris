N2 - Objectives: In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, the emergence of therapeutic failures with existing antiretroviral drugs presents a significant challenge. This study aims to employ advanced molecular modeling techniques to identify potential alternatives to current antiretroviral agents. Methods: The study focuses on three essential classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Computational analyses were performed on a database of 3,343,652 chemical molecules to evaluate their binding affinities, pharmacokinetic properties, and interactions with viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling were utilized to identify promising candidates. Results: Molecular docking revealed compounds with high binding energies and strong interactions at the active sites of target enzymes. Virtual screening narrowed down potential candidates with favorable pharmacological profiles. 3D pharmacophore modeling identified crucial structural features for effective binding. Overall, two molecules for class 1, 7 molecules for class 2, and 2 molecules for class 3 were selected. These compounds exhibited robust binding affinities, interactions with target enzymes, and improved pharmacokinetic properties, showing promise for more effective HIV treatments in cases of therapeutic failures. Conclusion: The combination of molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling yielded lead compounds that hold potential for addressing HIV therapeutic failures. Further experimental investigations are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of these compounds, with the ultimate goal of advancing toward clinical applications in HIV management.

N2 - Pultrusion is a continuous manufacturing process used to produce high strength composite profiles with constant cross section. The mutual interactions between heat transfer, resin flow and cure reaction, variation in the material properties, and stress/distortion evolutions strongly affect the process dynamics together with the mechanical properties and the geometrical precision of the final product. In the present work, pultrusion process simulations are performed for a unidirectional (UD) graphite/epoxy composite rod including several processing physics, such as fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reaction, and solid mechanics. The pressure increase and the resin flow at the tapered inlet of the die are calculated by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) finite volume model. Several models, based on different homogenization levels and solution schemes, are proposed and compared for the evaluation of the temperature and the degree of cure distributions inside the heating die and at the postdie region. The transient stresses, distortions, and pull force are predicted using a sequentially coupled three-dimensional (3D) thermochemical analysis together with a 2D plane strain mechanical analysis using the finite element method and compared with results obtained from a semianalytical approach.

N2 - The effects of different loading programs on the elasto-/viscoplastic behavior of rate-sensitive materials are analyzed with specific numerical examples. An appropriate solution scheme and a consistent tangent operator are applied which are capable of being adopted for general computational procedures. Numerical computations and results are reported which illustrate the rate-dependence of the elasto-/viscoplastic constitutive model in use. In the numerical analysis the loading is applied by increasing the pressure and accordingly a nondimensional loading program parameter is introduced. In the numerical results the significance of the loading program is thus emphasized with reference to the nonlinear response of the elasto-/viscoplastic material behavior of solids.

N2 - The ambition and proposal for data modeling of myths presented in this paper is to link contemporary technical affordances to some canonical projects developed in structural anthropology. To articulate the theoretical promise and innovation of this proposal, we present a discrete-event system specification modeling and simulation approach in order to perform a generative analysis and a dynamic visualization of selected narratives, aimed at validating and revitalizing the transformational and morphodynamic theory and methodology proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss in his structural analysis of myth. After an analysis of Lévi-Strauss’s transformational methodology, we describe in detail how discrete-event system specification models are implemented and developed in the framework of a DEVSimPy software environment. The validation of the method involves a discrete-event system specification simulation based on the extension of discrete-event system specification models dedicated to provide a dynamic Google Earth visualization of the selected myth. Future work around the discrete-event system specification formalism in anthropology is described as well as future applications regarding the impact of computational models (discrete-event system specification formalism, Bayesian inferences, and object-oriented features) to new contemporary anthropological domains.

N2 - We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.

N2 - Feminist thinking has contributed to changing views of women in society and in leadership positions. Yet women are still underrepresented in leadership, especially in key roles and at higher organizational ranks. In this commentary we examine the past, present, and future of leadership theories through a gendered lens, by considering them against the backdrop of feminist theory evolution. We first organize existing leadership theories according to four main feminist waves—gender reform feminism or “fixing the women” which corresponds with liberal feminism; gender resistance feminism or “the female advantage,” reflecting radical feminism; the gender rebellion feminism or “how is a wo(man) defined,” according to postmodern and intersectionality theories, and gender digital feminism or “hashtag and clicktivism revolution” that focuses on social media, cyber activism, sexual violence, and complex intersectionality. We further examine the implications and research findings of these theories for women and men in leadership. Second, we review the publications on gender and leadership in two exemplary journals publishing leadership research in the field between 2019 and 2022 and explore to which feminist wave the published works relate. We show that themes related to the first two waves of feminist thinking continue to be dominant in current leadership research and encourage moving into new terrains, utilizing current feminist thinking, in the study of leadership and gender. Finally, we raise awareness that in a gendered society, leadership theories may reproduce and reconstruct the existing social order and gendered arrangements, as well as map novel directions for future research.

N2 - Contemporary artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes address deep-seated existential challenges and modes of desire. In so doing, they produce computational systems of imagination, an “algorithmic as if” that enables the expression, transformation, and seeming overcoming of existential limitations via technological means. This article elaborates the character of the “algorithmic as if” by focusing on Deep Nostalgia, an online tool that turns personal photographs of the deceased into looped animations which smile, blink, and move, promising to overcome mortality by technologically “resurrecting the dead.” Performing a close-reading of Deep Nostalgia’s technological processes and the public discourse around its 2021 launch, the article highlights its combination of computational learning, forms of visual representation (photography, video, and animation), and distinctive realignments of temporal experience. Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.

N2 - The blood pump is an implantable device with strict performance requirements. Any effective structural improvement will help to improve the treatment of patients. However, the research of blood pump structure improvement is a complex optimization problem with multiple parameters and objectives. This study takes the splitter blade as the object of structural improvement. Computational fluid mechanics and neural networks are combined in research and optimization. And hydraulic experiments and micro particle image velocimetry technology were used. In the optimization study, the number of blades, axial length and circumferential offset are optimization parameters, and hydraulic performance and hemolytic prediction index are optimization targets. The study analyzes the influence of each parameter on performance and completes the optimization of the parameters. In the results, the optimal parameters of number of blades, axial length ratio, and circumferential offset are 2.6° and 0.41°, respectively. Under optimized parameters, hydraulic performance can be significantly improved. And the results of hemolysis prediction and micro particle image velocimetry experiments reflect that there is no increase in the risk of hemolytic damage. The results of this study provide a method and ideas for improving the structure of the axial spiral blade blood pump. The established optimization method can be effectively applied to the design and research of axial spiral blade blood pumps with complex, high precision, and multiple parameters and targets.

N2 - The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years. They have inflicted heavy casualties and property losses. Hence, it is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Then, some technologies, including cyber-physical system, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking as a broader vision of the Internet of Things was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this article, a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system is developed in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via cyber-physical system and Internet of Things are analyzed. Moreover, to show the efficiency of proposed method, two application cases are provided during the cyber-physical-social-thinking modeling and computing for geological information service system.
