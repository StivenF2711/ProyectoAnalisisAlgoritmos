N2 - Objectives: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) efficacy is jeopardized by the emergence of drug resistance mutations in HIV, compromising treatment effectiveness. This study aims to propose novel analogs of Effavirenz (EFV) as potential direct inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase, employing computer-aided drug design methodologies. Methods: Three key approaches were applied: a mutational profile study, molecular dynamics simulations, and pharmacophore development. The impact of mutations on the stability, flexibility, function, and affinity of target proteins, especially those associated with NRTI, was assessed. Molecular dynamics analysis identified G190E as a mutation significantly altering protein properties, potentially leading to therapeutic failure. Comparative analysis revealed that among six first-line antiretroviral drugs, EFV exhibited notably low affinity with viral reverse transcriptase, further reduced by the G190E mutation. Subsequently, a search for EFV-similar inhibitors yielded 12 promising molecules based on their affinity, forming the basis for generating a pharmacophore model. Results: Mutational analysis pinpointed G190E as a crucial mutation impacting protein properties, potentially undermining therapeutic efficacy. EFV demonstrated diminished affinity with viral reverse transcriptase, exacerbated by the G190E mutation. The search for EFV analogs identified 12 high-affinity molecules, culminating in a pharmacophore model elucidating key structural features crucial for potent inhibition. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of EFV analogs as potential inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. The findings highlight the impact of mutations on drug efficacy, particularly the detrimental effect of G190E. The generated pharmacophore model serves as a pivotal reference for future drug development efforts targeting HIV, providing essential structural insights for the design of potent inhibitors based on EFV analogs identified in vitro.

N2 - Motivation: The precise diagnosis of the major subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, of non-small-cell lung cancer is of practical importance as some treatments are subtype-specific. However, in some cases diagnosis via the commonly-used method, that is staining the specimen using immunohistochemical markers, may be challenging. Hence, having a computational method that complements the diagnosis is desirable. In this paper, we propose a gene signature for this purpose. Results: We developed an expression-based method that systematically suggests a huge set of candidate gene signatures and finds the best candidate. By applying this method to a training set, the optimal gene signature was found by considering close to 765 billion candidate signatures. The 8-gene signature found for classifying the 2 aforementioned subtypes comprises TP63, CALML3, KRT5, PKP1, TESC, SPINK1, C9orf152, and KRT7. The signature achieved a high overall prediction accuracy of 0.936 when tested using 34 independent gene expression datasets obtained using different technologies and comprising 2556 adenocarcinoma and 1630 squamous cell carcinoma samples. Additionally, the signature performed well in clinically challenging cases, that is poorly differentiated tumors and specimens obtained from biopsies. In comparison with 2 previously reported signatures, our signature performed better in terms of overall accuracy and especially accuracy of classifying lung squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: Our signature is easy to use and accurate regardless of the technology used to obtain the gene expression profiles. It performs well even in clinically challenging cases and thus can assist pathologists in diagnosis of the ambiguous cases.

N2 - Coupled dynamic analysis of a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is predicted with in-house ITU-WAVE computational tool. The hydrodynamic parameters are approximated with time marching of boundary integral equation whilst aerodynamic parameters are solved with unsteady blade element momentum method. In addition, forces on FOWT due to mooring lines are predicted with quasi-static analysis whilst hydrodynamic viscous effects are included with Morison equation. FOWT’s blades are considered as an elastic structure whilst tower is considered as a rigid structure. The effects of steady wind speed on surge motion spectrum decrease the spectrum amplitude over wave frequency ranges, but this effect is not significant. The duration of time domain simulation plays significant role in the region of surge and pitch resonant frequencies. The numerical results of in-house ITU-WAVE computational code for eigenfrequencies of blades, aerodynamics and hydrodynamics parameters are validated against other numerical results which shows satisfactory agreements.

N2 - We offer a new perspective on how cultural markets are structured and the conditions under which innovations are more likely to emerge. We argue that in addition to organization- and producer-level factors, product features—the locus of marketplace interaction between producers and consumers—also structure markets. The aggregated distribution of product features helps producers gauge where to differentiate or conform and when consumers may be more receptive to the kind of novelty that spawns new genres, our measure of innovation. We test our arguments with a unique dataset comprising the nearly 25,000 songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from 1958 to 2016, using computational methods to capture and analyze the aesthetic (sonic) and semantic (lyrical) features of each song and, consequently, the market for popular music. Results reveal that new genres are more likely to appear following markets that can be characterized as diverse along one feature dimension while homogenous along the other. We then connect specific configurations of feature distributions to subsequent song novelty before linking the aesthetic and semantic novelty of individual songs to genre emergence. We replicate our findings using industry-wide data and conclude with implications for the study of markets and innovation.

N2 - A fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) concept is demonstrated as a promising method to achieve high efficiency – clean combustion. Engine experiments were performed in a heavy-duty test engine over a range of loads. Additionally, RCCI engine experiments were compared to conventional diesel engine experiments. Detailed computational fluid dynamics modelling was then used to explain the experimentally observed trends. Specifically, it was found that RCCI combustion is capable of operating over a wide range of engine loads with near zero levels of NOx and soot, acceptable pressure rise rate and ringing intensity, and very high indicated efficiency. For example, a peak gross indicated efficiency of 56 per cent was observed at 9.3 bar indicated mean effective pressure and 1300 rev/min. The comparison between RCCI and conventional diesel showed a reduction in NOx by three orders of magnitude, a reduction in soot by a factor of six, and an increase in gross indicated efficiency of 16.4 per cent (i.e. 7.9 per cent more of the fuel energy was converted to useful work). The simulation results showed that the improvement in fuel conversion efficiency was due both to reductions in heat transfer losses and improved control over the start- and end-of-combustion.

N2 - Social media channels, particularly Twitter/X, played a significant role as information platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. As journalists are crucial actors on that platform, an analysis of the content and tone of their tweets during the pandemic can reveal the role they played in shaping public understanding of this public health crisis. Our analysis focuses on Germany where the government enforced relatively strict anti-COVID-19 measures and where strong opposition to these measures emerged outside the mainstream media. We analyzed almost 10.000 tweets of 247 journalists of mainstream media during a 14-month-period. To shed light on journalists’ watchdog versus collaborative role orientation, computational methods were used to extract themes and tone in their pandemic-related tweets. Furthermore, network analysis was utilized to identify influential actors in journalists’ interactions with experts and other users on Twitter. The findings revealed that journalists tweeted most about topics like the economy, protests, and Chancellor Merkel’s ability to implement a restrictive containment policy. As demonstrated by the network analysis, journalists frequently interacted with cabinet members and pro-government experts on Twitter during the pandemic. The analysis also revealed that some tweets were characterized by an anti-protest and anti-lockdown tone, but these came from different groups of journalists.

N2 - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major malignancy in the liver and has emerged as one of the main cancers in the world with a high mortality rate. However, the molecular mechanisms of HCC are still poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently come to the forefront as functional non–protein-coding RNAs that are involved in a variety of cellular processes ranging from maintaining the structural integrity of chromosomes to gene expression regulation in a spatiotemporal manner. Many recent studies have reported the involvement of lncRNAs in HCC which has led to a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms operating in HCC. Long noncoding RNAs have been shown to regulate development and progression of HCC, and thus, lncRNAs have both diagnostic and therapeutic potentials. In this review, we present an overview of the lncRNAs involved in different stages of HCC and their potential in clinical applications which have been studied so far.

N2 - The design of underwater unmanned vehicles is an interdisciplinary study that includes several fields, such as computational fluid dynamics, modeling and control of systems, robotics, image processing, and electronic card design. The operational cost of such vehicles is high because it is dependent on variable fluid properties like salinity and high pressure while its’ mobility must be resistant to environmental conditions such as undersea. The study describes an operating platform, called Lucky Fin, on which the students can develop various control algorithms and can test and extract hydrodynamic parameters of the underwater vehicle. The platform consists of an underwater vehicle and two testing tanks. The control card, the user control program interface, and a manipulator’s arm are designed to be used for a series of control applications such as depth, heading, target tracking, and capturing. The results of several tests are illustrated in this article.

N2 - Contamination of water by ciprofloxacin has become a significant concern due to its adverse health effects and growing evidence of antimicrobial-resistant gene evolution. To this end, a chemically modified bamboo biochar was prepared from bamboo sawdust to effectively remove ciprofloxacin (CIP) from an aqueous solution. Under similar adsorption conditions, the modified bamboo biochar (MBC) has an excellent CIP removal efficiency (96%) compared to unmodified bamboo biochar (UBC) efficiency (45%). Thus, MBC was used in batch adsorption experiments, and the process was optimized with the central composite design (CCD) framework of response surface methodology (RSM). Sorption process parameters such as initial CIP concentration, pH, adsorbent dose, and contact time were studied and found to have a significant effect on CIP removal. The optimal CIP removal (96%) was obtained at MBC dose (0.5 g L-1), CIP initial concentration (20 mg L-1), pH (7.5), and contact time (46 min). The adsorption kinetic data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model , and both Langmuir and Freundlich models gave the best fit in CIP adsorption isotherm analysis. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the MBC was 78.43 mg g-1 based on the Langmuir isotherm model. These results suggest that CIP adsorption was mainly controlled by chemisorption. Moreover, the CIP adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Overall, MBC is a low-cost, efficient, and recyclable adsorbent for eliminating emerging contaminants such as ciprofloxacin from an aqueous solution.

N2 - Scientific workflows can be understood as arrangements of managed activities executed by different processing entities. It is a regular Bioinformatics approach applying workflows to solve problems in Molecular Biology, notably those related to sequence analyses. Due to the nature of the raw data and the in silico environment of Molecular Biology experiments, apart from the research subject, 2 practical and closely related problems have been studied: reproducibility and computational environment. When aiming to enhance the reproducibility of Bioinformatics experiments, various aspects should be considered. The reproducibility requirements comprise the data provenance, which enables the acquisition of knowledge about the trajectory of data over a defined workflow, the settings of the programs, and the entire computational environment. Cloud computing is a booming alternative that can provide this computational environment, hiding technical details, and delivering a more affordable, accessible, and configurable on-demand environment for researchers. Considering this specific scenario, we proposed a solution to improve the reproducibility of Bioinformatics workflows in a cloud computing environment using both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Not only SQL (NoSQL) database systems. To meet the goal, we have built 3 typical Bioinformatics workflows and ran them on 1 private and 2 public clouds, using different types of NoSQL database systems to persist the provenance data according to the Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM). We present here the results and a guide for the deployment of a cloud environment for Bioinformatics exploring the characteristics of various NoSQL database systems to persist provenance data.
