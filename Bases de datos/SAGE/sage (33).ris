N2 - Little is known about Voluntary Assisted Partner Notification (VAPN) in groups in sub-Saharan Africa that experience marginalisation, and whether its use is suitable for referral to HIV care pathways. We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with purposively selected medical and health professionals (N = 15) regarding their perspectives and experiences with VAPN policy and its implementation. Data were analysed following a Reflexive Thematic Analysis approach. Respondents highlighted the flexibility in VAPN policy implementation and described adjustments made by health workers. Women were seen as vulnerable and lacked access to support against gender-based violence. Men who have sex with men could face exclusion from important social networks. Age-appropriate VAPN assistance was also considered unavailable for sexually active children. Embedding understandings of identity, belonging, and safety into VAPN could address individual priorities and needs. Community support networks, tailored care for children, and family-orientated approaches to HIV notification may overcome issues relating to vulnerability and marginalisation.

N2 - It is essential to measure within-country differences in housing costs in order to evaluate costs of living, assessing and comparing poverty levels, quantifying salaries and disposable income of families and finally for designing housing policies at local level. To the authors knowledge, no studies have yet been carried out on the computation of Space Price Indexes for Housing Rents (SPIHRs). In this article we computed preliminary estimates of sub-national SPIHRs by using hedonic regression model, which is an extension of the Country Product Dummy method, for all the Italian regions. The hedonic regression is generally used to obtain multilateral spatial indexes, thus allowing us to obtain multilateral SPIHRs for the Italian regions. The estimates have been done using 2017 data from the Real Estate Market Observatory which is a part of the Italian Agency of Revenue and Tax. This data source is the most comprehensive source of information on Italian houses price rents with a wide geographical coverage, including data for each Italian municipality. The obtained results show significant differences across the Italian regions, thus highlighting the importance of calculating SPIHR in Italy on a regular basis and the need to continue researches in this field.

N2 - As technology advances, architects often employ innovative, non-standard shapes in their designs for the fast-growing number of high-rise buildings. Conversely, climate change is bringing about an increasing number of dangerous wind events causing damage to buildings and their surroundings. These factors further complicate the already difficult field of structural wind analysis. Current methods for calculating structural wind response, such as the Eurocode, do not provide methods for unconventional building shapes or, in the case of physical wind tunnel test and in-depth computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, they are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Thus, wind load analysis is often relegated to late in the design process. This paper presents the development of a computational method to analyze the effect of wind on the structural behavior of a 3D building model and optimize the external geometry to reduce those effects at an early design phase. It combines CFD, finite-element analysis (FEA), and an optimization algorithm in the popular parametric design tool, Grasshopper. This allows it to be used in an early design stage for performance-based design exploration in complement to the more traditional late-stage methods outlined above. After developing the method and testing the timeliness and precision of the CFD, and FEA portions on case study buildings, the tool was able to output an optimal geometry as well as a database of improved geometric options with their corresponding performance for the wind loading.

N2 - Alterations of mismatch responses (ie, neural activity evoked by unexpected stimuli) are often considered a potential biomarker of schizophrenia. Going beyond establishing the type of observed alterations found in diagnosed patients and related cohorts, computational methods can yield valuable insights into the underlying disruptions of neural mechanisms and cognitive function. Here, we adopt a typology of model-based approaches from computational cognitive neuroscience, providing an overview of the study of mismatch responses and their alterations in schizophrenia from four complementary perspectives: (a) connectivity models, (b) decoding models, (c) neural network models, and (d) cognitive models. Connectivity models aim at inferring the effective connectivity patterns between brain regions that may underlie mismatch responses measured at the sensor level. Decoding models use multivariate spatiotemporal mismatch response patterns to infer the type of sensory violations or to classify participants based on their diagnosis. Neural network models such as deep convolutional neural networks can be used for improved classification performance as well as for a systematic study of various aspects of empirical data. Finally, cognitive models quantify mismatch responses in terms of signaling and updating perceptual predictions over time. In addition to describing the available methodology and reviewing the results of recent computational psychiatry studies, we offer suggestions for future work applying model-based techniques to advance the study of mismatch responses in schizophrenia.

N2 - There is a driving need computationally to interrogate large bodies of text for a range of non-denotative meaning (e.g., to plot chains of reasoning, detect sentiment, diagnose genre, and so forth). But such meaning has always proven computationally allusive. It is often implicit, ‘hidden’ meaning, evoked by linguistic cues, stylistic arrangement, or conceptual structure – features that have hitherto been difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to recognize and use. Non-denotative textual effects are the historical concern of rhetorical studies, and we have turned to rhetoric in order to find new ways to advance NLP, especially for sophisticated tasks like Argument Mining. This paper highlights certain rhetorical devices that encode levels of meaning that have been overlooked in Computational Linguistics generally and Argument Mining particularly, and yet lend themselves to automated detection. These devices are the linguistic configurations known as Rhetorical Figures. We argue for the importance of these devices for Argument Mining, especially in collocations, and we present an XML annotation scheme for Rhetorical Figures to make figuration more tractable for computational approaches, particularly with an eye on the improvements they offer Argument Mining. We also discuss the intellectual and technical challenges involved in figure annotation and the implications for Machine Learning.

N2 - A phylogenetic tree is a visual diagram of the relationship between a set of biological species. The scientists usually use it to analyze many characteristics of the species. The distance-matrix methods, such as Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean and Neighbor Joining, construct a phylogenetic tree by calculating pairwise genetic distances between taxa. These methods have the computational performance issue. Although several new methods with high-performance hardware and frameworks have been proposed, the issue still exists. In this work, a novel parallel Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean approach on multiple Graphics Processing Units is proposed to construct a phylogenetic tree from extremely large set of sequences. The experimental results present that the proposed approach on a DGX-1 server with 8 NVIDIA P100 graphic cards achieves approximately 3-fold to 7-fold speedup over the implementation of Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean on a modern CPU and a single GPU, respectively.

N2 - Genome biology approaches have made enormous contributions to our understanding of biological rhythms, particularly in identifying outputs of the clock, including RNAs, proteins, and metabolites, whose abundance oscillates throughout the day. These methods hold significant promise for future discovery, particularly when combined with computational modeling. However, genome-scale experiments are costly and laborious, yielding “big data” that are conceptually and statistically difficult to analyze. There is no obvious consensus regarding design or analysis. Here we discuss the relevant technical considerations to generate reproducible, statistically sound, and broadly useful genome-scale data. Rather than suggest a set of rigid rules, we aim to codify principles by which investigators, reviewers, and readers of the primary literature can evaluate the suitability of different experimental designs for measuring different aspects of biological rhythms. We introduce CircaInSilico, a web-based application for generating synthetic genome biology data to benchmark statistical methods for studying biological rhythms. Finally, we discuss several unmet analytical needs, including applications to clinical medicine, and suggest productive avenues to address them.

N2 - Political theory as a discipline has long been skeptical of computational methods. In this paper, I argue that it is time for theory to make a perspectival shift on these methods. Specifically, we should consider integrating recently developed generative large language models like GPT-4 as tools to support our creative work as theorists. Ultimately, I suggest that political theorists should embrace this technology as a method of supporting our capacity for creativity—but that we should do so in a way that is mindful of the content and value of theorizing, the technical constraints of the models, and the ethical questions that the technology raises.

N2 - Some complex problems in science and engineering are modeled using fuzzy differential equations. Many fuzzy differential equations cannot be solved by using exact techniques because of the complexity of the problems mentioned. We utilize analytical techniques to solve a system of fuzzy differential equations because they are simple to use and frequently result in closed-form solutions. The Generalized Modified Adomian Decomposition Method is developed in this article to compute the analytical solution to the linear system of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy initial value problems. The starting values in this case are thought of as intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers. Engineering examples, such as the Brine Tanks Problem, are used to demonstrate the proposed approach and show how the series solution converges to the exact solution in closed form or in series. The corresponding graphs at different levels of uncertainty show the example’s numerical outcomes. The graphical representations further demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in comparison to Taylor’s approaches and the classical Decomposition method.

N2 - Anxiety remains understudied in family carers of people with dementia. Understanding factors that moderate the relationship between stressors and anxiety symptoms in this population is critical to inform interventions. This study examined whether generic experiential avoidance (AAQ-II) and experiential avoidance specific to caregiving-related thoughts and feelings (EACQ) moderate the relationship between subjective burden (ZBI-12) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) in carers of people with dementia. The first model (R2 = .66, ∆R2 = .03) exploring the moderating effect of AAQ-II demonstrated a significant interaction term between AAQ-II and subjective burden. The second model (R2 = .53, ∆R2 = .03), exploring the moderating effect of EACQ, demonstrated a significant interaction term between EACQ and subjective burden. These results provide evidence that carers with higher levels of experiential avoidance may be particularly prone to the negative effect of subjective burden on anxiety symptoms. Clinical implications for assessment of experiential avoidance and its treatment in carers of people with dementia are discussed.
