N2 - To improve the evaluation efficiency of failure probability in RBDO models with uncertainty, many RIA-based, PMA-based methods have evolved as a powerful procedure, including the modified reliability index approach (MRIA), PMA two-level, PMA with sequential approximate programming (SAP). However, MRIA may encounter inefficiency and instability when applied to complex concave performance functions, and so does PMA two-level, not for PMA with SAP. The active set strategy-based SAP (ASS-based SAP) for PMA is proposed to accelerate computational efficiency through establishing an active set strategy and a deciding factor. The active set strategy defined by using inequality is to identify the feasible most probable target point (MPTP) in the inner loop. The decision factor integrates the reliability index and the active set strategy to quickly renew the active constraints in the outer loop. The reliability assessment and outer optimization are driven simultaneously, thereby the computational efficiency is strengthened. Numerical examples are compared with other reliability methods to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in efficiency and robustness. Results also show that the proposed method has the ability to solve complex RBDO problems.

N2 - Background Childhood stunting has a long-term impact on cognitive development and overall well-being. Understanding varying stunting profiles is crucial for targeted interventions and effective policy-making. Therefore, our study aimed to identify the determinants and stunting risk profiles among 2-year-old children in Ethiopia. Methods and materials A cross-sectional study was conducted on 395 mother–child pairs attending selected public health centers for growth monitoring and promotion under 5 outpatient departments and immunization services. The data were collected by face-to-face interviews, with the anthropometric data collected using the procedure stipulated by the World Health Organization. The data were entered using Epi Data version 4.6 and exported to STATA 16 and Jamovi version 2.3.28 for analysis. Bayesian logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify potential factors of stunting. Likewise, lifecycle assessment analysis (LCA) was used to examine the heterogeneity of the magnitude of stunting. Results The overall prevalence of stunting in children under 24 months was 47.34% (95% confidence interval (CI): 42.44-52.29%). The LCA identified 3 distinct risk profiles. The first profile is Class 1, which is labeled as low-risk, comprised 23.8% of the children, and had the lowest prevalence of stunting (23.4%). This group characterized as having a lower risk to stunting. The second profile is Class 2, which is identified as high-risk, comprised 47.1%, and had a high prevalence of stunting (66.7%), indicating a higher susceptibility to stunting compared to Class 1. The third profile is Class 3, which is categorized as mixed-risk and had a moderate stunting prevalence of 35.7%, indicating a complex interplay of factors contributing to stunting. Conclusion Our study identified 3 distinct risk profiles for stunting in young children. A substantial amount (almost half) is in the high-risk category, where stunting is far more common. The identification of stunting profiles necessitates considering heterogeneity in risk factors in interventions. Healthcare practitioners should screen, provide nutrition counseling, and promote breastfeeding. Policymakers should strengthen social safety nets and support primary education.

N2 - Background: Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer’s disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis. Objective: Firstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them. Methods: Systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019. Results: From 3,654 search results, 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and strengths/limitations). Conclusion: Promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support translation of future research into clinical practice.

N2 - The economic logic of the attention economy is frequently used to critique and respond to the dangers of unfettered technological expansion, including nascent platforms and products powered by generative artificial intelligence. This commentary warns that while large parts of the internet have been financed through such business models, there is no guarantee that emerging generative artificial intelligence products will be commercialized in this way too. Instead, I argue, we must look beyond the attention economy to predict the future of monetization of an industry already mired in anti-competitive practices. Using popular large language models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a case, I discuss how some platforms are developing computational dependencies between technology and their users. I propose the term ‘cognitive lock-in’ to help us unpack the implications of such technological dependencies, and redirect the study of this nascent business model.

N2 - The skin is the first line of defense to cutaneous microbes and viruses, and epidermal keratinocytes play a critical role in preventing infection by viruses and pathogens through activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response. Using RNAseq analysis, here we report that the conditional deletion of C/EBPβ transcription factor in mouse epidermis (CKOβ mice) resulted in the upregulation of IFNβ and numerous keratinocyte interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The expression of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (cPRRs), that recognize viral RNA and DNA, were significantly increased, and enriched in the RNAseq data set. cPRRs stimulate a type I IFN response that can trigger cell death to eliminate infected cells. To determine if the observed increases in cPRRs had functional consequences, we transfected CKOβ primary keratinocytes with the pathogen and viral mimics poly(I:C) (dsRNA) or poly(dA:dT) (synthetic B-DNA) that directly activate PRRs. Transfected CKOβ primary keratinocytes displayed an amplified type I IFN response which was accompanied by increased activation of IRF3, enhanced ISG expression, enhanced activation of caspase-8, caspase-3 and increased apoptosis. Our results identify C/EBPβ as a critical repressor of the keratinocyte type I IFN response, and demonstrates that the loss of C/EBPβ primes keratinocytes to the activation of cytosolic PRRs by pathogen RNA and DNA to induce cell death mediated by caspase-8 and caspase-3.

N2 - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Whole genome sequencing has identified recurrent non-coding mutations that may be important in carcinogenesis. We investigate the frequency of 5 such non-coding mutation hotspots in urothelial bladder cancers (UBCs) and assess their potential for UBC detection and prognostication. METHODS: DNA extracted from 302 UBCs was subjected to targeted next generation sequencing of non-coding mutation hotspots in GPR126, PLEKHS1, TBC1D12, LEPROTL1 and WDR74. The frequency of mutations, and associations with stage, grade, age, gender, smoking status, clinical outcomes, mutation signatures and gene expression were analysed using χ2 tests, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Non-coding mutations were common across all stages and grades of UBC. The frequencies were: GPR126 53.0%, PLEKHS1 38.7%, TBC1D12 25.5%, LEPROTL1 23.8% and WDR74 17.2%. There was an average of 1.6 mutations per UBC, and 74% of UBCs harboured at least one mutation. They frequently co-occur, and commonly accompany an APOBEC mutational signature. The mutations are not strongly associated with clinical parameters and are, most likely, early events in the development of UBC. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations at these 5 non-coding hotspots are common in UBC. Due to their high frequency across stages and grades of disease, they should be included in UBC diagnostic biomarker panels.

N2 - The pressure loads acting on the teeth of a labyrinth seal are usually not uniform. Sometimes, one tooth would take almost half of the total pressure difference, which is detrimental to the teeth’s working life and sealing effect. Therefore, the estimation of maximum pressure load on the teeth is helpful to design a sound structure of labyrinth seal. This article analyzes the influence of teeth number, boundary condition, clearances, and structure parameters on maximum pressure loads of labyrinth seal teeth in low pressure ratio conditions (PR≤ 0.5, PR = Pout/Pin). Both the computational fluid dynamics model and test results show that teeth number and pressure load are main factors influencing the maximum pressure load on teeth. Finally, a fitting equation is given to estimate the maximum pressure load on labyrinth seal teeth and its results are in good agreement with the computational fluid dynamics model.

N2 - Background: Data on the performance of newer biologics in patients with fistulizing Crohn’s disease (CD) are limited. Objective: Our study’s objective was to evaluate the response to ustekinumab (UST) and vedolizumab (VDZ) in patients with fistulizing CD. Design: Retrospective cohort. Methods: We used natural language processing of electronic medical record data to identify a retrospective cohort of individuals with fistulizing CD at a single academic tertiary-care referral center and then performed a chart review. Individuals were eligible for inclusion if a fistula was present at the time of UST or VDZ initiation. Outcomes included medication discontinuation, surgical intervention, development of a new fistula, and fistula closure. Groups were compared with unadjusted analyses and competing risk analyses using multi-state survival models. Results: In all, 68 patients were included (48 UST and 20 VDZ). Most patients had one fistula (79%) and had prior anti-tumor necrosis factor-α treatment (98% in UST group, 80% in VDZ group, p = 0.01). VDZ was significantly more likely to be discontinued than UST (p < 0.0001), most frequently due to inadequate clinical response. Those on UST had a longer median time to surgery for CD than those on VDZ (p = 0.008). In those without surgical fistula repair, 79% on UST and 100% on VDZ still had an active fistula at 1 year (p = 0.30). Conclusion: In individuals with fistulizing CD, our data suggest that UST has better clinical utility than VDZ based on lower rates of discontinuation, though the sample size is small. These findings highlight the importance of further research on the treatment of perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease.

N2 - This article addresses a long-term thermal dynamic analysis problem for aircraft fuel tank and the related solution. The new method combines the thermal node network analysis and the finite element numerical calculation based on the OpenFOAM software. Compared to the thermal node network analysis algorithm, the computational precision is significantly improved by numerical calculation on more delicate grid in the solid region. On the other hand, compared to conventional finite element numerical calculation method, the computational efficiency is significantly improved since the liquid level at every moment is determined by the volume integral of every grid along the gravity direction instead of volume of fluid method on the Fluent software and two thermal nodes are used to represent the air and the fuel, respectively, and solve the two-phase heat transfer with the fuel tank by the aid of grid computation of the heat exchange area. Taken a typical fuel tank heated by aerodynamic heat as an example, the results comparing to the volume of fluid calculation by Fluent software show that the computation time is reduced to 10.3%, while the max deviation of the tank wall temperature is kept within 6.5%, which meets the requirements of engineering calculation precision.

N2 - The large amount of fine and light particles in the mine water are difficult to be removed using the traditional separator. In order to improve the separation efficiency, this article presents a new type of compact cone-plate clarifier with which a hybrid process combining magnetic flocculation separation with hydrocycloning can be achieved for sewage treatment. Addition of cone-plates to the elongated vortex finder provides more possibility for small magnetic flocs to aggregate and form into large flocs as well as increase the sedimentation area. The numerical simulation indicates that the cone-plate is conducive to the agglomeration of small particles in the cylindrical body and favorable for flocs to precipitate steadily in the conical part of the clarifier. Further comparative experiment verifies the effectiveness of the cone-plates. Then, the influence of cylinder height, insertion depth, and spacing of cone-plates on the water quality of the clarifier have been researched, and the optimum structural parameters have been determined. With the optimum parameters—a cylinder height of 600 mm, a cone-plate insertion depth of 400 mm, and plate spacing of 20 mm, a property index of 93.71% for suspended solids removal and 70.17% for turbidity decrease has been obtained for the mine water treatment.
