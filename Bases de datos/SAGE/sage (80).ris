N2 - Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most common infections that affect the poorest and most deprived communities. In most developing countries, children aged 5 to 15 years are at risk for chronic helminth infection and associated morbidity. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of STH infections and associated risk factors among three government elementary schools in Dembecha town, Ethiopia. We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study involving 316 participants between November 2019 and March 2020. A systematic random sampling method was used to select study participants from the study schools. Data related to the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants and risk factors for STH infections were collected using a pretested questionnaire survey. Parasitological examinations of stool samples were performed using the formal-ether concentration method. Study participants aged 5 to 15 years were enrolled in this study. The overall prevalence of STH infection was 21.5% (68/316). Ascaris lumbricoides ranked highest, with a prevalence of 11.4%, followed by hookworms 7.3%, Trichuris trichiura 1.9%, and Strongloides stercoralis 0.9%. Age groups of 10-15 years (AOR =3.109; 95% CI: 1.033, 9.350), residence in Kebele 2 (AOR =2.990; 95% CI: 1.082, 8.264), illiterate mothers (AOR =4.689; 95% CI: 1.410, 15.59), and a family size of 4-6 (AOR =3.286; 95% CI: 1.299, 8.313) were significantly associated with STH infections. The prevalence of STH infections remains an important health issue for study participants. Therefore, school deworming programs twice a year are crucially needed until the prevalence falls below the level of public health importance.

N2 - For network users roaming in a wireless sensor network (WSN), they can broadcast queries to WSNs to obtain the latest sensed data from sensor nodes using their mobile devices. In such a scenario, each sensor node has to verify the validity of every query sent from users. In this paper, RSA-like public key cryptography is employed to design a mechanism for multiuser broadcast authentication in WSNs. Within the proposed scheme, the use of certificates becomes optional. When users broadcast queries to WSNs, each sensor node can verify every query immediately without buffering any one. As a result, the energy cost for verifying a query by a sensor node is very small. Furthermore, our scheme provides enough scalability and security. The quantitative analyses show that our scheme is efficient in terms of storage and computational overheads.

N2 - Komatsu Ltd. is reinforcing the research and development of automation technology for our bulldozers. Based on this trend, a methodology for optimized distribution of materials is proposed and developed for dumping area operations using bulldozers in this article. The aim of this work is to develop a robust methodology to contribute to the development of an autonomous system as possible so that it can be applied to our commercial machines immediately. The identified problem is that no formulation has yet been produced which can be applied to achieve such objectives. To develop the methodology, firstly, problem formulation of a specific scenario at the dumping area is presented. Secondly, integer linear programming is applied to solve the distribution problem. A hybrid method combining heuristics techniques and local branching is utilized to make this methodology capable of providing fast and reasonable solutions. Lastly, simulation results with specific different distribution requirements are presented to show that the developed methodology can derive optimized solutions for different requirements with a stable computational performance.

N2 - Images have become a key vehicle for communicating climate change, especially in a visually oriented social media ecosystem. However, few studies have examined the ways in which climate change is visually communicated on those platforms. This study addresses that gap by examining more than 2 million images appearing alongside tweets containing #climatechange, identifying the types of images different stakeholders share and the amount of engagement those images elicit. It highlights differences in the image types that are published frequently (e.g., textual visualizations), the image types that users prefer to engage with (e.g., protest images), and the impact of bots and a cyclical communication pattern keyed to focusing events. These findings are then evaluated through a conceptual framework of media logics, which helps highlight some of the distinctions between (news) media logic and social media logic—and their emerging hybridization—within the context of climate change communication.

N2 - The introduction of computationally efficient binary feature descriptors has raised new opportunities for real-world robot vision applications. However, brute force feature matching of binary descriptors is only practical for smaller datasets. In the literature, there has therefore been an increasing interest in representing and matching binary descriptors more efficiently. In this article, we follow this trend and present a method for efficiently and dynamically quantizing binary descriptors through a summarized frequency count into compact representations (called fsum) for improved feature matching of binary point-features. With the motivation that real-world robot applications must adapt to a changing environment, we further present an overview of the field of algorithms, which concerns the efficient matching of binary descriptors and which are able to incorporate changes over time, such as clustered search trees and bag-of-features improved by vocabulary adaptation. The focus for this article is on evaluation, particularly large scale evaluation, compared to alternatives that exist within the field. Throughout this evaluation it is shown that the fsum approach is both efficient in terms of computational cost and memory requirements, while retaining adequate retrieval accuracy. It is further shown that the presented algorithm is equally suited to binary descriptors of arbitrary type and that the algorithm is therefore a valid option for several types of vision applications.

N2 - The transfer matrix method for multibody systems has been developed for 20 years and improved constantly. The new version of transfer matrix method for multibody system and the automatic deduction method of overall transfer equation presented in recent years make it more convenient of the method for engineering application. In this article, by first defining branch subsystem, any complex multibody system may be regarded as the assembling of branch subsystems and simple chain subsystems. If there are closed loops in the system, the loops should be “cut off,” thus a pair of “new boundaries” are generated at each “cutting-off” point. The relationship between the state vectors of the pair of “new boundaries” may be described by a supplement equation. Based on above work, the automatic deduction method of overall transfer equation for tree systems as well as closed-loop-and-branch-mixed systems is formed. The results of numerical examples obtained by the automatic deduction method and ADAMS software for tree system dynamics as well as mixed system dynamics have good agreements, which validate the features of proposed method such as high computational speed, more effective for complex systems, no need of the system global dynamics equation, highly programmable, as well as convenient popularization and application in engineering.

N2 - Algorithm audits have increased in recent years due to a growing need to independently assess the performance of automatically curated services that process, filter and rank the large and dynamic amount of information available on the Internet. Among several methodologies to perform such audits, virtual agents stand out because they offer the ability to perform systematic experiments, simulating human behaviour without the associated costs of recruiting participants. Motivated by the importance of research transparency and replicability of results, this article focuses on the challenges of such an approach. It provides methodological details, recommendations, lessons learned and limitations based on our experience of setting up experiments for eight search engines (including main, news, image and video sections) with hundreds of virtual agents placed in different regions. We demonstrate the successful performance of our research infrastructure across multiple data collections, with diverse experimental designs, and point to different changes and strategies that improve the quality of the method. We conclude that virtual agents are a promising venue for monitoring the performance of algorithms across long periods of time, and we hope that this article can serve as a basis for further research in this area.

N2 - Purpose Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) represents the most common disorder of the hip in adolescents and a preliminary stage of degenerative joint disease. Up to now, functional outcome evaluation measured by objective instruments has been commonly neglected. The present study investigates whether the pathoanatomy of the hip joint after SCFE—analyzed on a standard X-ray—match functional results gained by three-dimensional gait analysis. A variation of functional outcome depending on the radiological findings after growth arrest is hypothesized. Methods Thirty-seven SCFE patients after growth arrest [mean age 18.5 years, standard deviation (SD) 4.61] with unilateral affection were included. The pathoanatomy of the hip joint was classified according to the radiological index of Heyman and Herndon and to aspherity. Three-dimensional gait analysis parameters were evaluated and subgroup analysis was performed according to the radiological results. Results The radiological findings revealed very good results in general (average comprehensive index of Heyman and Herndon 94 ± 9 %, aspherity grade <2). Significant deviations of gait parameters in relation to the radiological result were an increase in step width, sagittal range of motion (ROM) of the pelvis and foot progression for the worse subgroup. Conclusions Taken as a whole, the pathoanatomy of the hip joint after SCFE matched the functional results gained by gait analysis. Functional outcome varied slightly depending on the radiological findings after growth arrest. Differences were most pronounced for foot progression. Only with the help of gait analysis was it possible to describe deviations more precisely and objectively. Further studies are required in order to show which alterations are relevant for the development of secondary osteoarthritis.

N2 - A mathematical model is established for the preheating commissioning process of waxy crude oil pipelines. The governing equations are solved by the finite volume method and the finite difference method. Accordingly, numerical computations are made for the Niger crude oil pipeline and the Daqing-Tieling 3rd pipeline. The computational results agree well with the field test data. On this basis, fluid temperature in the process of the preheating commissioning is studied for single station-to-station pipeline. By comparing different preheating modes, it is found that the effect of forward preheating is the best. Under different preheating commissioning conditions, the optimal combination of outlet temperature and flow rate is given.
