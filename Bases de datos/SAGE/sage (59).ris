N2 - For science, theoretical or applied, to significantly advance, researchers must use the most appropriate mathematical methods. A century and a half elapsed between Newton’s development of the calculus and Laplace’s development of celestial mechanics. One cannot imagine the latter without the former. Today, more than three-quarters of a century has elapsed since the birth of stochastic systems theory. This article provides a perspective on the utilization of systems theory as the proper vehicle for the development of systems biology and its application to complex regulatory diseases such as cancer.

N2 - This study acquires the attitude dynamics of floating bodies with irregular configurations using an effective computational model, which has been validated theoretically and verified by experiments. By comparison a correlation formula was described to predict inclinations for the floating slender body imitating an excise torpedo. Thereafter a computational model was developed to account for bodies with attitudes in more general situations. For demonstration, a submersible was simulated to reveal that the inclinations vary abruptly around certain longitudinal locations of center of gravity. The property variations during water ingress assumption were presented. Similar to the virtue tank, an innovative concept of building the numerical data base for a specific floating body has been proposed, by which the position of its center of gravity can be obtained by interpolation from attitude data in tables as determined by the present computational model.

N2 - We describe the implementation of a topological constraint in finite-element simulations of phase-field models, which ensures path-connectedness of preimages of intervals in the phase-field variable. The constraint takes the form of an energetic penalty for a suitable geodesic distance between all pairs of points in the domain. The main application of our method presented here is a discrete steepest descent of a phase-field version of a bending energy with spontaneous curvature and additional surface area penalty. This leads to disconnected surfaces without our topological constraint but connected surfaces with the constraint. Numerically, our constraint is treated by first transforming the double integral over all pairs of points in the domain to a weighted graph structure and then using Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the distance between discrete connected components.

N2 - Scholarly literature has demonstrated that hybridity transforms both legacy and new media, but that this change is not even. We treat social media platforms as arenas of remediation, where users share and add their own context to information produced by both media subtypes and compare social media conversations about migration in six European languages that include links to either traditional or new media during 2015–2019. We use a mix of computational and statistical methods to analyze 3.5 million (re)tweets and 500,000 links shared within them. We identify the main differences in agenda setting power, function, and tone present within tweets that include links to legacy or new media. Our results show that discourses are similar across languages but clearly different when remediating legacy and new media. Trust in legacy media is correlated with higher proportion of shared links from legacy media and reversely related to the proportion of shared links from new media sources. Considering the volume and timing of the remediated content, we conclude that legacy media retains its agenda setting power. New media linked content tends to cover migration in association to subjects such as Islam or terrorism and to express strong critical opinions against migrants/refugees. The language used is more toxic than in legacy media linked content. The tweets remediating legacy media articles covered topics like domestic or European politics, causes of refugee arrivals and procedures to give them protection. Thus, legacy and new media remediated content differs in both tone and function: toxicity is low and factuality high for content linking to legacy media, with the reverse being true for new media remediations.

N2 - Enactive approaches to cognitive science aim to explain human cognitive processes across the board without making any appeal to internal, content-carrying representational states. A challenge to such a research programme in cognitive science that immediately arises is how to explain cognition in so-called ‘representation-hungry’ domains. Examples of representation-hungry domains include imagination, memory, planning and language use in which the agent is engaged in thinking about something that may be absent, possible or abstract. The challenge is to explain how someone could think about things that are not concretely present in their environment other than by means of an internal mental representation. We call this the ‘Representation-Hungry Challenge’ (RHC). The challenge we take up in this article is to show how hunger for representations could possibly be satisfied by means other than the construction and manipulation of internal representational states. We meet this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that integrates key ideas drawn from enactive cognitive science and ecological psychology. One of our main aims is thus to show how ecological and enactive theories as non-representational and non-computational approaches to cognitive science might work together. From enactive cognitive science, we borrow the thesis of the strict continuity of lower and higher cognition. We develop this thesis to argue against any sharp conceptual distinction between higher and lower cognition based on representation-hunger. From ecological psychology, we draw upon our earlier work on the rich landscape of affordances. We propose thinking of so-called representation-hungry cognition in terms of temporally extended activities in which the agent skilfully coordinates to a richly structured landscape of affordances. In our framework, putative cases of representation-hungry cognition are explained by abilities to coordinate nested activities to an environment structured by interrelated socio-material practices. The RHC has often figured in arguments for the limitations of non-representational approaches to cognitive science. We showcase the theoretical resources available to an integrated ecological-enactive approach for addressing this type of sceptical challenge.

N2 - For the reason of enormous computational expense, although the least squares finite element method has the advantages of high accuracy, robustness and strong versatility, the application of it is limited in computational fluid dynamics. The problems solved in this article include the rewriting of branching statements and the kernel function, variable distribution and data transfer between graphic processing units, and library functions rewriting. To the best knowledge of the authors, this article is the first time to develop the parallel computing codes for single and multiple graphic processing units based on the least squares finite element method. The computational results of single and multiple graphic processing units are verified by lid-driven cavity flow. Compared with a single central processing unit on the condition of 1203 grids, the acceleration ratios of single and dual graphic processing units are up to 70.5 times and 95.2 times, respectively, which is much higher than the previous value of 7.7. With the increase in the grid number, the acceleration ratio of single and multiple graphic processing units is expected to increase, which can greatly enhance the computational efficiency of the least squares finite element method. Therefore, it is possible to solve the massive turbulence computing by the least squares finite element method with higher efficiency.

N2 - The study examines chemiluminescence measurements and computations as a method of validation. Because chemiluminescent radicals are present in small concentrations and associated timescales are also small, a common assumption is that these are quasi-steady-state species and their transport can be ignored. This paper examines the above assumption using available data and simulation results, specifically aiming at a single element rocket combustor under strong pressure fluctuations. Variations in the kinetics rate constants are considered for assessing sensitivity of the results. Two additional aspects are explored: the ability of the excited species to represent the chemical heat release and the optical thickness of the medium. For the conditions of the study, the quasi-steady-state assumption in the case of OH* is found to be marginally insufficient while in the case of CH*, it is found to be acceptable. Modeled heat release is qualitatively better captured by CH* than OH* because of higher difference in the peak to asymptotic concentrations and lower ground state concentration.

N2 - We revisit the notion of initial sets by Xu and Cayrol (In Proceedings of the 1st Chinese Conference on Logic and Argumentation (CLAR’16) 2016), i. e., non-empty minimal admissible sets in abstract argumentation frameworks. Initial sets are a simple concept for analysing conflicts in an abstract argumentation framework and to explain why certain arguments can be accepted. We contribute with new insights on the structure of initial sets and devise a simple non-deterministic construction principle for any admissible set, based on iterative selection of initial sets of the original framework and its induced reducts. In particular, we characterise many existing admissibility-based semantics via this construction principle, thus providing a constructive explanation on the structure of extensions. We also investigate certain problems related to initial sets with respect to their computational complexity.

N2 - Argumentation is a mechanism to support different forms of reasoning such as decision making and persuasion and always cast under the light of critical thinking. In the latest years, several computational approaches to argumentation have been proposed to detect conflicting information, take the best decision with respect to the available knowledge, and update our own beliefs when new information arrives. The common point of all these approaches is that they assume a purely rational behavior of the involved actors, be them humans or artificial agents. However, this is not the case as humans are proved to behave differently, mixing rational and emotional attitudes to guide their actions. Some works have claimed that there exists a strong connection between the argumentation process and the emotions felt by people involved in such process. We advocate a complementary, descriptive and experimental method, based on the collection of emotional data about the way human reasoners handle emotions during debate interactions. Across different debates, people’s argumentation in plain English is correlated with the emotions automatically detected from the participants, their engagement in the debate, and the mental workload required to debate. Results show several correlations among emotions, engagement and mental workload with respect to the argumentation elements. For instance, when two opposite opinions are conflicting, this is reflected in a negative way on the debaters’ emotions. Beside their theoretical value for validating and inspiring computational argumentation theory, these results have applied value for developing artificial agents meant to argue with human users or to assist users in the management of debates.

N2 - In heterogeneous scenarios, nodes greatly differ with respect to their capabilities and mobility patterns. Moreover, episodic connectivity in opportunistic networks further aggravates the problem of finding a suitable next-hop to obviate unnecessary utilization of network resources. In this paper, we present a Multiattribute Routing Scheme (MARS) based on “Simple Multiattribute Rating Technique” (SMART) that collects samples of vital information about a node’s different characteristics. This stochastic picture of a node behavior in multiple dimensions is then effectively employed in calculating its next-hop fitness. We also devise a method based on learning rules of neural networks which dynamically determines relative importance of each dimension to maximize next-hop utility of a node. With simulations, using synthetic and real mobility traces against well-known utility-based schemes, we show that MARS can achieve better delivery ratios despite introducing limited redundancy within the network.
