N2 - Categorization of rhythmic patterns is prevalent in musical practice, an example of this being the transcription of (possibly not strictly metrical) music into musical notation. In this article we implement a dynamical systems’ model of rhythm categorization based on the resonance theory of rhythm perception developed by Large (2010). This model is used to simulate the categorical choices of participants in two experiments of Desain and Honing (2003). The model accurately replicates the experimental data. Our results support resonance theory as a viable model of rhythm perception and show that by viewing rhythm perception as a dynamical system it is possible to model central properties of rhythm categorization.

N2 - This article addresses a fundamental path planning problem which aims to route a collection of heterogeneous vehicles such that each target location is visited by some vehicle and the sum of the travel costs of the vehicles is minimal. Vehicles are heterogeneous as the cost of traveling between any two locations depends on the type of the vehicle. Algorithms are developed for this path planning problem with bounds on the quality of the solutions produced by the algorithms. Computational results show that high quality solutions can be obtained for the path planning problem involving four vehicles and 40 targets using the proposed approach.

N2 - This paper presents the results of a pilot interview study investigating the leisure reading habits of 20 practising AI researchers based in the United Kingdom. The interview analysis yields six areas in which literature plays a role in the field of AI: research focus, career choice, community formation, science communication, ethical thinking, and modelling of sociotechnical futures. These categories are proposed as the basis of a systematic taxonomy of the role of literature in AI research, evidencing literature’s significance in AI laboratory and professional cultures. The paper presents the results of this preliminary investigation in combination with a synthesis of existing evidence in each category of influence. The aim of this hybrid approach is to cohere research and evidence in this relatively new area of study, and to present new findings contextually, in order to provide the foundations for further qualitative and quantitative research.

N2 - Phylogenetic methods have revolutionised evolutionary biology and have recently been applied to studies of linguistic and cultural evolution. However, the basic comparative data on the languages of the world required for these analyses is often widely dispersed in hard to obtain sources. Here we outline how our Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (ABVD) helps remedy this situation by collating wordlists from over 500 languages into one web-accessible database. We describe the technology underlying the ABVD and discuss the benefits that an evolutionary bioinformatic approach can provide. These include facilitating computational comparative linguistic research, answering questions about human prehistory, enabling syntheses with genetic data, and safe-guarding fragile linguistic information.

N2 - The current study is based on an examination of the effect of Newtonian blood flow on the value of the wall shearing stress of an intracranial aneurysm using computational fluid dynamics. Blood is frequently thought to behave like a Newtonian fluid in cerebral arteries. It is fully described how a saccular aneurysm affects a model of blood-silver (Ag) nanofluid flow via an artery. Blood is regarded as a based fluid because of its rheology. The blood flow is Newtonian, laminar, incompressible, viscous, and unsteady, blood enters with a velocity of 0.08 ms−1 and the arterial wall should be flexible. The novelty of the research is to examine the impact of nanoparticles (Ag) on saccular aneurysm. To find the solution, a time-dependent direct solver was employed. To get the answer, the finite element discretization method (FDM) is applied. Coupled partial differential equations are used to mathematically describe the rheology of blood. In the current analysis, the solutions for velocity, temperature, and pressure distribution are found. Figures are used to illustrate and quickly discuss the effects of physical parameters on the characteristics of arterial blood flow for silver nanoparticles. These findings will be extremely beneficial in the treatment of arteries with aneurysms.

N2 - X-ray imaging applications in medical and material sciences are frequently limited by the number of tomographic projections collected. The inversion of the limited projection data is an ill-posed problem and needs regularization. Traditional spatial regularization is not well adapted to the dynamic nature of time-lapse tomography since it discards the redundancy of the temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm with a nonlocal regularization term to account for time-evolving datasets. The aim of the proposed nonlocal penalty is to collect the maximum relevant information in the spatial and temporal domains. With the proposed sparsity seeking approach in the temporal space, the computational complexity of the classical nonlocal regularizer is substantially reduced (at least by one order of magnitude). The presented reconstruction method can be directly applied to various big data 4D (x, y, z+time) tomographic experiments in many fields. We apply the proposed technique to modelled data and to real dynamic X-ray microtomography (XMT) data of high resolution. Compared to the classical spatio-temporal nonlocal regularization approach, the proposed method delivers reconstructed images of improved resolution and higher contrast while remaining significantly less computationally demanding.

N2 - This article proposes and completely describes a modification of the Hybrid A* method used for navigation of a non-holonomic mobile wheeled robot. Our modification allows straightforward multi-criterial adjustment of the algorithm according to the desired behavior considering not only traveled distance but also time, changing of direction, stopping, going backwards while avoiding obstacles. The obstacle avoidance algorithm evaluates the danger of collision smoothly (not-binarily) using danger fields. Such behavior reflects human-like sensing of danger—the closer to the obstacle the robot is, the higher is the danger of collision. A modified uniform state expansion method has been used to cover the state space of the robot more uniformly providing the possibility of precise near-target navigation. A greed factor has been introduced to decrease the computational time and improve the real-time performance of the algorithm.

N2 - With larger data sets and more sophisticated analyses, it is becoming increasingly common for neuroimaging researchers to push (or exceed) the limitations of standalone computer workstations. Nonetheless, although high-performance computing platforms such as clusters, grids and clouds are already in routine use by a small handful of neuroimaging researchers to increase their storage and/or computational power, the adoption of such resources by the broader neuroimaging community remains relatively uncommon. Therefore, the goal of the current manuscript is to: 1) inform prospective users about the similarities and differences between computing clusters, grids and clouds; 2) highlight their main advantages; 3) discuss when it may (and may not) be advisable to use them; 4) review some of their potential problems and barriers to access; and finally 5) give a few practical suggestions for how interested new users can start analyzing their neuroimaging data using cloud resources. Although the aim of cloud computing is to hide most of the complexity of the infrastructure management from end-users, we recognize that this can still be an intimidating area for cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists, neurologists, radiologists, and other neuroimaging researchers lacking a strong computational background. Therefore, with this in mind, we have aimed to provide a basic introduction to cloud computing in general (including some of the basic terminology, computer architectures, infrastructure and service models, etc.), a practical overview of the benefits and drawbacks, and a specific focus on how cloud resources can be used for various neuroimaging applications.

N2 - Objective Vaccination misinformation is widespread on social media. Vaccine-promoting organisations are working to curb its influence, but face obstacles. We aimed to analyse their social media strategies and the challenges they encounter. Methods In this qualitative study, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for social media from vaccine-promoting organisations. We used Framework Analysis to explore the data. Results Vaccine-promoting organisations faced obstacles using social media, including fast-paced change, limited resources, and insufficient organisational buy-in. They experienced difficulties reaching audiences, exploiting social media listening, and measuring impact. Consequently, they may miss opportunities to counter misinformation, connect with groups low in vaccine confidence, and determine diverse audience responses. They lack strong evidence linking social media strategies with behaviour change, and have difficulty understanding silent audiences. Conclusions Vaccine-promoting organisations have an opportunity to embrace the participatory nature of social media. They could share listening insights with like-minded groups, and conduct research exploring associations between social media strategies and community attitude/behaviour change. Social media platforms could assist by renewing vaccine-promoting organisations’ organic reach, supporting the development of tailored listening and credibility tools, and strengthening collaborations to promote credible content.

N2 - Proline is an important amino acid that plays unique roles in the structures of peptides and proteins. The conformations of proline are searched by a thorough method, generating 3888 trial structures optimized at the B97D/6-311++G** level. A total of 23 conformations are found and their structural and energetic data are presented. All the proline conformers exhibit a coplanar feature for four of the five pyrrolidine ring atoms. The coplanar rule reduces the cost of the conformational search by a factor of 40. The theoretical composition-weighted infrared spectrum provides a good explanation of the experimental results. A conformational search of capped proline yields seven unique conformers, all with trans C-termini peptide planes. The trans C-termini rule further cuts by half the cost of the conformational search of proline-containing peptides. The theoretical composition of the cis N-termini peptide bonds at room temperature is 5.5%, agreeing with the experimental estimations of 3%–10%.
