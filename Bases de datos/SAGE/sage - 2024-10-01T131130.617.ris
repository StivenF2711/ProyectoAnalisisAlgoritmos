N2 - This article mainly focuses on the influence of heat and mass transportation of micropolar second grade nanofluid toward porous medium of an exponentially stretched surface. The significance of activation energy and viscous dissipation with magnetic effect are taken into deliberated. Furthermore, to analyze the heat and mass transport scrutiny the concentration and thermal slip boundary conditions are assessed on the surface of the sheet. The convenient similarity variables are adopted to transfer the non-linear governing PDEs into the dimensionless ODEs and their corresponding boundary conditions also transformed. The nonlinear coupled ODEs are numerically solved by the usage of BVP4C MATLAB technique. The obtained numerical estimations are displayed graphically to display the significance of the various parameters against the velocity, temperature, microrotation, concentration distributions. It is noticed that larger estimations of micropolar and second grade parameter improves the fluid velocity consequently, while opposite trend is found for the higher estimation of porous medium parameter. Further, it is observed that the skin friction rate is boosted by the increment of and , whereas opposite trend is noted against the mass transfer rate and heat transfer rate.

N2 - Background: Current treatments for schizophrenia act directly on dopamine (DA) receptors but are ineffective for many patients, highlighting the need to develop new treatment approaches. Striatal DA dysfunction, indexed using [18F]-FDOPA imaging, is linked to the pathoetiology of schizophrenia. We evaluated the effect of a novel drug, AUT00206, a Kv3.1/3.2 potassium channel modulator, on dopaminergic function in schizophrenia and its relationship with symptom change. Additionally, we investigated the test–retest reliability of [18F]-FDOPA PET in schizophrenia to determine its potential as a biomarker for drug discovery. Methods: Twenty patients with schizophrenia received symptom measures and [18F]-FDOPA PET scans, before and after being randomised to AUT00206 or placebo groups for up to 28 days treatment. Results: AUT00206 had no significant effect on DA synthesis capacity. However, there was a correlation between reduction in striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (indexed as Kicer) and reduction in symptoms, in the AUT00206 group (r = 0.58, p = 0.03). This was not observed in the placebo group (r = −0.15, p = 0.75), although the placebo group may have been underpowered to detect an effect. The intraclass correlation coefficients of [18F]-FDOPA indices in the placebo group ranged from 0.83 to 0.93 across striatal regions. Conclusions: The relationship between reduction in DA synthesis capacity and improvement in symptoms in the AUT00206 group provides evidence for a pharmacodynamic effect of the Kv3 channel modulator. The lack of a significant overall reduction in DA synthesis capacity in the AUT00206 group could be due to variability and the low number of subjects in this study. These findings support further investigation of Kv3 channel modulators for schizophrenia treatment. [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging showed very good test–retest reliability in patients with schizophrenia.

N2 - We investigate how news values differ between online and print news articles. We hypothesize that print and online articles differ in terms of news values because of differences in the routines used to produce them. Based on a quantitative automated content analysis of N = 762,095 Dutch news items, we show that online news items are more likely to be follow-up items than print items, and that there are further differences regarding news values like references to persons, the power elite, negativity, and positivity. In order to conduct this large-scale analysis, we developed innovative methods to automatically code a wide range of news values. In particular, this article demonstrates how techniques such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, supervised machine learning, and automated queries of external databases can be combined and used to study journalistic content. Possible explanations for the difference found between online and offline news are discussed.

N2 - Most important large-scale surveys carried out by national statistical institutes are the repeated survey type, typically intended to produce estimates for several parameters of the whole population, as well as parameters related to some subpopulations. Small area estimation techniques are becoming more and more important for the production of official statistics where direct estimators are not able to produce reliable estimates. In order to exploit data from different survey cycles, unit-level linear mixed models with area and time random effects can be considered. However, the large amount of data to be processed may cause computational problems. To overcome the computational issues, a reformulation of predictors and the correspondent mean cross product estimator is given. The R code based on the new formulation enables the elaboration of about 7.2 millions of data records in a matter of minutes.

N2 - Background: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered the gold standard for proper diagnosis of hypertension. Yet, access to ABPM in the U.S. is limited, and the extent of coverage by commercial health plans remains uncertain, potentially limiting access to ABPM among commercially insured patients. Objective: This study aims to assess the net cost impact of using ABPM in comparison to clinical blood pressure monitoring (CBPM) in the U.S. over a 5-year time period. Design methods: Using a Markov Model, we estimate the 5-year cumulative cost impact of using ABPM to confirm a prior diagnosis of primary hypertension using CBPM to avoid treatment for white-coat hypertension (WCH) in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients from a U.S. healthcare system perspective. The probability and cost inputs for the model were derived from available literature. Base-case model parameters were varied to account for different scenarios. Results: Base-case results indicate using ABPM instead of CBPM over 5 years saves a total of $348,028, reflecting an average per-person-per-year (PPPY) cost saving of $70. In sensitivity analyses, almost all cases reveal ABPM as a cost-saving approach compared to CBPM, with cost savings reaching up to $228 PPPY in the highest hypertension treatment cost model. Regression results reveal that ABPM was cost-saving compared to CBPM if ABPM annual payment rates are $100 or less and annual hypertension treatment costs are ⩾$300. Conclusion: The potential cost-savings of using ABPM instead of CBPM found in our simulation model underscores the need for confirmatory research using real-world data to support increased use of ABPM as the standard diagnostic approach for hypertension.

N2 - Developing system understanding and testing interventions are critical steps to addressing wicked problems. Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) can be a useful participatory modeling tool that enables aggregation of individual perspectives to build system models that represent groups’ collective intelligence (CI). However, current FCM aggregation methodologies for creating CI models have rarely been tested and compared. We conducted 51 FCM interviews with local experts in the Flint, MI food system to map their mental models about how different food system sectors influenced desirable outcomes. Using four differing aggregation techniques, based on experts’ identity diversity and cognitive diversity, we generated four CI models. The models were compared based on their similarity to real-world complex systems using performance metrics like network structure, micro-motifs, cognitive distance, and scenario outcomes. We found that using cognitive diversity to group individuals was better suited for modeling systems with diverse holders of knowledge.

N2 - Computational analysis is utilized to examine the effects of introducing nanoparticles to a square lid-driven cavity to enhance the hydro-magnet mixed convection. Constant temperatures are imposed along the square container’s vertical edges. Both the top and bottom surfaces are covered with insulation. The lid is thought to move in two ways: increasing or decreasing free convection. In addition, a horizontal magnetic field is applied uniformly. For various Hartmann numbers (Ha) (0:100), Richardson numbers (Ri) (0.001:10), and solid volume fractions (0:0.1), the results are reported. This research is based on a constant Grashof number (Gr) of 104. The effects of parameters, including the Richardson number, Hartmann number, solid volume percentage on the stream, isothermal lines, and local Nusselt numbers (Nu), were investigated numerically. In addition, given various parametric settings, the anticipated results for the average Nusselt (Nuavg) are shown and discussed. For all tested parameters, increasing the magnetic field makes the orientation of the lid more effective on heat and fluid movement. The magnetic field reduces heat and fluid flow. The heat transmission is aided by increasing the solid volume percentage. The effect of nanoparticles on flow and heat transmission is being studied. At Ri = 0.001, the effect of lid orientation is not significant. The highest reduction in heat transfer occurs when adding flow at Ri = 10,  = 0, and Ha = 100.

N2 - In gas gathering pipeline system, 90° elbow suffers constant and severe collision of gas-carrying particles, which causes serious erosion on the inner wall. In this study, models of standard elbows (carbon steel with 210 GPa in elasticity modulus and 8300 kg/m3 in density) whose diameter varies from 65 to 200 mm with curvature ratio 1.5 are established to predict erosion rate causes by silica sand (100 μm in diameter, 1550 kg/m3 in bulk density) under gas gathering operating conditions (5.0 MPa, 10 m/s). Unlike most of the previous studies which only focus on erosion result on the wall, in this article, author extracts sample particles as research objects and studies the motion of every single particle. It has been found that there are three typical types of particle motion patterns in the elbow, and a part of sand particles released from lower area of incident plane will not even cause erosion.

N2 - Chaperone therapy is a newly developed molecular approach to lysosomal diseases, a group of human genetic diseases causing severe brain damage. We found two valienamine derivatives, N-octyl-4-epi-β-valienamine (NOEV) and N-octyl-β-valienamine (NOV), as promising therapeutic agents for human β-galactosidase deficiency disorders (mainly GM1-gangliosidosis) and β-glucosidase deficiency disorders (Gaucher disease), respectively. We briefly reviewed the historical background of research in carbasugar glycosidase inhibitors. Originally NOEV and NOV had been discovered as competitive inhibitors, and then their paradoxical bioactivities as chaperones were confirmed in cultured fibroblasts from patients with these disorders. Subsequently GM1-gangliosidosis model mice were developed and useful for experimental studies. Orally administered NOEV entered the brain through the blood-brain barrier, enhanced β-galactosidase activity, reduced substrate storage, and improved neurological deterioration clinically. Furthermore, we executed computational analysis for prediction of molecular interactions between β-galactosidase and NOEV. Some preliminary results of computational analysis of molecular interaction mechanism are presented in this article. NOV also showed the chaperone effect toward several β-glucosidase gene mutations in Gaucher disease. We hope chaperone therapy will become available for some patients with GM1-gangliosidosis, Gaucher disease, and potentially other lysosomal storage diseases with central nervous system involvement.

N2 - This study investigates the energy harvesting prospects of self-sustained flow oscillations emanating from grazing flow over a rectangular cavity by employing experimental and computational methods. Two cavity geometries with length-to-depth ratios of 2 and 3, exposed to an incoming flow of 30 m/s, were selected for the purpose. The power spectral density of the baseline cavity flows showed the presence of high-amplitude peaks whose frequencies agreed to those estimated from Rossiter’s feedback model. For energy harvesting, a piezoelectric beam was placed perpendicular to the aft wall and its natural frequency tuned to match closely with the dominant frequencies of the cavity flow oscillations. From the experiments, an average and maximum instantaneous power of 21.11 and 284.18 µW was recorded for the cavity with L/D = 2 whereas for the cavity with L/D = 3 the corresponding values were 32.16 and 403.46 µW respectively. Time-frequency analysis showed the forcing of the beam at the cavity oscillation frequency and the substantial increase in the amplitude of beam vibrations when this frequency was close to the natural frequency of the beam.
