N2 - We combine empirical experimental research on biased argument processing with a computational theory of group deliberation to overcome the micro–macro problem of sociology and to clarify the role of biased processing in debates around energy. We integrate biased processing into the framework of argument communication theory in which agents exchange arguments about a certain topic and adapt opinions accordingly. Our derived mathematical model fits significantly better to the experimentally observed attitude changes than the neutral argument processing assumption made in previous models. Our approach provides new insight into the relationship between biased processing and opinion polarization. Our analysis reveals a sharp qualitative transition from attitude moderation to polarization at the individual level. At the collective level, we find that weak biased processing significantly accelerates group decision processes, whereas strong biased processing leads to a meta-stable conflictual state of bi-polarization that becomes persistent as the bias increases.

N2 - As part of the Lorentz workshop, “Interdisciplinary Insights into Group and Team Dynamics,” held in Leiden, Netherlands, this article describes how Geeks and Groupies (computer and social scientists) may benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration toward the development of killer apps in team contexts that are meaningful and challenging for both. First, we discuss interaction processes during team meetings as a research topic for both Groupies and Geeks. Second, we highlight teamwork in health care settings as an interdisciplinary research challenge. Third, we discuss how an automated solution for optimal team design could benefit team effectiveness and feed into team-based interventions. Fourth, we discuss team collaboration in massive open online courses as a challenge for both Geeks and Groupies. We argue for the necessary integration of social and computational research insights and approaches. In the hope of inspiring future interdisciplinary collaborations, we develop criteria for evaluating killer apps—including the four proposed here—and discuss future research challenges and opportunities that potentially derive from these developments.

N2 - The mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is 17 times higher than nuclear DNA, and these mutations can cause mitochondrial disease in 1 of 10.000 people. The T10609C mutation was identified in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and the C10676G mutation in cataract patients, with both mutations occurring in the ND4L gene of mtDNA that encodes ND4L protein. ND4L protein, a subunit of complex I in the respiratory complex, has been shown to play a role in the proton translocation process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of both mutations on the proton translocation mechanism. Mutation mapping showed changes in amino acids M47T (T10609C) and C69W (C10676G). The 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on native and mutants of ND4L-ND6 subunits. It is revealed that the native model had a similar proton translocation pathway to that of complex I from other organisms. Interestingly, the mutant M47T and C69W showed the interruption of the translocation pathway by a hydrogen bond formation between Glu34 and Tyr157. It is observed that the mutations were restricting the passage of water molecules through the transmembrane region. These results could help to develop the computational assay for the validation of a specific genetic biomarker for T2DM and cataracts.

N2 - According to Brooks [2017. “The Big Problem with Self-driving Cars Is People”. IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News], artificial intelligence has had a variable track-record of usefulness in situations where context and environmental knowledge are responsible for shaping human interactions. In 2021, providing contextually aware training to supervised machine learning is still a non-trivial task for AI models that involve complex systems. In addition, knowledge held only across distributed members of a community, within culture, or tacitly within the wider environment of the ambient commons [McCullough 2013. Ambient Commons: Attention in the Age of Embodied Information. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] evades consistent generalizable modelling – even in technical domains such as traffic flow management, atmospheric chemistry, or the prediction of election results. Yet it is precisely these interactions of context, community, culture and environment that also define how music can be created. The creative arts can themselves be thought of as a complex system. Assuming that creativity is non-generalizable, this paper assesses creative processes through a humanities-centric lens of machine learning and robotics, aiming to better understand relationships between context, environment and experimental system in artistic research. These relationships are now themselves significantly digitally mediated, requiring a change in academic discourse away from artefacts which need discrete research justification towards a more holistic, and often non-linear view of networks that require cultural situation. In doing so, issues of creative accountability [Field 2021. “Changing the Vocabulary of Creative Research: The Role of Networks, Risk, and Accountability in Transcending Technical Rationality.” In Sound Work: Composition as Critical Technical Practice, edited by J. Impett, 303–317.Orpheus Institute Series. Leuven: Leuven University Press] and the implications of substituting “creative question” for “research question” are examined within creative research. Early twentieth century ideas related to progressivism which have instrumentalized creative practice, particularly where technology forms part of art making, are challenged by re-thinking change through new models. The Three Horizons change model [Sharpe 2016. “Three Horizons: A Pathways Practice for Transformation.” Ecology and Society 21 (2): 47] originally intended to describe environmental ecosystems, is assessed as a practical tool for designing creative research.

N2 - In this article, the acoustic characterisation of a turbocharger compressor with ported shroud design is carried out through the numerical simulation of the system operating under design conditions of maximum isentropic efficiency. While ported shroud compressors have been proposed as a way to control the flow near unstable conditions in order to obtain a more stable operation and enhance deep surge margin, it is often assumed that the behaviour under stable design conditions is characterised by a smooth, non-detached flow that matches an equivalent standard compressor. Furthermore, research is scarce regarding the acoustic effects of the ported shroud addition, especially under the design conditions. To analyse the flow field evolution and its relation with the noise generation, spectral signatures using statistical and scale-resolving turbulence modelling methods are obtained after successfully validating the performance and acoustic predictions of the numerical model with experimental measurements. Propagation of the frequency content through the ducts has been estimated with the aid of pressure decomposition methods to enhance the content coming from the compressor. Expected acoustic phenomena such as ‘buzz-saw’ tones, blade passing peaks and broadband noise are correctly identified in the modelled spectrum. Analysis of the flow behaviour in the ported shroud shows rotating structures through the slot that may impact the acoustic and vibration response. Further inspection of the pressure field through modal decomposition confirms the influence of the ported shroud cavity in noise generation and propagation, especially at lower frequencies, suggesting that further research should be carried out on the impact these flow enhancement solutions have on the noise emission of the turbocharger.

N2 - The present investigation is focused on modeling of spray in crossflow using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The modeling efforts are supported by experiments which are used both to provide accurate boundary and initial conditions and to evaluate droplet shapes in the near nozzle region. The droplets are modeled as Lagrangian parcels in an Eulerian continuum. Droplets in such configuration have been found to be distorted and not in perfect spherical shape from experimental results of our previous study. Droplet distortion is computed by Taylor-Analogy Breakup (TAB) distortion model. Each droplet is modelled as damped spring-mass system, where surface tension acts as a spring on the mass of the droplet and viscous dissipation provides the damping effect. The effort is to examine the effect of drag law used and the effect of this distortion on the droplet sizes produced in the flow field. Spray wind-ward trajectory and droplet sizes obtained from simulations are compared with the experimental results available. Although computational spray trajectory shows a reasonable match with experimental values, droplet sizes using the standard TAB model are found to be larger than that from experimental observation. To account for this distortion and its role in early breakup of droplets, constants of the TAB model are modified and the droplet sizes are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

N2 - Computational propaganda and the use of automated accounts in social media have recently become the focus of public attention, with alleged Russian government activities abroad provoking particularly widespread interest. However, even in the Russian domestic context, where anecdotal evidence of state activity online goes back almost a decade, no public systematic attempt has been made to dissect the population of Russian social media bots by their political orientation. We address this gap by developing a deep neural network classifier that separates pro-regime, anti-regime, and neutral Russian Twitter bots. Our method relies on supervised machine learning and a new large set of labeled accounts, rather than externally obtained account affiliations or orientation of elites. We also illustrate the use of our method by applying it to bots operating in Russian political Twitter from 2015 to 2017 and show that both pro- and anti-Kremlin bots had a substantial presence on Twitter.

N2 - New and emerging forms of data, including posts harvested from social media sites such as Twitter, have become part of the sociologist’s data diet. In particular, some researchers see an advantage in the perceived ‘public’ nature of Twitter posts, representing them in publications without seeking informed consent. While such practice may not be at odds with Twitter’s terms of service, we argue there is a need to interpret these through the lens of social science research methods that imply a more reflexive ethical approach than provided in ‘legal’ accounts of the permissible use of these data in research publications. To challenge some existing practice in Twitter-based research, this article brings to the fore: (1) views of Twitter users through analysis of online survey data; (2) the effect of context collapse and online disinhibition on the behaviours of users; and (3) the publication of identifiable sensitive classifications derived from algorithms.

N2 - The three-dimensional frequency-domain linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSEs) with consideration of eddy viscosity are developed to evaluate the acoustic attenuation performance of perforated hybrid mufflers in the presence of non-uniform flow. The computations are performed in two steps: time averaged flow variables are acquired by using steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and then mapped into the acoustic mesh, and the acoustic perturbation variables are obtained by solving frequency-domain LNSEs, where the sound-absorbing material is treated as an equivalent fluid with complex sound speed and density. The predictions of transmission losses of the two-pass perforated hybrid mufflers in the presence of non-uniform flow are in good consistencies with the measurements, which verifies the correctness of LNSEs. The effect of Mach numbers on acoustic attenuation performance of the mufflers with different filling densities and perforated components is investigated in detail. The transmission loss of the mufflers with various filling densities are increased by complex airflow in the lower frequency range. For the mufflers where not all components have been perforated, the flow lowers low-frequency resonance peak. The influence of complex airflow on acoustic attenuation performance of all configurations is weakened at higher frequencies.
