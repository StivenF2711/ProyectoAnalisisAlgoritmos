N2 - Revealing the gene regulatory systems among DNA and proteins in living cells is one of the central aims of systems biology. In this study, I used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in combination with stepwise factor analysis to infer the protein-DNA interactions for gene expression control from only gene expression profiles, in the absence of protein information. I applied my approach to infer the causalities within the well-studied serial transcriptional regulation composed of GAL-related genes in yeast. This allowed me to reveal the hierarchy of serial transcriptional regulation, including previously unclear protein-DNA interactions. The validity of the constructed model was demonstrated by comparing the results with previous reports describing the regulation of the transcription factors. Furthermore, the model revealed combinatory regulation by Ga14p and Ga180p. In this study, the target genes were divided into three types: those regulated by one factor and those controlled by a combination of two factors.

N2 - Freshwater bodies such as lakes, rivers, and their biodiversity are being threatened with water pollution from industrial effluents and household sewages. The main objective of this study is to assess the effects of wet coffee processing plants effluent on the physicochemical and bacteriological properties of receiving rivers. Four rivers and 4 sampling points of the selected rivers were included in the study. Focus group discussion and interview were employed to gather primary data. The result showed that parameters of water quality for downstream of the rivers were significant, particularly in the dry season with BODs ranging from 45 ± 1 to 782.6 ± 97 g/ml, COD ranges from 71 ± 21 to 1072 ± 183 g/ml, Conductivity ranges from 75.5 ± 6.6 to 943 ± 56.3, Turbidity ranges from 7 ± 0.43 to 105 ± 6.2, TDS ranges from 62 ± 6.4 to 1059.6 ± 121 g/ml, temperature ranges from 20.1 to 33 ± 1, T. coli form ranges from 77 ± 1.1 to 493 ± 66 and E. coli ranges from 28 ± 1 to 213 ± 41 were significantly higher and DO ranges from 2.6 ± 0.15 to 6.1 ± 0.78 g/ml, NH4 ranges from 1.85 ± 0.4 to 3.3 ± 0.5 g/ml, and pH ranges from 3.6 ± 0.2 to 7.3 ± 0.45 were significantly lower. Most of the samples taken from wastewater and downstream parts of the river showed high level of water contaminants that are significantly greater than the EEPA discharge limits for surface water. Moreover, the qualitative data indicated that the community was affected by bad smell and color change on rivers, skin irritation, malarial case in human due to coffee processing plant effluents. Therefore, coffee processing plants should treat their effluents before they discharge it into the rivers. Responsible government bodies should authorize activities of coffee processing plants in line with the regulations set for environmental safety.

N2 - Objectives The objective of this study was to analyze the fatty acid content, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of Argemone mexicana seed oil growing wild in north East Ethiopia. Materials and Methods Oils of A mexicana L. were obtained by means of Screw press from seeds. Methyl esters were derived from the oily mixtures by trans-esterification process and were analyzed by GC/FID and GC/MS systems. This oil was investigated for antioxidant activity using a DPPH radical-scavenging assay and was also tested against a panel of microorganisms. Results Linolenic acid (49.00%) and oleic acid (28.91%) were the most abundant fatty acids in leaves and stems, respectively. The oil showed moderate to highest antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Shigella dysentery, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Escherichia coli. The oil also demonstrated the highest antioxidant activity with the percentage of inhibition of 92.5% at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL, and its IC50 and AAI were 22.4 µg/mL and 4.93 µg/mL, respectively. Conclusion The results obtained from the present study indicated that the oil of A mexicana seed oil contained a high source of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results also showed that the extracted oil from this plant has significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.

N2 - This paper presents the details of a Computational Fluid Dynamics methodology to accurately model the process of mixture preparation in modern Gasoline Direct Injection engines, with particular emphasis on liquid film as one of the main causes of Particulate Matter formation. The proposed modelling protocol, centred on the Bai-Onera approach of droplets-wall interaction and on multi-component surrogate fuel blend models, is validated against relevant published data and then applied to a modern small-capacity GDI engine, featuring centrally-mounted spray-guided injection system. The work covers a range of part-load, stoichiometric and theoretically-homogeneous operating conditions, for which experimental engine data and engine-out Particle Number measurements were available. The results, based on the parametric variation of start of injection timing and injection pressure, demonstrate how both fuel mal-distribution and liquid film retained at spark timing, may contribute to PN emissions, whilst their relative importance vary depending on operating conditions and engine control strategy. Control of PN emissions and compliance with future, more stringent regulations remain large challenges for the engine industry. Renewed and disruptive approaches, which also consider the sustainability of the sector, appear to be essential. This work, developed using Siemens Simcenter CFD software as part of the Ford-led APC6 DYNAMO project, aims to contribute to the development of a reliable and cost-effective digital toolset, which supports engine development and diagnostics through a more fundamental assessment of engine operation and emissions formation.

N2 - Big science initiatives are trying to reconstruct and model the brain by attempting to simulate brain tissue at larger scales and with increasingly more biological detail than previously thought possible. The exponential growth of parallel computer performance has been supporting these developments, and at the same time maintainers of neuroscientific simulation code have strived to optimally and efficiently exploit new hardware features. Current state-of-the-art software for the simulation of biological networks has so far been developed using performance engineering practices, but a thorough analysis and modeling of the computational and performance characteristics, especially in the case of morphologically detailed neuron simulations, is lacking. Other computational sciences have successfully used analytic performance engineering, which is based on “white-box,” that is, first-principles performance models, to gain insight on the computational properties of simulation kernels, aid developers in performance optimizations and eventually drive codesign efforts, but to our knowledge a model-based performance analysis of neuron simulations has not yet been conducted. We present a detailed study of the shared-memory performance of morphologically detailed neuron simulations based on the Execution-Cache-Memory performance model. We demonstrate that this model can deliver accurate predictions of the runtime of almost all the kernels that constitute the neuron models under investigation. The gained insight is used to identify the main governing mechanisms underlying performance bottlenecks in the simulation. The implications of this analysis on the optimization of neural simulation software and eventually codesign of future hardware architectures are discussed. In this sense, our work represents a valuable conceptual and quantitative contribution to understanding the performance properties of biological networks simulations.

N2 - In this article, design optimization was carried out to improve the suction performance and efficiency of a mixed-flow pump impeller. Commercial computational fluid dynamics code and a response surface method were used in the optimization to design a mixed-flow pump impeller. When it comes to a mixed-flow pump, the two main research objectives namely efficiency and suction performance tend to contradict. It is very important that the design technology improves the suction performance while maintaining high efficiency. Meridional plane and vane plane development variables were defined in the design of the impeller. The meridional plane expresses the shapes and sizes of the blades, while the vane plane development describes the impeller inlet and outlet angles as well as the blade angle distribution. The blade angle distribution of the impeller was designed using the traditional method by which inlet and outlet angles are connected smoothly. The surface response method was applied to the design variables of the impeller inlet part in this design optimization because they influence the performance of the mixed-flow pump. Objective functions were set to satisfy the total head at the design flow rate as well as to improve efficiency and suction performance. Design variables of the impeller inlet part of the mixed-flow pump and the changes in performance were analyzed in order to produce the optimal shape. The performance of the optimally designed shape was verified by numerical analysis, and the reliability of the test result was checked by comparative analysis against the reference model.

N2 - The concept of conservation of amino acids is widely used to identify important alignment positions of orthologs. The assumption is that important amino acid residues will be conserved in the protein family during the evolutionary process. For paralog alignment, on the other hand, the opposite concept can be used to identify residues that are responsible for specificity. Assuming that the function-specific or ligand-specific residue positions will have higher diversity since they are under evolutionary pressure to fit the target specificity, these function-specific or ligand-specific residues positions will have a lower degree of conservation than other positions in a highly conserved paralog alignment. This study assessed the ability of reverse conservation analysis to identify function-specific and ligand-specific residue positions in closely related paralog. Reverse conservation analysis of paralog alignments successfully identified all six previously reported substrate recognition sites (SRSs) in cytochrome P450 family 2 (CYP 2). Further analysis of each subfamily identified the specificity-determining residues (SDRs) that have been experimentally found. New potential SDRs were also predicted and await confirmation by further experiments or modeling calculations. This concept may be also applied to identify SDRs in other protein families.

N2 - This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation, and disinformation.

N2 - Pheromones are chemical substances released into the environment by an individual animal, which elicit stereotyped behaviours widely found across the animal kingdom. Inspired by the effective use of pheromones in social insects, pheromonal communication has been adopted to swarm robotics domain using diverse approaches such as alcohol, RFID tags and light. COSΦ is one of the light-based artificial pheromone systems which can emulate realistic pheromones and environment properties through the system. This article provides a significant improvement to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel artificial pheromone system that simulates pheromones with environmental effects by adopting a model of spatio-temporal development of pheromone derived from a flow of fluid in nature. Using the proposed system, we investigated the collective behaviour of a robot swarm in a bio-inspired aggregation scenario, where robots aggregated on a circular pheromone cue with different environmental factors, that is, diffusion and pheromone shift. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed pheromone system for use in swarm robotic applications.

N2 - The interaction between humans and robots is undergoing an evolution. Progress in this evolution means that humans are close to robustly deploying multiple robots. Urban search and rescue (USAR) can benefit greatly from such capability. The review shows that with state of the art artificial intelligence, robots can work autonomously but still require human supervision. It also shows that multiple robot deployment (MRD) is more economical, shortens mission durations, adds reliability as well as addresses missions impossible with one robot and payload constraints. By combining robot autonomy and human supervision, the benefits of MRD can be applied to USAR while at the same time minimizing human exposure to danger. This is achieved with a single-human multiple-robot system (SHMRS). However, designers of the SHMRS must consider key attributes such as the size, composition and organizational structure of the robot collective. Variations in these attributes also induce fluctuations in issues within SHMRS deployment such as robot communication and computational load as well as human cognitive workload and situation awareness (SA). Research is essential to determine how the attributes can be manipulated to mitigate these issues while meeting the requirements of the USAR mission.
