AB  - A fluent ability to associate tasks, concepts, ideas, knowledge and experiences in a relevant way is often considered an important factor of creativity, especially in problem solving. We are interested in providing computational support for discovering such creative associations. In this paper we design minimally supervised methods that can perform well in the remote associates test (RAT), a well-known psychometric measure of creativity. We show that with a large corpus of text and some relatively simple principles, this can be achieved. We then develop methods for a more general word association model that could be used in lexical creativity support systems, and which also could be a small step towards lexical creativity in computers.

AB  - This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.

AB  - Crowd RE is an emerging avenue for engaging the general public or the so called crowd in variety of requirements engineering tasks. Crowd RE scales RE by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd RE, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd RE process, itself, by facilitating novel workflows combining crowd and machine intelligence.To facilitate automated techniques for Crowd RE, first, we showcase a crowd-acquired dataset, consisting of requirements and their ratings on multiple dimensions for the smart homes application domain. Our dataset is unique in that it contains not only requirements, but also the characteristics of the crowd workers who produced those requirements including their demographics, personality traits, and creative potential. Understanding the crowd characteristics is essential to developing effective Crowd RE processes. Second, we outline key challenges involved in automating Crowd RE and describe, how our dataset can serve as a foundation for developing such automated techniques.

AB  - For enhanced education at the level of University courses such as those in biology or biotechnology, one of the key elements is the need of time and expertise to allow the student to familiarize laboratory techniques in par with regular theory. The Sakshat Amrita virtual biotechnology lab project focusing on virtualizing wet-lab techniques and integrating the learning experience has added a new dimension to the regular teaching courses at the University. Establishing virtual labs requires both domain knowledge and virtualizing skills via programming, animation and device-based feedback. Challenges in the biotechnology sector in setting up a laboratory that integrates both the feel and phenomenon includes the medley of multiple techniques. This paper reports one such cost-effective process used in virtualizing a real biotechnology lab at the University-level. The major challenge in setting up an effective knowledge dissemination for laboratory courses was not only the scientific approach of biotechnology, but included the virtualization aspects such as usage/design scalability, deliverability efficiency, network connectivity issues, security and speed of adaptability to incorporate and update changes into existing experiments. This paper also discusses an issue-specific case-study of a functional virtual lab in biotechnology and its many issues and challenges.

There are constraints involved in these protocols due to the mobility and non infrastructure nature of an ad hoc and sensor networks. We study in this research work a probabilistic performance evaluation frameworks and Swarm Intelligence approaches (PSO, ACO) for routing protocols. The performance evaluation metrics employed for wireless and ad hoc routing algorithms is, (a) routing overhead, (b) route optimality, and (c) energy consumption. This survey gives critical analysis of PSO and ACO based algorithms with other approaches applied for the optimization of an ad hoc and wireless sensor network routing protocols.

AB  - Computers have transformed work and play, transportation and medicine, entertainment and sports. Yet for all their power, these machines still cannot perform simple tasks that a child can do, such as navigating an unknown room or using a pencil. The solution is finally coming within reach. It will emerge from the intersection of two major pursuits: the reverse engineering of the brain and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Over the next 20 years, these two pursuits will combine to usher in a new epoch of intelligent machines. Why do we need to know how the brain works to build intelligent machines? Although machine-learning techniques such as deep neural networks have recently made impressive gains, they are still a world away from being intelligent, from being able to understand and act in the world the way that we do. The only example of intelligence, of the ability to learn from the world, to plan and to execute, is the brain. Therefore, we must understand the principles underlying human intelligence and use them to guide us in the development of truly intelligent machines.

AB  - Despite the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, large pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the decision-making process of it in ELBERT. Our code is publicly available online.1

AB  - Students experience constant problems in their introductory programming courses. Along with difficulties to cope with abstract programming concepts students tend to experience fear and lack of motivation to learn programming. In order to make programming more interesting and to make programming concepts easier to comprehend an intelligent assistant which enables students to ask question about their programming lessons in a simple and familiar way just as they would ask the lecturer is proposed. In this way the process of getting the right information and answer gets faster and also more interesting and engaging compared to classic approach. Along with getting the desired answer faster this kind of approach increases motivation of students to spend more time in learning programming because of interesting new technology that is used as an aiding tool in their programming education. The results about students' attitude towards such approach and its effect on students' motivation and amount of time spent in learning are presented and discussed.

AB  - We developed three home-made modeling programs to design thermally assisted magnetic recording heads: optical beam propagation method for waveguides, optical finite difference time domain method for plasmon generators, and thermal/micromagnetic finite difference method for the recording media. These models lead to the following results. To get higher throughput efficiency of the waveguide, the periodic wavy thickness of the inlet can provide better inlet coupling with laser diode light, and the wavy taper shape can improve the propagation efficiency. As for plasmon generators, the model requires waveguide, recording media and main-pole to estimate the correct performance, because the optimized design depends on all of these parts. Our proposed sharp pointed plasmon generator can provide tiny near field spot, and it must have good scalability for narrow track recording. In addition to these optics models, we performed recording process simulation. As a result, depending on the condition of the thermal spot and head field alignment, either thermal or magnetic field can be dominant in creating the final magnetic transition in the media. The signal to noise ratio and the transition curvature are greatly affected by the recording process.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence explores the means for computers to think like a human. In this era of technological advancements, the unobstructed method for monitoring activities in daily life is a challenging task. Most of the recent research successfully achieved good performance at the high computational cost. With high computational costs, it is not possible to deploy action recognition methods in real-time scenarios. This research work aims to develop an action classification approach for video surveillance with scalable extension for deployment on edge devices. The input video is preprocessed extensively to extract the maximum information about the actions with all variants, which enables the network to even recognize the actions from an unseen environment. The Hybrid Video Classification (HVC) is the combination of CNN and GRU that are used for feature selection and preserving the preceding information, and in the end, SoftMax activations are used to classify the action labels. We have used HMDB51 and UT-Interaction datasets to train our proposed model. The model is tested in real-time on low end laptop. The experimentation shows that the proposed work recognizes the actions with better accuracy at a low computation cost.

AB  - In the music industry, researchers have been developing an approach to music as an informational phenomenon for decades. Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.

AB  - Information security risk assessment is the premise and basis for ensuring the security of information systems. Current research on risk assessment focuses on the calculation methods and assessment models of the risk value. Also, lots of automatic assessment tools have been applied to risk assessment. However, these methods didn't take human errors in risk assessment work into consideration, thus couldn't solve the problem brought by the influence of human errors on final assessment results. As a result, this paper introduces the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) which is a mature technique in human reliability analysis into the process of information security risk assessment. Combined with current analysis techniques of human errors in computer science and aiming at the calculation process of the risk value of important assets in information security risk assessment, research on the calculation method of risk value considering human reliability is carried out in this paper. The calculation method of human error rates in the entire process of risk value calculation is proposed. An example is provided to verify the method proposed in this paper.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the question: “Can Information and Communications Technology (ICT) helps to improve primary school students' geometry achievements for rectangles?” The applied educational software consisted of a story and several activities with and without the use of computers which were designed following the background of Realistic Mathematics Education for geometry concepts; referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Model’ (PSM). In addition, we use a mathematical test referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Test’ (PST) to explore the use of ICT in the primary classroom for teaching basic geometrical concepts. It is a task orientated test which attends to measure the level of geometry competence developed for students of the first grade. The study dealt with students in the first grade of primary school of Athens and Crete, who were divided into two teams (experimental and control). The experimental group consisted of 113 students, who were taught of rectangles by the support of computers. There were 121 students in the control group, which received only the traditional science instruction for rectangles. Students in both groups were pre-tested and post-tested for their geometry performance for rectangles. The results of the study indicated that teaching and learning through ICT is an interactive process for children at primary school level and has a positive effect for geometry education of rectangles.

AB  - Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been successfully applied to solving many problems, but in most cases, they are used as black boxes which are not interpretable. That is, even if an MLP can provide correct answers, we cannot understand the reasons why it makes these decisions. In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.

AB  - With the continuous implementation of application services in the field of artificial intelligence in the industry, the academic research on Al branch science is becoming more and more in-depth. NLP, that is, natural language processing, plays an extremely important role in the transition from the in-formation age to the intelligent age. Computer linguistics, a highly interdisciplinary emerging discipline derived from it, is also developing by leaps and bounds. Chinese natural language processing takes the conversion of natural language as the basic principle, follows the research ideas based on rules and statistics, and appropriately adds some reliable examples to complete the translation process. This paper discusses the key problems of computer linguistics based on Chinese NLP, understands the basic concepts of Chinese natural language processing through detailed analysis, and then studies the key problems and steps of Chinese natural language processing.

AB  - This paper synthesizes three fundamental challenges within existing frameworks for the ethical regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) identified in recently published literature. These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.

Educational processes such as university studies, for illustration, are unconventionally expanded towards a casual home office. Web browsers and networking technologies provide access to serious content and direct manipulation technologies allow for some transformation of conventional studies into edutainment. Among the novel features is the opportunity for the learner to casually deal with learning content and to informally present his own work to friends and relatives at home in this way supporting the gradual development of thought in speech, as Kleist put it. Consumer electronics and media technology have set the stage for Kleistian learning demonstrated technically and didactically.

With the advent of the era of film virtual production, film digital assets will become the main role of film art creation. In the face of efficient virtual production rhythm, the use of artificial intelligence and human-machine cooperation technology will greatly improve the efficiency of film art creation. It can not only give greater play to the artists' creative inspiration and ideas, but also make full use of the massive storage capacity and amazing computing speed of the computer. The human-machine cooperation film art creation method will also become one of the main methods of film art creation in the future.

AB  - High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is a standard tool to measure the performance of High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC). There are several parameters which can be optimized to maximize performance delivered by HPCC. HPL provides many such parameters for evaluation of performance. P & Q are two such values which determine the distribution pattern of processes for executing HPL. In this paper HPL runs with different values of P and Q have been carried out for three different values of N while keeping the block size (NB) constant. Value of N represents the problem size of task being executed. Results obtained are included in tables and are also depicted in form of graph and are analytically discussed. These results also provide the basis for deeper analytical approaches for HPCC performance evaluations. This critical analysis also reveals that maximum performance is delivered if the task is evenly distributed over all the available cores and nodes in the HPCC.

AB  - With the increasing demand of power supply reliability from power users as well as the great impact of natural disasters on power supply reliability, it is of great significance in recent years to improve the efficiency of the emergency repair of the distribution network failure after the disaster and restore the power supply as soon as possible. However, the current analysis of the impact of the external environment on emergency repairs is not in-depth, resulting in its model not being able to fully reflect the actual circumstances of the distribution network emergency repairs under the background of disasters, making the actual feasibility of the strategies developed poorly. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, this paper analyzes the characteristics of multi-fault emergency repairs under disaster conditions compared with those under normal conditions, proposes a dynamic impact model including weather, repair sites, and infrastructure, also establishes a multi-fault emergency repair model of distribution network and optimization model of emergency repair strategy for distribution network. The simulated annealing algorithm (Simulated Annealing Algorithm, SAA) is used to solve the problem, and through horizontal comparison with common swarm intelligence algorithms such as genetic algorithm, it proves the advantages of SAA algorithm in calculation speed and ability to find the optimal solution. According to the actual data, the methods and principles of formulating the best emergency repair strategy for the distribution network under the disaster background are analyzed.

AB  - Abstract rules can be learned by several species (not only humans). We propose a biologically plausible model for same/different discrimination, that can point towards the neural basis of abstract concept learning. By including a neural adaptation mechanism to a discriminator model formerly introduced in the literature, selective clusters of neurons fire depending on whether or not the stimuli compared are the same or not. These selective neurons are consistent with experimental findings in the literature. Moreover, reward and attention can modulate the relative strength of each attribute/feature of the stimulus, so more complex abstract discriminations can be achieved using the proposed model as a building block. As a formal model, it can be easily incorporated into several applications in robotics and intelligent machines.

AB  - This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.

The method used for the assessment of employee performance evaluation is the center of ranking and ranking order using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), so as to produce rankings that can be compared with the best alternative results with weighted values generated by each method. To apply the MAUT approach in decision support systems, the determination of employee performance evaluation assessment has the criteria of initiative, team working ability, communication skills, discipline, responsibility, creativity and innovation, customer service, and commitment to company values. This research aims at evaluating employee performance using MAUT and PIPRECIA-S in order to weight the criteria based on the assessment of decision makers more objectively. Based on the process of completing the application of the MAUT method using PIPRECIA-S weighting in the assessment of employee performance evaluation, among the 6 employees as the subjects of the research, the best performance was obtained by employee 4 with a final score of 0.435 as rank 1, and rank 2 was obtained by Employee 1 with a final score of 0.328, while rank 3 was obtained by Employee 3 with a final score of 0.251.

However, it remains debatable about the content or curriculum of computing as a separate subject or as an integral part of all other subjects. A literature study reveals that most of the current high school education focuses on computer as a separate subject and less emphasis on computing and its integration with other subjects. The present work intends to propose a conceptual approach “Computing Implementation for High School Curriculum” with an objective of integrating computing as a part high school education with a multi-dimensional approach. It includes teaching & learning, emphasis on problem solving and supporting academic administration. This can help the stakeholders in the field of education to improve the overall development of our future generation.

The questionnaire is designed from four dimensions: learning motivation, teaching methods, learning methods and learning effects. The results of the questionnaire show that the reasons for the lack of deep learning of computer basic courses are as follows: lack of novel content, too large class size, uneven basic level of students, only shallow learning for examinations and single evaluation method. The conclusion is introducing the teaching concept of deep learning into computer basic courses can change the teaching paradigm for the purpose of knowledge transfer and enable students to deeply participate in and effectively experience learning.

Firstly, some concepts of cloud model theory and grey relational analysis were introduced and an improved forward cloud generator was put forward to normalize the decision matrix of TOPSIS, thus the uncertainty of the decision data was embodied and simulated. Then the steps of the improved TOPSIS were described. The calculation method of the numerical characteristics of the cloud model used to normalize the decision matrix was given. The separation to the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution was calculated by grey relational analysis method which can reflect the trend relationship between the alternative and the ideal solution. The weight of the criteria was calculated on the basis of the exponential scale of analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can provide more evaluation information by its statistical nature.

On the other hand, long short-term memory (LSTM) has been proven in text classification to which we think the ultrasonic rail flaw detection can be quite similar. In this context, this paper proposes a novel text-style sequential modeling method for ultrasonic rail flaw data and a LSTM-based deep learning model for rail flaw detection. Comparative experiments proved the feasibility and remarkable computational efficiency of the proposed modeling method and model.

AB  - Micro-expression refers to facial expressions that last for an extremely short time, typically less than 0.5 seconds. It can reveal a person's true emotion, which is one of the powerful indicators to judge what a person actually thinks. However, the deployment of micro-expression recognition algorithms onto resource-constrained devices poses a challenge due to their high computational requirements. In this essay, we optimize the identification of microexpression algorithms by using pruning-based lightweight methods. By using unstructured pruning and structured pruning methods, the backbone Resnet-18 network model is subjected to local and global lightweight pruning, respectively, where the network structure is optimized to reduce the time and space costs required for micro-expression recognition algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the original algorithm's performance is enhanced following the pruning procedure with fewer parameters, and it exhibits superior performance on the CASMEII, SMIC, and SAMM datasets.

AB  - This position paper proposes that the current enterprise modeling approaches are overly reliant on the know how or tacit knowledge of enterprise architects for addressing organizational challenges such as business-IT alignment. Furthermore, current modeling languages only encourage linear thinking. By drawing upon existing research on (computational) organization theory and multi-agent systems, we propose implementation requirements for a next generation enterprise modeling language that supports agent based simulation.

AB  - We present a practical and efficient stereo matching approach which produces a dense disparity map with the pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming in this paper. Firstly, pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on the dynamic programming is introduced where the optimal alignment of two sequences could be acquired by tracing back the similarity matrix which is constructed according to characters in two sequences using dynamic programming algorithm. Second, we think of pixel gray value of all homonymy epipolar lines in two images in turn as two string sequences, and then disparity of corresponding point in two images is calculated by the number of gaps inserted the optimal alignment in every two string sequences. Additionally, according to epipolar constraint we can know that homonymy epipolar lines in two images parallel to the scan-lines, so the 2D matching of images is simplified to that of 1D. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach is stable and efficient, and it has a high matching accuracy and low computational complexity.

AB  - Within the context of Argentina universities that have computer science degrees in their curricula, one of the major challenges is to teach an introductory programming course for the first semester. The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.

AB  - Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.

AB  - To improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment, a framework of parallel healthcare systems (PHSs) based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) approach is proposed in this paper. PHS uses artificial healthcare systems to model and represent patients’ conditions, diagnosis, and treatment process, then applies computational experiments to analyze and evaluate various therapeutic regimens, and implements parallel execution for decision-making support and real-time optimization in both actual and artificial healthcare processes. In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.

AB  - In mid-April 2020, UNESCO monitored 191 countries and stated that around 1.723 trillion students in the world were affected by the policy of school from home. It is feared that school closures could hamper the provision of education services and could disrupt the education process which will affect the level of quality of education. There is still no creation of a computational model for the spread of covid as the main framework for schools reopening safely during the pandemic situation. Although there is already a framework from WHO and the government, there is no measuring tool that can evaluate the effect of reopening schools while the Covid-19 pandemic. For this reason, this research seeks to produce a model for the spread of Covid-19 as a basis for determining policies for safely reopening schools during the pandemic. In this research, we produced a recommendation to reopen face-to-face learning in the form of a dashboard. Recommendations are given by predicting the number of cases in each subdistrict using a predictive model. The prediction results are also combined with the factors that have been determined by the government to give recommendations. The allotment of recommendations process involves a critical factor analysis process where we identify which factors are dominant as a basis of a controllable pandemic.

The focus of this work is on reporting a teaching and learning experience aimed at introducing the students to the culture of sustainability, by means of a project that utilizes a leading visual programming environment and web 2.0 technologies, and is suitable for a relatively large group. The key idea was to tell a story through a computational artifact, whose development requires critical and creative thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration skills [6] as well as information literacy. This paper describes the pedagogical design of the activities, their objectives, class management issues, and the scaffolds to designing the animated story, to be implemented using a cutting edge, syntax-free visual language called Scratch. Both the humanistic and the scientific aspects were to be covered in each story about a selected topic in sustainability, in order to involve as much as possible of the teaching spectrum and create a truly interdisciplinary environment. The developed Scratch-based solution is also suitable for deployment on mobile devices using the App Inventor visual programming language.

AB  - This paper introduces Data Brushes, an interactive web application to explore neural style transfer using models trained on data visualizations. Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to engage with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, `magic markers', mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, `compositing stamps', uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art in order to investigate the versatility and flexibility of the algorithm. In addition to enabling a novel creative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effects particular networks have on different images, or different regions within a single image. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of style transfer features.

AB  - Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.

AB  - Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.

AB  - In recent years, satellite formation flying has become an increasingly hot topic for both the astronomy and earth science communities due to its potential merits compared with a single monolithic spacecraft system. This paper proposes a novel approach based on closed-loop brain storm optimization (CLBSO) algorithms to address the optimal formation reconfiguration of multiple satellites using two-impulse control. The optimal satellite formation reconfiguration is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraints of overall fuel cost minimization, final configuration, and collision avoidance. Three versions of CLBSOs are developed by replacing the creating operator in basic brain storm optimization (BSO) with closed-loop strategies, which facilitate search characteristic capture and enhance the optimization performance by taking advantage of feedback information in the search process. Numerical simulations are carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), basic BSO, and the three versions of CLBSOs. Comparison results show that all versions of CLBSOs outperform PSO and the original BSO in terms of final results and convergence speed. In addition, CLBSO reduces the computation burden and shortens CPU time to a certain extent in contrast with basic BSO. Furthermore, among the three CLBSO algorithms, the one using the strategy of difference with the best gains the best overall performance, which is inspired by the updating rule in PSO that each particle tends to move towards the individual with the best fitness.

AB  - In Norway, a health reform was recently adopted to improve continuity of care. Services that were carried out in hospitals were transferred to municipalities. Small and medium size municipalities have established inter-municipal cooperation to provide specialized services across borders. The research project eHealth-extended Care Coordination studied the inter-municipal cooperation for assessment of dementia, identifying a need for improved communication and coordination. This paper presents the development process of a collaborative information system for dementia assessment using a user-centered design approach. Mixed methods, such as observations, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire, were used for data collection. The results showed that end-user involvement usefully informed the development. The information system effectively supported collaborative work and shared access to information for the inter-municipal team.

AB  - Industry placements have been lauded as providing benefits to students, industry and academia. While semester-long placements that require a break from study are reported as the most effective, not all students want to extend their course. Short-term placements can also have positive outcomes for student employability, industry skilled-worker supply and enhancement of curriculum. Assessment of student performance though is challenging, as their focus during the placement needs to be on completing tasks for a sponsor. This paper is a case study of a successful short-term placement program used to identify the important factors and components of an assessment scheme for a short-term placement.

AB  - Project Jupyter is an open-source project for interactive computing widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.

AB  - Processes are everywhere. Organizations have business processes to manufacture products, provide services, purchase goods, handle applications, etc. Also in our daily lives we are involved in a variety of processes, for example when we use our car or when we book a trip via the Internet. Although such operational processes are omnipresent, they are at the same time intangible. Unlike a product or a piece of data, processes are less concrete because of their dynamic nature. However, more and more information about these processes is captured in the form of event logs. Contemporary systems ranging from copiers and medical devices to enterprise information systems and cloud infrastructures record events. These events can be used to make processes visible. Using process mining techniques it is possible to discover processes. This provides the insights necessary to manage, control, and improve processes. Process mining has been successfully applied in a variety of domains ranging from healthcare and e-business to high-tech systems and auditing. Despite these successes, there are still many challenges as process discovery shows that the real processes are more "spaghetti-like" than people like to think. It is still very difficult to capture the complex reality in a suitable model. Given the nature of these challenges, techniques originating from Computational Intelligence may assist in the discovery of complex processes.

AB  - Increasing use of heuristic algorithms in various fields of science causes numerous modifications of the original algorithms in need for better performance and efficiency. The main problem of heuristics is time required to find optimal solution. For this purpose, we propose to use parallel processing in the initial phase of heuristic methods to decrease computing time. Implemented technique models migration of individuals by adjusting initial population to required conditions. Proposed approach is simulating parallel processes that take place in human brain while solving tasks. In this case, human intelligence is working parallel on various aspects of the problem to compare them in the end before final decision. Proposed approach is simulating this parallelization of thinking threads in the process of optimization. Presented experimental tests have been carried out and discussed in terms of advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$f∘g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even “well-mixedness”, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.

This approach is versatile, finding applications in fields such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning, adaptive control, and more. It stands as a cornerstone in the realm of intelligent computing. This study bridges the gap between information technology and progressive management methodologies, aiming to adapt outdated financial management strategies to the demands of a digitalized environment, thereby pioneering a centralized financial management paradigm in the digital realm. The focus of this paper is to explore this digitally-centered financial management framework and propose a design tailored to the online ecosystem. Our findings indicate that the concept of smart finance goes beyond a mere blend of "AI and finance." Implementing its technologies involves a unique methodology that thrives on "closed-loop thinking." By gleaning insights from AI applications in diverse sectors, we've outlined the foundational pillars of smart finance application: digital transformation of specialized financial operations, algorithms rooted in financial logic that are fine-tuned through iterations, the fusion of data analytics within financial operations leading to product-centric solutions, and achieving a significant 90.00% platform integration for these smart financial solutions. As artificial intelligence technology continues to evolve, financial management will undoubtedly gravitate towards being instantaneous, user-centric, and intelligent. This will usher in heightened efficiency and benefits, heralding a new age in financial management.

AB  - Significant gap between software programming model and execution model is one major slowing factor in the development of the emerging field of Internet-of-Things. It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.

In accomplishing this, we integrated MATLAB/Simulink, the de facto standard for technical computing into the university curriculum for teaching four Computer Engineering courses namely Numerical Methods, Signals and Systems, Digital Control Systems and Digital Signal Processing during the 2010/2011 academic year at the University of Ghana. The course modules were developed in consultation with others and taught over the period of 13 weeks. The semester examinations consisted of laboratory and written exams sessions of three hours duration. After grading and collating of examinations results, it was clearly demonstrated by students that they have learnt the key requirements in engineering education. The statistics was staggering and interesting; for example 90 students registered the Numerical Methods, one withdrew due to ill-health and 89 students passed the seemingly difficult course with good grades.

AB  - Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.

AB  - In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models’ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.

We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.

AB  - With the progress of science and technology, quantum computing plays an increasingly important role in various fields, solving the traditional arithmetic bottleneck. In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to look at Cloud Computing Security. The term “cloud computing” refers to a way of delivering services over the internet. As a network service, computing resources are made available. These services are cost-effective, scalable, and self-contained. Cloud computing is responsible for the IT industry's rapid growth. Despite its many benefits, it has a number of security concerns that must be addressed. In order to make Cloud Computing even more secure and trustworthy, some efforts must be made against the model's hazards. All of the risks linked with Cloud Computing, as well as potential cures, are evaluated in this paper. Various resources like as memory, software, CPU, and network services are offered on-demand via the internet in cloud computing. Because all resources such as hardware, software, and network are used without physically purchasing them, the company's primary investment in the cloud is retained. Many advances are being implemented in the cloud platform to deliver a better experience for cloud users.

AB  - Is robotics, automation, digitalization, artificial intelligence or any of the current buzzwords really going to disrupt our world? Prof. Dominik Boesl thinks so – in fact, it can even been proven! In order to predict technological breakthroughs, the domains of foresight, future studies and technology assessment offer interesting methods. One of the most know might be the analysis of megatrends. Dominik Boesl is researching the future of robotics, automation and AI and their impact on society out of HDBW (Hochschule der Bayerischen Wirtschaft) in Munich. He is convinced, that our grandchildren will grow up as first Generation R of Robotic Natives – leaving us the last generation of Robotic Immigrants (still with analogue migration background, but …). These future generations will not be afraid of robotics and smart systems permeating their living realm. But technology is never good or bad out of itself – it depends on us how we apply it. The bigger the disruption, the larger the responsibility that comes with it. As chair of the global IEEE TechEthics initiative, Dominik fosters educated discourse about the application of technology and its impact on society and humankind. He is founder and chairman of the Robotic & AI Governance Foundation, pushing for governance structures to (self-)regulate the research, development and productization of automation technologies.

This study aims to develop a sound recognition system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify and identify the gender of catfish based on their speech patterns. The study explores a range of supervised ML and DL algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, to predict the gender of catfish. The extracted features from the audio signals of the catfish serve as inputs to these algorithms, which produce binary predictions classifying the catfish samples as either male or female. This study further explores data analysis of the audio signals from the male and female catfish. The automated sound recognition system proves to be a more efficient and accurate approach compared to traditional methods, which rely on time-consuming visual observations. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, and more, were employed to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the gender of catfish based on speech patterns. Among the employed algorithms, ANN and NB demonstrate the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 89.47%.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.

AB  - This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.

AB  - Many works have been done in an effort to create systems for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes. Although most of them are related to the recipe ingredient lists, few works have been done to evaluate and generate the preparation steps of culinary recipes. This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.

AB  - Recent developments in computational freeform inverse design have provided a fertile landscape of structures and topologies for nanophotonics. However, simply dumping millions of parameters into a simulation can easily lead to intractable computational problems. Fortunately, a given engineering problem often admits many different mathematical formulations, and by carefully matching the formulation to the available electromagnetic solvers and optimization algorithms one can set the stage for extraordinarily flexible automated design. In this talk, we will show that, with careful consideration and reformulation of the design problem, powerful inverse design techniques can be successfully applied to a multitude of interesting problems with rich physical behavior, ranging from light confinement in nonlinear multi-resonant cavities, robust bandgap maximization in 3D photonic crystals to beam-forming and manipulation through multi-layered metasurfaces.

AB  - The design of communication architecture over a sea environment is challenging since it requires careful analysis of different factors such as multipath propagation, antenna characteristics and mobility that affect a signal. Although existing work has addressed a few factors, there is no work which provides a complete analysis of path loss incorporating such factors and how they affect on Received Signal Level. To get a clear picture of what work has been proposed in the literature, we present a survey article that gathers information about various propagation models used and proposed for maritime environment. We analyze each work based on the simulation set up, number of factors considered, error differences between simulated and experimental data and so on. We believe this article will help to identify the current state in simulation and analysis of communication links over the sea environment.

The resources of the production plant are modelled in order to enable the simulation of their functionalities. A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities. Efficient algorithms and technologies for data analysis and prediction are utilized. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be predicted as a result from the simulation of physically-based models, without the machines' operation being stopped, as it happens in the common predictive maintenance solutions.

AB  - AI systems have seen significant adoption in various domains. At the same time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by the inability to fully trust an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides, fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability are vital to developing trust in AI systems. As stated in Describing Trustworthy AI,aa.https://www.ibm.com/watson/trustworthy-ai. “Trust comes through understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were included are crucial to understand.” The subarea of explaining AI systems has come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on “domain knowledge,” including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use. Contemporary XAI methods are yet addressed explanations that enable decision-making similar to an expert. Figure 1 shows the stages of adoption of an AI system into the real world.

AB  - Virtual learning environments have been increasingly utilized in the domain of eLearning recently. Virtual worlds such as SecondLife and OpenSimulator have opened up great opportunities in this front. The major issue with virtual worlds with respect to education is lack of models that consistently describe the entire learning process. Most of the prior work was focused on building tools to extend real world learning tasks to virtual worlds rather than building virtual world based learning models which consistently describe the virtual world based learning itself. The ongoing work presented here is focused on filling the void in virtual world based learning models.

AB  - Plagiarism is known as illegal use of others' part of work or whole work as one's own in any field such as art, poetry, literature, cinema, research and other creative forms of study. Plagiarism is one of the important issues in academic and research fields and giving more concern in academic systems. The situation is even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and minimize the plagiarism among students.

AB  - This is a article of research which bases on the classical granular computing and the Association Rules, focus on the association rules and decision-making rules of the information system. Firstly, defines a association-rule characteristic Information Granule, which can be treated as a sub-definition of the Information Granule, and a association-rule characteristic Information Granularity matirx is defined as well. Secondly, we present a new approach of computing on support degree and confidence degree, which are commonly used in problems of association-rule and decision-rule in information systems. Finally we build a whole knowledge-obtaining algorithm for the association rules and decision-making, and test its availability by numerous experiments.

AB  - A novel modeling method is presented for knowledge intensive representation of engineering objects in product model in order to establish product-wide coordinated decision making during lifecycle of product. The currently prevailing product model space is extended by entities representing human affect driven change attempt, product behavior, change affect zone, and contextual change chain. The purpose of this modeling is utilization of possibilities offered by integrated application of sophisticated product modeling and intelligent engineering in order to establish a contribution to find solution for an actual product model related problem in communication between engineers. This problem has been emerged by the new style of engineering where cooperating humans use product model as a medium. The extended model is called as virtual engineering space. Term engineering space refers to the emphasis on serving engineering processes in virtual space. In this paper, definition of key concepts and placing the research in related works are followed by characterization of current virtual product spaces and the related engineering methods. Main contribution of the paper explains a three sectored multilevel model of product and application of this concept at definition of virtual engineering space. Finally, a human intent based process for decision making on product object parameters is explained as an example for application of the proposed virtual engineering space.

AB  - Different people may have a different learning styles and it is important to provide the most suitable content and course materials for learning. However, determining the learning style may be difficult due to limited information about the learner and lack of a learner profile. The learner has to complete a questionnaire form based on educational theory in order to determine the learning style. Moreover, it is necessary to know the learner's study record related to other factors such as demographic factors. Therefore, an enhanced model to identify learning style is needed. This research aims to address the problem of identifying the learning style for a new student. A learning style classification model was proposed and ensemble classification techniques were implemented. The results showed that the proposed ensemble classification techniques performed better compared to other classification techniques used in the experiment.
