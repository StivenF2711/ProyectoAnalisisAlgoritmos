AB  - As social robots and other intelligent machines enter the home, artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) is taking center stage to address users’ desire for deeper, more meaningful human-machine interaction. To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages–Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.

AB  - In this study, we investigate how a robot can generate novel and creative actions from its own experience of learning basic actions. Inspired by a machine learning approach to computational creativity, we propose a dynamic neural network model that can learn and generate robot's actions. We conducted a set of simulation experiments with a humanoid robot. The results showed that the proposed model was able to learn the basic actions and also to generate novel actions by modulating and combining those learned actions. The analysis on the neural activities illustrated that the ability to generate creative actions emerged from the model's nonlinear memory structure self-organized during training. The results also showed that the different way of learning the basic actions induced the self-organization of the memory structure with the different characteristics, resulting in the generation of different levels of creative actions. Our approach can be utilized in human-robot interaction in which a user can interactively explore the robot's memory to control its behavior and also discover other novel actions.

AB  - We utilise a longitudinal dataset of 17 526 speech samples collected from 30 patients with major depressive disorder and 11 sub-clinically depressed individuals to perform a personalised prediction of depressed mood. The data has been recorded via a smartphone app over a two-week ecological momentary assessment with three recording sessions per day. Each session's speech samples are accompanied by a self-assessed rating on the discrete visual analogue mood scale (VAMS) from 0-10. As these ratings are highly subjective, a personalised machine learning method is leveraged. For this purpose, the beginning of the recording period is utilised to train both a shared model backbone, and adapt personalised layers added at the end to each speaker's speech. Our approach yields a Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) of 0.79 on the test set, compared to the non-personalised baseline of p=0.61. Furthermore, we analyse our results with regard to the type of speech sample - reading three depression-related questions, answering them, and freely formulating an uplifting spontaneous thought. Here, we find that personalisation boosts performance across all types, especially for the fixed content question readings. Overall, our work highlights the efficacy of personalised machine learning for depressed mood monitoring.

AB  - A review of recently published papers demonstrates: simulation practitioners apply the standard methods of inferential and descriptive statistics for their reasoning with simulation generated samples without much critical reflection. Yet, simulation-generated samples differ in important aspects from empirical samples, for which the standard statistical methods have been developed. Simulation models do have inherent epistemic and computational limits for replication that do not exist with empirical data sets. Consequently, neither is simulation-based data generation the same as the collection of empirical data nor is the analysis of synthetic data equally beneficial as of empirical data. These differences are much more fundamental for computer simulation than the problems of specific techniques of inferential statistics which have been criticized recently. If simulation generated data is used for testing research hypotheses the core issue is not the method of statistical reasoning but the assurance of what might be called evidential content.

AB  - The use of MapReduce (MR) model has attracted much attention because of the reductions in the costs involved in satisfying the storage and computational demands. However, authentication methods proposed for such model is subjected with rooms for improvements. In the initial design and implementation of the MR model such as Hadoop, issues of security including authentication was not considered. It was assumed that the underlying system worked in a trustworthy environment, so MR developers did not provide authentication methods in the MR model. This assumption is still valid to some extent, whereas major IT players in the world, such as Facebook and Yahoo have implemented the MR model in their private clouds. However, recently there are efforts to provide the MR model in public clouds. Inadequate authentication methods for the MR model in such environment makes the job execution work-flow vulnerable to many attacks such as impersonation and spoofing attacks. So as part of our work to design a secure and effective authentication solution for the MR model, this paper examines and critically analyses the state-of-the-art in MR authentication methods against a general set of specified requirements. It is to identify limitations, weaknesses, and missing features in the proposed authentication methods for the MR model.

AB  - In this computational study for acquiring syntactic containment constructions, we suggest that emergent structures in the sensorimotor space may help limit the search for linguistic patterns to a much smaller corpus, in which the earliest glimmerings of syntax may originate. We consider an early learner exposed to perceptual data (video) with co-occurring word-segmented commentaries. In the initial stages of an incremental statistical learning process, content words (e.g. object names) are acquired. Then, some prototypical containment categories emerge by clustering spatial relations in the perceptual input. These situational regularities are used to focus only on sentences uttered during containment situations. By using k-gram and path alignment models on this limited corpus, we show that such a system may begin to learn word categories as well as syntacto-semantic constructions such as “into the X”/[IN(tr,X)]. A key step in the process is the structure in which this perceptual knowledge is organized. The term “image schema” has often been used to refer to such structures, but has widely divergent interpretations. We view the image schema as a category oracle; initially limited to spatio-temporal situation, it may extend, with increasing exposure to language, to new situations.

AB  - The presence of artificial agents in human social networks is growing. From chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a socio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition. These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in social-psychological and sociological theory.

AB  - The development of social media in the form of websites and android applications should be appreciated. The background of this research is the stage to develop the software needed to know the age range. The objective thing to observe is through the visitor’s face on the web or application. The purpose is to avoid false information and get the proper process flow. The Technology used is deep learning for facial image recognition. The methods use Convolutional Neural Network with residuals because the advantage is using multi-branch layers but having a stable training process. The use of augmentation is needed to increase the variety of facial recognition image positions and to overcome unbalanced classes. The dataset used consists of seven categories, namely Children, Youth, Early Workers, Middle Ages, Pre-Retirement, Retirement, and Old People, which Bappenas regulate. Each folder contains about 1157 images with a total data of 8,105 images. The training process results can obtain a model with an average accuracy of 99.08% and a computational training time of about three hundred minutes. The model’s accuracy is 99.08%, with MSE 0.0037, RMSE 0.0610, and MAE 0.0037. Testing time is about 2 seconds.

AB  - The emerging Human-Centric Networks (HCN) paradigm shifts the passive role of individuals to an active one, intertwining the uncertainty of network resource usage with human dynamics, which are difficult to analyze and predict. This phenomenon implies an increase in reciprocal interactions between Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and human activities, presenting the challenge of efficiently allocating network resources while taking into account qualitative human uncertainty. In this study, we propose a conceptual model that addresses and quantifies such uncertainties. The proposed model is characterized by its adaptability to various CPSS applications, facilitating its integration into existing applications and future innovations. The adaptability of the model is based on the application of the sociological concept of Boundary Objects (BO), which allows for the structuring of system components and the generation of a reference architecture that facilitates systematic problem solving. To evaluate the model, we propose a use case related to a Vehicle for Hire (VFH) application operating within a 5G network slice. The integration of the proposed model with the OMNET++ simulation framework has allowed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in intricate computational environments and have shown its capacity to incorporate previously overlooked elements that are essential for the optimal allocation of resources in CPSS. This study proposes a methodology for comprehending and mitigating the consequences of human uncertainty, emphasizing the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to resource allocation in sophisticated technological systems.

AB  - Proxy re-encryption (PRE) can guarantee the security of data sharing in the cloud making it important in ciphertext sharing in the cloud computing environment. Plenty of the current PRE algorithms based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem are constructed under the random oracle model or have problems such as long public parameter size, large ciphertext expansion rate, etc. We propose an identity-based PRE (IB-PRE) scheme using the LWE problem with short public parameters which can solve the mentioned challenges. Our scheme uses the blocking operation to decrease the public parameter size and a more useful trapdoor generation algorithm to reduce the trapdoor size. These two technologies improve the computational efficiency of the public key. We think that when we divide the identity id into 16 blocks, without much increase in computational overhead, the public key size can be reduced by 88.34%, and the scheme’s security level can remain unchanged. Our scheme achieves adaptive IND-ID-CPA security. It is unidirectional, collusion-resistant, and constructed under the standard model.

AB  - The increasing computational demands of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, particularly for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles and drones, present significant challenges owing to their extensive neural network complexities. Previous DRL compression strategies predominantly focused on unstructured pruning, effective for reducing model size but requiring specialized hardware for computational acceleration. Conversely, DRL models with structured pruning applied can be accelerated on standard hardware, though they typically encounter performance issues at higher pruning rates due to structural constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced structured pruning methodology, combined with scaled policy constraints (SPC) for DRL models. Our approach overcomes the performance limitations of conventional structured pruning, achieving high pruning rates while maintaining robust model performance. Enhanced performance restoration after pruning is achieved by fine-tuning with SPC and applying structural regularization, thus ensuring efficient decision-making with a minimal computational burden. Extensive evaluations on the D4RL benchmark and in a drone control simulation environment confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our approach maintains performance integrity even at high pruning rates, with less than a 2% decrease in normalized score at 90% pruning in D4RL and preserving cumulative reward at 87% pruning in drone control simulation. Significantly, our approach also enables considerable computational acceleration on standard hardware. We implemented our method on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board and achieved a 2.5-fold speed-up on devices with NVIDIA Volta GPUs and over double the speed-up on those with NVIDIA Carmel ARMv8.2 CPUs. These outcomes highlight our method’s suitability for real-time, resource-constrained applications, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency.

AB  - The interest in deep neural networks for solving computer vision task has dramatically increased. Due to the heavy influence of the neural networks architecture on its predictive accuracy, neural architecture search has gained much attention in recent years. This research area typically implies a high computational burden and thus, requires high scalability as well as availability to ensure no data loss or waist of computational power. Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1,000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Our results show that the introduced multi-objective neural architecture search can easily handle even the loss of nodes and proceed the algorithm within seconds on another node without any loss of results or the necessity of human interaction.

AB  - Privacy requires more than just encryption of data before and during transmission. Privacy would actually demand hiding the sheer fact that communication takes place. This requires to protect meta-data from observation. We think that this feature is in particular useful and interesting for the Internet-of-Things. However, it requires strong cryptographic security mechanisms, like encryption of communication, to be in place. We motivate the need for strong privacy protection by highlighting privacy issues in a smart home use-case. We advance beyond encryption and discuss which existing techniques can be used to achieve unobservable communication. Then we describe the architecture needed to provide strong protection in this particular use-case. Lastly, we present the building blocks of the architecture we implemented so far on the Re-Mote sensor nodes running Contiki OS and sketch the computational and network overheads imposed by these techniques.

AB  - This work investigates the complications of robotic learning using reinforcement learning (RL). While RL has enormous potential for solving complex tasks its major caveat is the computation cost- and time-intensive training procedure. This work aims to address this issue by introducing a humanlike thinking and acting paradigm to a RL approach. It utilizes model-based deep RL for planning (think) coupled with inverse kinematics (IK) for the execution of actions (act). The approach was developed and tested using a Franka Emika Panda robot model in a simulated environment using the PyBullet physics engine Bullet. It was tested on three different simulated tasks and then compared to the conventional method using RL-only to learn the same tasks. The results show that the RL algorithm with IK converges significantly faster and with higher quality than the applied conventional approach, achieving 98%, 99% and 98% success rates for tasks 1-3 respectively. This work verifies its benefit for use of RL-IK with multi-joint robots.

AB  - In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease progress over several years, it slowly ruins memories and thinking ability, and eventually the capacity to carry out daily tasks, leading to full-time care. The brain shrinks and loses brain cells as a result of Alzheimer's disease. While the condition can strike at any age, most patients with Alzheimer's disease are over 65.. Alzheimer patients mostly have Symptoms like memory loss, disorientation and problems with thinking ability but vary from person to person. Although genetics, environment, and lifestyle are the most likely causes of this illness, other experts think there may be multiple causes. The term “dementia” refers to brain illnesses that impair thinking, memory, and behaviour. The most typical cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease typically struggle to speak clearly, identify relatives and friends, and recognise items. They can also become angry, restless, and frustrated. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, physical issues like weakness, loss of balance, and impaired bladder and bowel control appear. In this study paper, we will introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, to recognise Alzheimer's disease. On the input image, image segmentation is carried out. CNN is a group of artificial neural networks that provides a more scalable approach to image classification and identification of patterns in images. Convolution is a mathematical procedure that CNN employs in place of matrix multiplication at one layer. CNN are different from other neural networks by their exceptional performance with audio, image or speech signal inputs. CNN algorithm take an input image, assign priority to different aspects for an image to find difference between images. CNN Captures Spatial and Temporal dependencies of an image using application of relevant filters.

AB  - Whenever anyone focuses attention to solve a problem through Operations Research and Management Science methodology, it is required to address the problem from the perspective of scientific thinking as well as from the thinking of Art side. Sense of both science and arts is required to shape a totality. However, it is noted that much has been written about the science of decision making: mathematical models, solution algorithms, procedures following structural analysis etc. But unfortunately it is observed that relatively very little has been written in the perspective of Arts to solve the problems. There is no denying the fact that the creativity is the most important attribute of good management and it also helps to drill longitudinally and laterally sense of research and innovative ideas and conceptions and things will assume totality as and when both the sense of Arts and Science is meaningfully applied. Thus creativity is very much linked with problem solving but it is observed that it has, ironically, been largely ignored as a very important and forceful weapon of OR/MS problem solving process. In this paper a sincere attempt has been taken to synthesize explicitly OR/MS literature which has got closed link with creative thinking for solving problems and we shall try to provide here a framework for integrating structured creative thinking technologies with regard to OR/MS methodology and we will also discuss in this perspective of its implication for education, research and practice.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has always been an important research topic for applying artificial intelligence in smart healthcare. Sufficient medical data are one of the most critical factors in CAD research. However, medical data are usually obtained in chronological order and cannot be collected all at once, which poses difficulties for the application of deep learning technology in the medical field. The traditional batch learning method consumes considerable time and space resources for real-time medical data, and the incremental learning method often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time medical data processing method based on federated learning. We divide the process into the model stage and the exemplar stage. In the model stage, we use the federated learning method to fuse the old and new models to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. In the exemplar stage, we use the most representative exemplars selected from the old data to help the new model review the old knowledge, which further mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. We use this method to conduct experiments on a simulated medical real-time data stream. The experimental results show that our method can learn a disease diagnosis model from a continuous medical real-time data stream. As the amount of data increases, the performance of the disease diagnosis model continues to improve, and the catastrophic forgetting problem has been effectively mitigated. Compared with the traditional batch learning method, our method can significantly save time and space resources.

AB  - Existing approaches to procedural level generation in 2D platformer games are, with some notable exceptions, procedures designed to do the work of a human game designer. They offer the usual benefits and disadvantages of AI applied to a cognitive task: they can work much faster than a human level designer, and are in some cases able to explore the design space automatically to find levels with desirable qualities. But they aren't able to capture the human creativity that produces the most interesting level designs, and they are usually very specific to their particular domain. This paper introduces occupancy-regulated extension (ORE), a general geometry assembly algorithm that supports human-design-based level authoring at arbitrary scales.

AB  - The curse of dimensionality is a well-established phenomenon. However, the properties of high dimensional data are often poorly understood and overlooked during the process of data modelling and analysis. Similarly, how to optimally fuse different modalities is still a big research question. In this paper, we addressed these challenges by proposing a novel two level brain-inspired compression based optimised multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition. In the first level, the framework extracts the compressed and optimised multimodal features by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based compression on each modality (i.e. audio, text, and visuals). The second level simply concatenates the extracted optimised and compressed features for classification. The performance of the proposed approach with two different compression levels (i.e. 78% and 98%) is compared with late fusion (class level-1 dimension, class probabilities level-4 dimension) and early fusion (feature level-72000 dimension). The simulation results and critical analysis have demonstrated up to 10% and 5% performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) based multimodal emotion recognition systems respectively. We hypothesise that there exist an optimal level of compression at which optimised multimodal features could be extracted from each modality, which could lead to a significant performance improvement.

In response to the threat, various efforts or actions have been initiated such as fact-checking, algorithmic, platform design, and policy changes. However, evidences show the volume of false stories circulated on social media remains high. To solve the problem of fake news needs an interdisciplinary effort, not only technology but also social and political input. We propose a good solution through a collaborative project that develops a trusting news platform by A.I. and blockchain technology and effectively utilizes the common supervisory power of the society. In addition, we propose studies from humanity perspectives in order to give some guide-lines and fundamental base for creating a trusting news ecosystem.

For example, my research demonstrates that people separate both business and professional roles by communicating with separate identifiers. People may have different identifiers for technical reasons, such as difficulties in configuring settings. In addition, corporate security policies place restrictions on people's communications which influences the way people manage identifiers. I conducted a series of in-depth interviews with two groups sampled from different populations.

AB  - We consider the problem of constructing critical paths from incomplete information. In general, a directed acyclic graph of tasks with their execution times (i.e., a task graph) is necessary to extract critical paths. We assume, however, that only the set of tasks, and their start and end times are known, e.g., an execution trace in the form of a Gantt chart. This information can be extracted from real machines or from the output of analysis tools, whereas extraction of the exact task graph often is problematic due to imperative modeling formalisms and complicated platform semantics (resource allocation, varying execution speeds). We show that, based on start and end times only, an over- approximation of the critical paths of an unknown task graph can be extracted nevertheless. Furthermore, this approach is generalized to deal with "noisy" execution traces of real machines in which control overhead is present. Finally, we discuss various methods to deal with false positives, and apply our approach to a complex industrial case study.

AB  - Today, the advancement in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) pave the way for establishing a simulated three-dimensional world for educational purpose and interactive learning. AR technology witness an increasing usage in recent years in the learning process of several areas of knowledge. However, using AR in education is still a big challenge and limited. There are certain constrains linked to the perception of learners to use AR as well as it is unclear to what extent this technology improves the spatial performance of learners in certain academics. Another question this study tries to answer, why AR is more effective than VR in preserving knowledge in learners’ minds. The purpose of this paper is to review the most important theories and reports on AR in education, and its connection to human spatial memory. The review of literature reveals that VR is an efficient technology and provide good tools for spatial memory research, but it still not compared with respect to spatial performance with AR. The significant impact of AR on learning ability of student is high by creating a sustainable and immersive education environment which enhance students’ spatial memory, especially in academic fields that are based on visual topics.

AB  - From the perspective of information security engineering, ISO/IEC 15408, one of ISO/IEC security standards, plays an important role to ensure the whole security of an information/software system. ISO/IEC 15408 is a complex security standard which requires involvement of wide range of participants to perform a quite number of tasks as well as various documents. ISO/IEC 15408 is periodically reviewed and maintained to achieve ongoing improvement so that workflow of tasks and contents/format of documents related with the standard are changed according to changes of the standards. Consequently, it is difficult to do all of the tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 without any supporting tools. However, there is no study to identify which tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 can be supported by software tools. Indeed, no one makes clear what the tasks and participants exist. This paper presents the first analysis to identify all software supportable tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408. The paper enumerates all of the participants, documents, and tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 and shows relationship among them, and identifies all software supportable tasks. The analysis and its results become a basis to construct an information security engineering environment based on ISO/IEC 15408 for ensuring the whole security of an information/software system.

AB  - A fuzzy node is a fuzzy set whose membership function contains some uncertain parameters. Two fuzzy nodes are connected if the uncertain parameter of one node is provided by the fuzzy set from the other node. A fuzzy network is a connection of a number of fuzzy nodes. We define Gaussian Fuzzy Networks and study a number of basic connections in details, including basic center, basic standard deviation (sdv), basic center-sdv, chain-in-center, chain-in-sdv, self-feedback and some other connections. We derive the membership functions resulting from these connections that reveal how the fuzziness is propagated through the networks, and we explain what the mathematical results mean with respect to human behaviors.

AB  - Scientific creativity refers to exploration of original scientific development/creation. Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferably in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored by acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.

AB  - Work design theory research has a long and rich tradition in the industrial and organisational psychology. Work design identifies tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities in a specific job. It provides a comprehensive job description useful for examining and creating optimal working conditions, also by developing empowering workers or by restructuring their responsibilities. Human-robot interaction is among the domains with a high demand for work design. It is related to the widespread human fear of being replaced by machines at work, as well as the still small number of publications in this field, mostly devoted to human-robot interaction analysis conditions. Scholars have identified an elaborated set of tasks by a human during working with a robot. From work design perspective, besides expanding what tasks are considered, it is crucial to consider its meaning for creating critical psychological states, which are important for individual and organisational results. Thus, the paper preparation’s impetus describes and analyses the tasks carried out by robot operators in a more precise manner, by using psychological work analysis from the work design perspective. The research group consists of 32 robot operators from a large international manufacturing company. The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) was used to describe 21 of work characteristics. Results show that Task Variety, Information Processing, Task Identity, Specialisation, Skill Variety, Problem-solving, Task Significance, Received Interdependence, Feedback From Others, and Feedback from Job are the highest work characteristics of robot operators. It suggests that robot operators distinguish non-routine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks as more substantial than other tasks. Alike, according to the work design theory, the work characteristics indicated by respondents are recognised as important job-specific factors for workers’ critical psychological states i.e., experiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts, and helping shape the context of the work. It is imperative that further and more extensive research is conducted to bring more attention to how work design can support individuals’ cognitive, social, and identity development in human-robot interaction.

AB  - this paper examines the relationships between job satisfaction and selected personality traits. The main task of this study is to emphasize the role of personality traits in the employee's job satisfaction and to study the impact of personality traits such as neuroticism, extraversion and psychoticism on job satisfaction. The variables include big five personality traits and job satisfaction. The main focus of this work reveals that there is no substantial link within the following big five factors and the job satisfaction. The above-mentioned factors would importantly impact on job satisfaction. The examination of linkage between factors like neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and job satisfaction was carried out using the correlation analyzing. This study was conducted to collect the main data using the purposive sampling method. The distinctive feature of this study is the collection, processing and analysis of consolidated information from personal questionnaires depending on the type of professional activity of the sixty employees in aviation industry. Two questionnaires i.e. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-revised (EPQ-R) and Job Satisfaction Survey were used to make an assessment of the impact of personality traits on the overall level of job satisfaction. The future impact of this study can support to increase the productivity level of the employees and also, spread awareness about the positive impact of extraverted personality traits on the job satisfaction.

AB  - Monotone prediction problems, in which the target variable is non-decreasing given an increase of the explanatory variables, have became more popular nowadays in many problem settings which fulfill the so-called monotonicity constraint, namely, if an object is better in all attributes as another one then it should not be classified lower. Recent approaches to monotone prediction consider linear ordering on attribute domains, thus the meaning of being better in an attribute is limited to having a larger or a lower value in that attribute. However, this limitation restricts the use of recent approaches in cases where middle or marginal values of an attribute are better, what is natural in many real-world scenarios. We present a simple attribute value-transformation approach in this paper. The idea is to map attribute domains to real values where the mapped values express how the given value of an attribute contributes to higher classification of objects. Thus, we are searching for an data-specific approximation of a fuzzy membership function on the domain of each (numerical) attribute. Then, instead of the original attribute values we use their mapped values to mitigate the violation of monotonicity constraints in the data. Our approach is quite simple and is not limited to numerical attributes only. The described approach was tested and evaluated on benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

AB  - One of the main goals of the Arabic world since decades has been to search, bring and deliver new sources and forms of art in the field of interior design and architecture that could satisfy the recent increasing human demands. Today people strive to showcase their tradition and cultural heritage in the modern world. People of Arabic Peninsula are all about representing the beauty of their Islamic culture in unique contemporary ways that would astonish the world. Arabic calligraphy is one of such sources. The distinctive geometric shapes and forms of different character types and styles like Kufi, Naskh, Diwani, Thuluth etc., gives designers the opportunity to design and develop exquisite pieces of art in both interior design and architectural field. The design elements of modern interior design act as a guiding principle infusing this art form in design. Modern Arab interior and architectural designs are incredibly unique yet sophisticated and luxurious. The usage of calligraphy in design can prove to be a substantial method of portraying history and culture expressed through the character of letters to be used in furniture, columns, ceiling, architectural buildings etc. This paper shows how Arabic calligraphy is not limited to just traditional decorative purposes but can have much wider application at both macro and micro level in modern world of design. It is a great source of inspiration for designers attempting to integrate the art of calligraphy in design of modern furniture as well as architectural structures. The paper demonstrates how designers like Zaha Hadid, and many others borrowed this traditional art form, infused it with modern touch and took it to new heights of contemporary design through their modernized lenses and vision. The ravishing amalgam of calligraphy and design can give birth to some magnificent and timeless masterpieces in future.

AB  - Summarizing a body of information is a complex task which mainly depends on the ability to distinguish important information and to condense notions through abstraction. Considering a knowledge representation partially ordering concepts into a directed acyclic graph, this study focuses on the problem of summarizing several human descriptions expressed through sets of concepts. We formally define the problem of summarization in this context and we propose a model mimicking a Human-like Intelligence for scoring alternatives with regard to a specific objective. Several interesting theoretical results related to this problem (e.g. for optimization) are also given. Finally, the evaluation of the proposed approach performed in the domain of odor analysis highlights the benefits of our proposal and shows how it could be used to automatize time-consuming expert summarizing processes. Source code implementing the proposed approach as well as datasets are made available to the community1.

Horizon scanning is the systematic process of examining the scientific literature to identify opportunities, risks, threats and emerging issues. This tool has been named the Autonomous information Comprehension Engine (AiCE). AiCE has the ability to ingest large quantities of unstructured text based data from a variety of sources, extract a wide variety of features and analyse trends across the corpus of collected source material. AiCE is used to analyse science and technology literature and identify developments which may be of strategic relevance to a specific domain. In this paper AiCE is introduced and its components are outlined. The benefit of the proposed system is demonstrated through a time expenditure study comparing this new system to the traditional manual process of horizon scanning. The proposed system is also demonstrated by analysing literature from the computer vision community to extract relevant research to the natural language processing community.

AB  - Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) has been studied in ways never before possible because to breakthroughs in brain imaging technology. Indirectly, the accuracy and interpretability of findings affect our understanding of neurodevelopmental processes, highlighting the crucial necessity of dependable techniques. There are a wide variety of obstacles to overcome in this field, from the intricacies of researching developing brains to the subtle interplay of different cognitive processes. Overcoming these problems demands creative approaches and enhanced procedures that can capture the changing character of cognitive growth. The goal of this framework is to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cognitive neuroscience studies, leading to a deeper comprehension of the complex mechanisms at play during brain development. In this study, there is a method called functional magnetic resonance-based tensor imaging (FMR-TI) that combines the strengths of both methods to provide more precise mapping of cognitive growth throughout time. As a bonus, the suggested method uses simulation analyses to verify its efficiency and resilience in capturing the nuances of cognitive development, making the results of the study more trustworthy. The proposed methodology can be used to a wide range of fields, such as educational neuroscience, clinical psychology, and developmental neuroscience. Understanding cognitive growth better has far-reaching effects on educational programs, diagnostic methods, and treatment plans. Moreover, this methodological improvement holds promise for unraveling the neurological foundations of neurodevelopmental diseases, helping to the development of focused therapies and tailored treatment strategies. The robustness of the processing, the flexibility of the paradigm, and the validity of the simulation are all taken into account during the investigation.

AB  - Collaboration performance is often enriched by the interaction of a diversity of personalities and opinions in a team. There is little research on discussion-assistance systems to monitor and control the state of diversity and cohesion of opinions. This study proposes a system that guides participants to concentrate on differences in their opinions and to reach a decision with more satisfied agreement by encouraging cognitive empathy (i.e., understanding others’ thoughts). The system evaluates the similarity of opinions among participants, then it provides feedback on the similarity score to them. Receiving the feedback, participants can determine the necessity of the exchange of opinions to converge the discussion (not debate). We prepared a team-building task in which two participants alternately presented their opinions based on individual thoughts and emotions; then, they checked the similarity between their opinions and discussed cooperatively them to reach an agreement. We show that the feedback of opinion similarity score increases cognitive empathy, which is also objectively validated by observation of brain activities. Particularly, we observed the strong phase-synchronicity of theta wave between the discussion participants’ left lateral prefrontal cortexes. Satisfaction of participants with the result of the discussion marginally increased and the similarity score of their opinions significantly increased along with the task process. In conclusion, the feedback system during the team task promoted positively the consideration of their own and their partner’s emotions and thoughts. This study also contributes to hyperscanning studies in real-life situations because it used a simple electroencephalographic device and experimental design in communication.

In this paper, we consider the some important field of machine learning conduct a critical survey and analysis of machine language security and its importance, attacks and threats, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape in cybersecurity. We begin by elucidating the fundamental concepts and terminologies associated with ML attacks, laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration. Subsequently, we categorize and dissect various types of ML attacks, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model inversion, and membership inference, among others. Real-world case studies and examples across different domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing, are scrutinized to reveal the intricacies and implications of these attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate existing defense mechanisms and countermeasures, assessing their effectiveness against different attack scenarios. Finally, we discuss the broader societal impacts and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of ML technologies in security-critical applications. this paper provides the tools to handle the machine language’s attacks and their solution using integration of academic research with real world examples.

AB  - With the appearance of 2D graphical user interfaces in the 1980s, users began to carry out most operations on 2D icon-based interfaces instead of using line-based terminals. With the emergence of smartphones in the 2010s, the notion of portable 2D graphical user interfaces was born, and by today, users accessing digital services are no longer tethered to a single location. All of these advances have led to immense changes in our conceptualization of digital information systems, the effects of which are difficult to overestimate. Recent developments in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to lead to the next major breakthrough in this series of cognitive expansions, bringing to the forefront portable, context-aware spatial interfaces. A consequence of these developments is that users are expecting to be able to access a growing multitude and variety of digital content in ways that are increasingly contextualized and personalized, i.e., relevant to the time, location and topic from the perspective of the users’ personal history. In this paper, we propose an adaptive content labeling and storage model that is suitable to these challenges. Our model, called the Graph-Indexed Tensor Store (GITS) has the benefits of being adaptive and personalized, while also allowing for content retrieval to be carried out based on associative search operations. In a preliminary analysis of the model, we address the challenges of what we refer to as syntactic, semantic and pragmatic saturation, and provide ways to quantity and further explore their effects.

AB  - Individuals aged 20 years and over are considered. We identified participants as having diabetes if they had a HbA1c level greater than 6.5 %. People with diabetes who say they do not actually obtain care is deemed to be untreated for the purposes of this research. In this research, we used logistic regression to assess which risk factors were correlated with untreated diabetes. The aim of Review Machine learning (ML) is to diagnose, cure, and prevent diabetes. While a number of ML models have been created, they are not relevant to real- world scenarios yet. There has been a significant disconnect between ML architects, health care researchers, physicians, and patients in their technologies. Our aim is to perform an in-depth analysis on ML to recognize the potential and shortcomings of the technology. Recent advances in the development of insulin delivery devices, diabetes retinopathy diagnostic methods, and other medical studies have significantly helped people diagnosed with diabetes. Compared with these, the usage of statistical methods for diabetes treatment is only at an early level. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs several highly creative ideas to get their drugs to the consumer. Description ML offers a fantastic chance to handle diabetes with improved strategies and technology.

AB  - TikTok has rapidly become the most popular social media application which offers creative and entertaining features. However, its excessive consumption carries the risk of addiction along with significant distraction. Multiple studies have found that the use of social media has also been linked to an increase in the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and suicide ideation. The aim of this research is to identify and investigate the potential destructive impact of TikTok on society, specifically on the mental health and well-being of young people. This study quantitatively evaluates the data collected from an online survey distributed to a large number of young Tiktok users. The study explored the nature and extent of TikTok usage among young individuals and examined the potential impacts of TikTok usage on mental health outcomes. The researchers have found that gender differences linked to self-assessment, addiction and the fear of missing out (FOMO) could lead to more anxiety, depression and worsen self-esteem. However, pressure for higher visibility support creativity and skill development while longer TikTok usage leads to addiction as in the case of other social media platforms.

AB  - With the development of human science and technology, applications of computer are more and more comprehensive. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to drawing, thinking, and problem solving becomes a significant topic. Recently, research on automatic composition using AI technology and especially evolutionary algorithms is blooming and has received promising results. A common issue at the current evolutionary composition systems is their requirement for subjective feedback of human sensation as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts. These weights obtained can interpret the music style and render an objective measure of compositions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve satisfactory compositions.

AB  - Quantitative financial analysis requires repeated computations of the same functions with the same arguments when prototyping trading strategies; many of these functions involve resource intensive operations on large matrices. Reducing the number of repeated computations either within a program or across runs of the same program would allow analysts to build and debug trading strategies more quickly. We built a disk memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. Anymemoization solution should be easy to use, minimizing the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate, while at the same time giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space used for caching. Guo and Engler proposed a similar tool that does automatic memoization by modifying the python interpreter, while the packages Jug and Joblib are distributed computing tools that have memoization options. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of the above packages for memoization, but at the same time give a higher degree of control of how caching is done for users who need it. We provide the same basic features as these other libraries, but allow control of how hashing is done, space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking. This should lead to both increased productivity and speed increases for recomputation. We show that for several financial calculations, including Markowitz Optimization, Fama French, and the Singular Value Decomposition, memoization greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99%. We also show that by using xxhash, a non-cryptographic hash function, instead of md5, and avoiding equality checks, our package greatly outperforms joblib, the best current package.

AB  - Classification is the key and most widely studied paradigm in machine learning community. The selection of appropriate classification algorithm for a particular problem is a challenging task, formally known as algorithm selection problem (ASP) in literature. It is increasingly becoming focus of research in machine learning community. Meta-learning has demonstrated substantial success in solving ASP, especially in the domain of classification. Considerable progress has been made in classification algorithm recommendation and researchers have proposed various methods in literature that tackles ASP in many different ways in meta-learning setup. Yet there is a lack of survey and comparative study that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. To fill these gaps, in this paper we first present a literature survey of classification algorithm recommendation methods. The survey shed light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifier selection through meta-learning and comprehensively discusses the different phases of classifier selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we critically analyzed and summarized the existing studies from the literature in three important dimensions i.e., meta-features, meta-learner and meta-target. In the second part of this paper, we present extensive comparative evaluation of all the prominent methods for classifier selection based on 17 classification algorithms and 84 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of classifier selection methods and highlight the limitations and strengths of meta-features, meta-learners and meta-target in classification algorithm recommendation system. Finally, we conclude this paper by identifying current challenges and suggesting future work directions. We expect that this work will provide baseline and a solid overview of state of the art works in this domain to new researchers, and will steer future research in this direction.

AB  - The main content of this study is the human-machine collaborative design research, taking the car body design as the carrier. The research framework focused on two phases of car body design process, that of design ideation and evaluation. In the ideation stage, we trained an imperfect Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model that just could generate blur automobile images as the blur design motherboards for the iterative sketching, which had design uncertainties and blanks, thus activating designers’ subjective initiative and aesthetic intuition to provide more creative deepen sketches. We leveraged motherboards to address uncertainty through sketching and aesthetic intuition, refining options and ultimately selecting an optimal design. In the evaluation phase, we initially constructed a parametric 3D model with 20 parameters based on the optimal design, and invited 32 designers conducting participatory design experiments, getting 1024 human-designed schemes. Following this, we administered an online survey to assess the aesthetic qualities of a total of 1024 design schemes. Leveraging the collected score data (The first round of surveys engaged 279 participants, while the second round involved 73 participants), we trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to serve as an aesthetic evaluation score predictor for unknown parameter configurations. The machine could evaluate designs autonomously, thus selecting best design from 20,000 schemes generated randomly by machine. We utilized the parametric design converting sketching images to the numeric parameters, switching the qualitative ideation to the quantitative evaluation, thus achieving aesthetic evaluation and optimization. This study explores the relationship between human cognitive intuition and machine intelligence and how they can collaborate with each other.

AB  - LncRNAs have been discovered to play important roles in biology processes and progression of some severe genetic diseases, such as cancer. However, a number of lncRNAs is lack of function annotations. To understand the functions of lncRNAs is a key step for biology and medical research. Computational method is more suitable for large-scale experiment than biological experimental method due to time and expense, and it can provide reference and basis for biological experiment. Nonetheless, developing computational method to predict function of a newly detected lncRNA is still a challenging task. Some lncRNAs work according to binding with proteins, so calculating interaction preferences of lncRNA-protein may provide novel breakthrough to develop new computational approaches. In this work, we propose a novel lncRNA function prediction method to link function of lncRNAs and RNA binding protein. The method consists of two steps: firstly, we improve the CNN models of DLPRB, a high-performance deep neural network for protein-RNA binding preferences prediction, secondly, we apply a voting algorithm to predict lncRNA function by integrating binding preference predicting models. As we know, it is the first time that using RNA-protein preferences to predict function of lncRNAs. We test the predicting approach with 25 lncRNAs from LncBook, and the results confirm our approach makes sense. The approach only uses sequence-based features, so it can be a novel choice for newly detected lncRNA function prediction. We think this work can provide new insights for lncRNA research.

AB  - With advances in circuit design and sensing technology, the acquisition of data from a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors simultaneously to enable more accurate inferences has become mainstream. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the fusion of multimodal and multiresolution data obtained from several sensors. The proposed model enables the fusion of multiresolution sensor data, without having to resort to padding/ resampling to correct for frequency resolution differences even when carrying out temporal inferences like high-resolution event detection. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for sleep apnea event detection, by fusing three different sensor signals obtained from UCD St. Vincent University Hospital&#x2019;s sleep apnea database. The proposed model is generalizable and this is demonstrated by incremental performance improvements, proportional to the number of sensors used for fusion. A selective dropout technique is used to prevent overfitting of the model to any specific high-resolution input, and increase the robustness of fusion to signal corruption from any sensor source. A fusion model with electrocardiogram (ECG), Peripheral oxygen saturation signal (SpO2), and abdominal movement signal achieved an accuracy of 99.72&#x0025; and a sensitivity of 98.98&#x0025;. Energy per classification of the proposed fusion model was estimated to be approximately 5.61 <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>J for on-chip implementation. The feasibility of pruning to reduce the complexity of the fusion models was also studied.

AB  - Most HPC clusters are now based on an x86 architecture and Linux. In a Grid consisting of such clusters, users might think that a single executable file, a data set, and a single job script will work in all cluster environments. However, due to the lack of interoperability of MPI library implementations, file systems, and batch job systems, users need to be conscious of the runtime environments over the Grid. In order to overcome such differences, we propose a runtime environment called Xruntime consisting of the following three components. MPI-Adapter is middleware between the user program and an MPI implementation to make it possible to execute a single executable code on different MPI implementations. Catwalk is transparent file staging middleware that makes remote files accessed by an application visible as if they were located in the local system. Xruntime allows a user to use various clusters with single batch job script language the user is familiar with, without learning other batch job script languages used on other clusters.

AB  - Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.

AB  - Although there are many systems designed to engage people in programming, few explicitly teach the subject, expecting learners to acquire the necessary skills on their own as they create programs from scratch. We present a principled approach to teach programming using a debugging game called Gidget, which was created using a unique set of seven design principles. A total of 44 teens played it via a lab study and two summer camps. Principle by principle, the results revealed strengths, problems, and open questions for the seven principles. Taken together, the results were very encouraging: learners were able to program with conditionals, loops, and other programming concepts after using the game for just 5 hours.

AB  - Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.

AB  - This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML.

AB  - This study reports the use of a physical robot and robot simulator in an introductory programming course in a university and measures students' programming background conceptual learning gain and learning experience. One group used physical robots in their lessons to complete programming assignments, while the other group used robot simulators. We are interested in finding out if there is any difference in the learning gain and experiences between those that use physical robots as compared to robot simulators. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of students' learning between the two approaches. However, the control group that uses the physical robot shows a more positive response in their attitudes towards computing. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to engaging students and challenges in using physical robots from the learner perspectives and ways to alleviate this. Finally, by considering the insights from students' comments, we also suggest an alternative that may give both benefits of using both physical robots and robot simulators.

AB  - Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.

AB  - Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions.

AB  - Recursion is a powerful conceptual tool, nevertheless it is often considered too abstract and technical to be effectively proposed in lower secondary school. Here we present our experience in introducing 8th graders to recursive strategies where the active observation of recursive algorithms execution allowed pupils to understand the main features of a recursive process, to convince themselves that it works, and to unveil the mystery of its effectiveness. In fact, by focusing on the self-similarity of the input data and the possibility to delegate blindly the solution of subproblems, pupils were able to recognize the heuristic potential of recursion. We started with an unplugged activity using LEGO bricks where a recursive algorithm was executed by pupils, and we continued with an activity supported by a software tool we developed ad-hoc. The undertaking was concluded by the abstract consolidation of the basic concepts and properties which had come out during the previous activities.

AB  - In order to strengthen the interest of students in the field of programming, robots are increasingly being used in courses of study with information technology content. This article describes the use of the robot Vector, manufactured by Anki, in a controlled laboratory experiment with undergraduate students. The aim of the research was to investigate the influence of robots on the motivation of programming beginners from the perspective of the students. The data of the study was collected using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The subsequent analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and Chi2-tests. In addition, a computer-aided content analysis as well as a factor analysis was used as a second evaluation method. The research results showed a consistently positive influence of the Vector robot on the motivational behavior of the students. In particular, significant dependencies between the female gender and individual subcategories of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory could be demonstrated. The generalization of the research results is limited due to the small sample size and the exclusive participation of programming beginners.

AB  - Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.

AB  - This Full Paper of Innovative Practice research shows results that could help to avoid some challenges faced by those who seek to learn how to program. To help improve learning, educators need a deep understanding of the obstacles students must overcome; otherwise, teaching strategies will be uncertain. Moreover, a shallow understanding of topics learned in introductory programming courses can negatively influence the learning of future topics. With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially. The main contribution of this paper is a theory that describes the connections among topics of learning how to program, showing the influence that knowledge about one can have on others.

AB  - During the height of the CoViD-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, schools throughout Europe have been closed for several months, leaving teachers with the responsibility of providing distance learning through video conferencing and remote-presence systems, while parents were scrambling for appropriate tools and support. School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the “CodyTrip” event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. Findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism.

AB  - Computer programming courses are mandatory for many majors. However, the high rate of failures shows that students have difficulties in assimilating the topics. The objective of this research is to understand these difficulties. Analyzing diaries filled out by students and interviews with instructors, we identified difficulties related to language and understanding and some strategies used to mitigate them. The analysis and understanding of the difficulties may support the creation of teaching strategies and tools to facilitate the teaching and learning of computer programming.

AB  - This study aims to explore educational methods for conceptual modeling for novices. The subjects of this study are primarily Grade 9 students in secondary school who are enrolled in compulsory education. This study relies heavily on model-driven development (MDD) and a domain-specific language (DSL). Using MDD, learners are not asked to write code, but rather to create a model to evaluate their model by observing the behavior of the target device. Teachers can control the difficulty of the problems assigned to their students by using a DSL. In this study, we describe our research approach using MDD and a DSL and then show our experiment design and results. We also discuss the qualitative and qualitative effectiveness of UML programming in Technology class for Grade 9 students.

AB  - Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives.

AB  - Coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech world. At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized. In conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to have positive consequences in the programming learning process, providing a starting point for the development of a tool that contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics found and analyzed in this document.

AB  - Worldwide we see an increasing focus on implementing STEM, CT and Educational Robotics, within K-12 curricula and the British BBC and the Danish DR, have provided more than one-million pupils with the micro:bit technology. However, research show that breadboards and circuit diagrams, can be difficult to understand. In this paper, we have evaluated a set of tools and materials - designed to support the teaching of electronics and CT, for use with micro:bits, breadboards and circuit diagrams - by integrating them in a case study of a robotics course for 7th grade primary school pupils (n=21). The tools and materials consist of 3D-printable covers designed to visualize the internal connections of a breadboard, and a new type of circuit diagrams, incorporating visual cues from the these, into their designs. Results show that the tools and materials ease the learning of the breadboard and of how to use and interpret circuit diagrams. Furthermore, the tools and materials, have been made available free of charge.

AB  - Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience.

The aim is not to keep AI a black box and at the same time to be recognized as a transferable literacy with multiple learning benefits per age group of students. In order to strengthen this perspective, the design of workshops to introduce the basics of artificial intelligence to middle school students according to educational neuroscience principles is presented. With these workshops, the importance of AI literacy is emphasized, and students are given space for hands-on activities. The proposals are based on the axes of perception, representation and reasoning, learning, physical interaction, and social impact and include sections on Introduction to Machine Learning, Machine Learning Application Examples, Supervised Learning, and Training-Test Processes, Unsupervised Learning, and Machine Learning Algorithms.

AB  - The purpose of the REACH (REmote ACcess to smart Home facility) platform is to allow students to learn about basic principles of computer science and software engineering practices, and gain hands-on experience through observable effects of the computing systems in a familiar setting (home). It utilizes virtualization to encourage group collaboration and grants anytime, anywhere access to the smart home facility. It incorporates dynamic binding capability that allows students to either use the sensors and actuators hardware they check out and install locally for development, or to conduct experiments in the smart home facility. Once the development is completed, the programs can be deployed remotely, and students can make observations through web cams strategically situated in the smart home facility and the logs of the system's operations and users' activities. The REACH platform is designed to support a large spectrum of computer science courses, from the equivalence of computer science lab 101, interdisciplinary projects, all the way to research projects in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, and human computer interactions.

AB  - The original concept of space has emerged in Paleolithic times from the concept of orientation. Its appearance cannot be interpreted as a random event, but it must be seen as the result of considerable brainwork. Current operational structures of cognition appear rooted in prehistoric thought. Pictograms, ideograms and logograms signify fundamental steps for the later emergence of the linear writing and linear time as history and thought. Binary logic and elementary first order propositional calculus are an important aspect of language and seems to have little in common with the perception of objects in space. Nevertheless, we show that classical logic can be derived from the primeval concept of orientation that has emerged in human cognition during Paleolithic worship activity. From there, all higher thought structures can be developed. Thought is a neuronal filter for the perception of that which is. Understanding this deep layer of thought is vital to develop highly competitive, reliable and effective cognitive robot and brain-inspired system.

AB  - Within the framework of public policies that promote the incorporation of programming and robotics in the compulsory educational system in Argentina, at the Universidad Nacional del Nordeste, training actions are carried out to prepare teachers of pre-university educational levels with the technological and pedagogical competencies necessary to address the challenge of teaching programming in schools. In this work the preliminary results of the implementation of the Diploma in Programming and Educational Robotics are shown. The interest that this training arouses is highlighted by the participation of teachers from locations far from the headquarters of the dictating academic unit, from different areas of knowledge and with a motivation in line with the objectives of this educational proposal. Likewise, it is also verified that teachers have incorporated the knowledge and techniques of programming and have consolidated competencies for digital culture, such as collaboration, communication and creativity, necessary to achieve a more effective and motivating learning in students.

AB  - This article presents methods for correct decomposition for high performance computations related to large sets of graphs. These computations contain large number of calls of sequential, recursive algorithm for NP-complete problem - proper edge coloring of graph. Decomposition of this computational problem is not trivial, since the number of recursions in various parts of the computation is different and causes a high load and time imbalance. We designed, implemented and experimentally verified a new decomposition method that significantly reduces the computational time for a large set of graphs (up to 404 million graphs). This method ensures the same duration of computational time for partial subtasks and thus eliminates the need to wait for synchronization of parallel computations.

AB  - Big data will bring revolutionary changes from life to thinking for society as a whole. At the same time, the massive data and potential value of big data are subject to many security risks. Aiming at the above problems, a data privacy protection model for big data platform is proposed. First, the data privacy protection model of big data for data owners is introduced in detail, including protocol design, logic design, complexity analysis and security analysis. Then, the query privacy protection model of big data for ordinary users is introduced in detail, including query protocol design and query mode design. Complexity analysis and safety analysis are performed. Finally, a stand-alone simulation experiment is built for the proposed privacy protection model. Experimental data is obtained and analyzed. The feasibility of the privacy protection model is verified.

AB  - Software as a Service (SaaS) has the potential to transform the way information-technology (IT) departments relate to and even think about their role as providers of computing services to the rest of the enterprise. The emergence of SaaS as an effective software-delivery mechanism creates an opportunity for IT departments to change their focus from deploying and supporting applications to managing the services that those applications provide. A successful service centric IT, in turn, directly produces more value for the business by providing services that draw from both internal and external sources and align closely with business goals. Despite the promised benefits of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) -- greater flexibility and scalability, infrastructure cost avoidance, "anywhere access" to applications and data -- concerns about security and governance have made some organizations hesitant to turn over a chunk of their IT systems to a third-party service provider.

AB  - Through observation of a large number of numerical simulations in engineering application, we find that the resonance response calculation of traditional volume-surface integral equation (VSIE) method based on volume equivalence principle (VEP) is not accurate enough. We are used to thinking that this is because of the mismatch of normal component of electric fields on medium-metal interface. However, in this paper, through strict formula derivation, we proved that the normal boundary condition of electrical fields and the continuity equation of electric currents at the medium-metal interface are implicit in the solving process of VSIE with method of moment (MoM). We agree that not the normal component but the tangential component mismatch is responsible for the frequency deviation of VSIE simulation. Furthermore, the singularity treatment of Green's function with singular term extraction is also presented in this paper with strict deduction in special case of model discretization with quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, which would be quite useful for reducing the number of unknowns, improving the matrix condition and enhancing the accuracy for electromagnetic simulation in FSS (frequency selected surface) or IC (integrated circuits) applications.

AB  - The design of sophisticated control systems have led in the past ten years to the necessity of satisfying more than one design criterion. Thus, it is natural to think that those criteria can be met in an optimal manner. If several criteria have simultaneously to be optimized, one is in presence of a Multi-Objective Optimization problem. However, the search process of an optimum requires a very high computation burden and the convergence can be very slow. In this paper, the most popular Pareto methods are compared by solving a parametric MOO problem of controller design.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder that causes memory and thinking skill loss. Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.

AB  - Enhancing student academic performance and transdisciplinary ability is challenging, but the time and effort put into accomplishing this ambitious feat is priceless. We develop secure privacy preserving across Personal Health Data (PHD) repository and single-cell genomics research for building an Innovative Systematic Pedagogy for Integrated Research - Education (INSPIRE) (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/csce17_awards). In this paper we further build a novel, eclectic, and insightful framework based on classical and popular machine learning approaches to help us meet the educational challenge. Our framework focuses on using integrative research technologies to help solve “Education’s Performance Prediction Data Mining Crisis” (EPPDMC), by putting to rest issues associated with mining and making best use of big data for educational enhancement, such as multi-source education acquisition, data fusion, and unstructured data analysis. We exploit the uses of deep learning, text classification, and semi-supervised learning approaches to solve challenging problems that educators face when analyzing multiplatform big data involved in education, research and training students. Based on new machine learning approached we developed for genomic big-data research and in combination with machine learning methods (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/keynotes_lectures/yang_talk) and the vast availability of education data available to us, not only can we utilize structured, unstructured, and even multi-media data, but while engaging in leaning intelligent thinking along the way, we can also maximize the utilization of big data by studying the motion and performance of these data. Hence we build the INSPIRE model that can further incorporate Student Face Expression in Class (SFEiC) to help educators and managers make further improvements as they become involved in the teaching-learning process. This research further facilitates the effectiveness of the INSPIRE model.

Each exam is designed to match a single learning outcome of the course. The theoretical background that the study is based upon is the Metacognitive Awareness Framework. We are reporting that the effort that the Faculty and teaching staff will put in test regarding is time well spent and the students' retention and learning improved as reported statistically in this paper, from speaking to the students and from looking at the scores after the retakes. The students get a chance to think stress-free about the problems they struggled with during regular exam time. We perceive the retake exams as a take-home exam where the students have seen once before.

AB  - In an increasingly technological world, it is becoming more important to be able to fix equipment as it breaks down. In many places, it seems like companies do not focus on such abilities, whether it is through the design of the product, some form of warranty, or Digital Rights Management companies trying to get in the way of repairs. This trend may have been going on for longer than we think, with many companies seemingly changing focus at some point. Nevertheless, what are the benefits of device and product repair? Why not just throw out the broken product and buy a new one? In this paper, we will give a history of the right to repair and discuss how long the anti-repair engineering trend has gone on. We will also go into the potential costs and benefits of engineering with the right to repair in mind and the expenses that come with the current way companies operate. In the end, this paper should inform how, as a whole, the greater world could benefit from right to repair legislation and design. We also intend to cover the potential benefits of the right to repair for businesses that normally impede the right, in addition to the tangible benefits of applying Six Sigma to right to repair.

If one can get recovery from early-stage which is, suicidal ideation, it is possible to reduce the number of suicides per year. Our study aims to detect suicidal ideation from social media-based using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have applied the best feature extraction methods- Genetic and Linear Forward Selection (LFS) to select the best features from our feature vectors using our proposed formula. Moreover, We have created a robust feature set based on different computational and linguistic features. Finally, we have shown that by applying our hybrid feature extraction method we can get a significant increase in our accuracy to detect ideation.

Serious Games are one of these kinds of applications, aiming as purpose education or training tasks for users considering entertainment too. Augmented Reality games require appropriate devices for satisfactory experience, as well a usability evaluation to ensure the application's efficiency. With this in mind, this study presents a systematic review to identify approaches that use Mixed or Augmented Reality games in the teaching-learning process of medical contents, and that execute at least one preliminary evaluation with users. Only six selected studies attend the eligibility criteria. We notice a lack of Mixed or Augmented Reality serious games in many medical areas, such as hematology. This work also verified that the evaluation process of these games no adopts a standard protocol or well-known instruments available in the literature for usability evaluation, revealing an opportunity for new studies.

The main idea behind the system is to identify billboards by using a set of image features. These functions are used to train neural net-works, so it can also be applied to other applications. What are the benefits of using neural networks? Compared with traditional methods (such as regression analysis and clustering algorithms), neural networks have many advantages because they can provide better results at lower computational cost than these methods. The billboard recognition system is based on neural network. Neural network architecture of billboard recognition system in this paper, we will discuss how to use python programming language to create a neural network for recognizing images and texts. We will also learn how to train neural networks using a back propagation algorithm with an example data set and a 94% accuracy score.

AB  - Often, textual data is accompanied by images in an attempt to help the user better understand the content. Drawing inspiration from this, it would be interesting to transform any given text into a digital image collage, an artistic graphic object. To automate the process, we developed a software system that uses Natural Language Processing to summarize large paragraphs of text, retrieves images from databases, and arranges them with a Genetic Algorithm on a digital canvas. Given that certain images may be more important to the user, the software computes emphasis factors for scaling the images in the collage. We performed computational experiments to validate each module of our system and initiated user studies to examine their perception of the collages.
