AB  - Two main recent achievements of the first decade in this new century in model space based during product definition are representation of corporate knowledge in product model and extended application of contextual feature principle. Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.

AB  - A question that is often arose on career management is how to choose potential employees to become chief and achieve performance target based on employees' historical data. This research attempts to answer the question and tries to determine what factors can affect an employee to become a chief and capable to achieve performance target. To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees. If organization wants to select potential employees to become chief and predicts them achieving their target, classification techniques should include all employees as the population and avoid to choose only subsets to ensure the confidence of result. Meanwhile, KL-Divergence function generates competencies that affect employee who become a chief and achieve the target. They are achievement orientation, adaptability, analytical thinking, communication and information seeking.

This paper proposes the Feature Prototype Model (FPM) to represent the design knowledge of a product with its design features and prototypes. Accordingly, a product conceptual space is constructed using FPM with Wikipedia data, which is a giant database of manually defined concepts and semantic relations. Through case studies, we propose that the FPM based product conceptual space presents the knowledge involved in design activities and depicts the cognitive environment involved in design thinking.

AB  - The research focus of computer chess is how to use computer to abstract and formalize the logical thinking activities of human beings in chess game. This paper designs and implements a No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning. During the game, MCTS algorithm is used to explore the legal situation under the current situation. In this process, the convolutional neural network is used to evaluate the explored situation. Then, the neural network is trained to evaluate the situation with the results of the match, so as to achieve the effect of self-improving algorithm without human experience. In addition, the author used the Union-Find to find the legal landing point on the chessboard. Finally, the experiment shows that this type of No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning can be improved by itself and reach a certain level of chess ability, which improves the efficiency of searching legal moves compared with the traditional No-Go chessboard traversal method.

AB  - The cloud model is good at bridging the gap between qualitatives and quantities, and so it was applied to evaluating mildew degree of rice seeds based on machine vision. A symmetric cloud and two asymmetric clouds were designed to express three qualitative concepts and the relationship between them. These three qualitative concepts represent different mildew degree including non-mildew, spot mildew and severe mildew. The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way. An experiment was conducted to test on the classifier based on cloud and another classifier based on neural network. The results showed that the classification accuracy of cloud classifier was higher than the classification accuracy of neural network.

With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the naïve approach of searching information on the syntactic web is cliché. Why do we think that the web would be improved, if it understood the meaning of its contents? Doesn't it understand it now? Google is very good at correcting typing mistakes, figuring out what I “meant” when I miss-typed a query or suggesting keyword to expand our search query. In this paper we redefine the idea of searching optimised information on the web using Capture-Recapture method. This paper also explains an optimised semantic searching of keywords and detailed explanation and simulation on Ontology of Indian Universities.

AB  - In the domain of industry control, PID control is the basic algorithm, which has been used for a long time because of its simple structure, easy realization and many other virtues. For many simple control objects, PID control could easily achieve perfect effect, but for some complex object the effect is not so perfect. The submarine maneuver control system is a nonlinear six degree of freedom model, which has the great inertia variational parameters and many other complex characters. It is difficult for single PID to control the system because of the complex characters. In many instances, the best control is obtained in the manual mode using experienced operators. Fuzzy control translates the thinking of experienced operators into control algorithm, which has proven effective for complex, nonlinear, imprecisely-defined model. In order to advance the control effect, fuzzy theory is introduced and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The result shows that fuzzy PID control designed for the unstable nonlinear model of submarine maneuver respond more rapidly and robustly than single PID control.

However, traditional teaching of public psychology makes students feel it very difficult to understand and think psychology is not useful in reality. In order to change the situation, we produce a cooperative-learning model based on network for public psychology in university. This teaching mode involves a series of procedures, that is, fixing on study units and objectives, organizing learning groups for cooperative study, constructing web study environment, monitoring and guiding throughout the study process, providing feedback and appraisal for cooperative learning as well. In a word, with the tools of e-mail, ICQ, QQ, BBS, the cooperative-model in public psychology based on web helps to facilitate students' communication with one another, stretch space-time of traditional classroom, and promote resources sharing.

AB  - Artificial neural network (ANN) community is engaged in biological plausibility issues these days. Different views about this subject can lead to disagreements of classification criteria among ANN researchers. In order to contribute to this debate, two of these views are highlighted here: one is related directly to the cerebral cortex biological structure, and the other focuses the neural features and the signaling between neurons. The model proposed in this paper considers that a biologically more plausible ANN has the purpose to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities, including learning processes, of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models upon which the proposed description is based takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and inter-neuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses. Also, the duration of action potentials is taken into account. In addition to the characteristics for encoding information regarding biological plausibility present in current spiking neuron models, a distinguishable feature is emphasized here: a combination of Hebbian learning and error-driven learning.

AB  - In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.

AB  - Dance choreography is an intense, creative and intuitive process. A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities. Though it is not impossible, the choreographer being human cannot explore, analyze and remember all these variations among steps due to large scale of available options. Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count. The details of experimental study performed for the Genetic Algorithm based art to SMart (System Modelled art) system along with the results obtained are also presented in this paper.

AB  - A positive collaboration between students and professors in any course regardless of the offering mode, i.e., online or in-class setting, can play a significant role in students' success in the class. Thus, any model of teaching/learning should include a unique component of human interaction (i.e., interaction between instructors and students) to make such models appropriate for implementation. The nature of online courses is such that there is no physical interaction between the instructors and students. Thus, the development and implementation of these models, with constructive collaboration between students and instructors in mind, is more challenging for the instructors. In this paper, we examine issues related to the partnership between students and instructors in online courses and propose steps that can be taken to make this collaboration not only feasible but also effective in persuading students to participate in the partnership throughout the semester actively.

AB  - Concept elicitation is a fundamental methodology for knowledge extraction and representation in cognitive robot learning. Traditional machine learning technologies deal with object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, and behavior acquisition. This paper presents a supervised machine knowledge learning methodology for concept elicitation from sample dictionaries in natural languages. Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base. The results of machine-generated concepts demonstrate that the AMCE algorithm can over perform human knowledge expressions in dictionaries in terms of relevance, accuracy, quantitativeness, and cohesiveness.

AB  - The computation technology is evolving. The data transmitted and generated using them are growing exponentially. The traffic on these networks requires surveillance. Effective network traffic surveillance, packet analysis and rules to define the traffic flow are in place using various intrusion detection and prevention systems. However, the security issues and concerns are dictating the need to evolve with the novel and `human-like' methods to mitigate them. Normal methods and techniques may prove too tedious, and sometimes will not even render fruitful results. In that case, the techniques that can think, act and mimic human beings assure the possibilities of resolving the concerns where the domain of artificial intelligence plays a critical role. Also, there is a crucial need to design real-time models that can analyze & handle bigger, more complex data; and deliver faster as well as accurate results. Machine learning is a subfield which possesses all of the attributes. Intrusion preventions IDPS's integrate methods that help to prevent intrusive and non-intrusive data packets [2]. According to survey, most of the intrusion prevention methods rely heavily on humans to analyze data and classify into intrusive and non-intrusive networks. When the data to compute is very large, computing methods such as Computational intelligence and its constituent are essential to use as humans have their own shortcomings. Computational intelligence and machine learning are widely used to detect the intrusions, which in turn help in preventing the same. Pattern recognition uses algorithms to handle very large data sets. In this paper, a survey is done that on various machine learning and computational intelligence techniques that envisage using IDPS.

AB  - With the development of ICT and Big Data, a new education paradigm has been attracting attention by utilizing techniques to efficiently grasp large amount of articles and fairy tales and so on. For example, even in the same event and subject, new version-type articles or fairy tales are pouring out of myriad times and regions. This paper proposes machine learning based fast reading algorithm to identify elements of an important story that are handed down in spite of temporal and spatial differences using the version of 72 similar folk tales of the folk tales "Red Hat" which exist in Europe, Asia, Africa etc. To do this, we analyze the factors depending on the existence of various versions in a decision tree and conduct research using R language tree and caret package. Through the evaluation of the analytical model, we confirmed the existence of the unchanging core elements of traditional talks, which are handed down to the constraints of time and space, and the possibility of a model that intuitively understands them. The result of this study is expected to be used as a new educational field for ICT - based computing thinking (CT).

AB  - Saliency detection by human refers to the ability to identify pertinent information using our perceptive and cognitive capabilities. While human perception is attracted by visual stimuli, our cognitive capability is derived from the inspiration of constructing concepts of reasoning. Saliency detection has gained intensive interest with the aim of resembling human ‘perceptual’ system. However, saliency related to human ‘cognition’, particularly the analysis of complex salient regions (‘cogitating’ process), is yet to be fully exploited. We propose to resemble human cognition, coupled with human perception, to improve saliency detection. We recognize saliency in three phases (‘Seeing’ - ‘Perceiving’ - ‘Cogitating), mimicking human's perceptive and cognitive thinking of an image. In our method, ‘Seeing’ phase is related to human perception, and we formulate the ‘Perceiving’ and ‘Cogitating’ phases related to the human cognition systems via deep neural networks (DNNs) to construct a new module (Cognitive Gate) that enhances the DNN features for saliency detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that established DNNs to resemble human cognition for saliency detection. In our experiments, our approach outperformed 17 benchmarking DNN methods on six well-recognized datasets, demonstrating that resembling human cognition improves saliency detection.

AB  - The world is grappling with a serious problem: many young individuals are taking their own lives. There is also a challenge in understanding the rising trend of this tendency. It is essential to explore the reasons driving people of all ages to consider suicide and find ways to encourage them to choose life instead. In the modern era, social media acts as a crucial platform where people share their thoughts, activities, and emotional states. This has led to the consideration of whether analyzing social media posts could help discern whether individuals are experiencing joy or sadness, particularly to detect levels of sadness that could indicate suicidal thoughts. This paper employs artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze the social media posts of individuals to gauge their mental state, specifically targeting signs that might indicate a risk of suicide. The study has found a high frequency of suicidal thoughts among those who appear depressed on social media. This research investigated the possibility to identify the likelihood of someone contemplating suicidal through their online behavior. This research demonstrates the potential of utilizing social media analysis to identify and support individuals at risk of suicide, providing new insights into recognizing and assessing suicidal thoughts and representing a significant advancement in suicide prevention efforts.

For automatic cheque number recognition, a back propagation artificial neural network with single input layer, one hidden layer and single output layer is implemented. The work aimed to analyze the performance of the system by varying the regularization parameter i.e learning rate. Performance of the system is also analyzed using the learning curves to determine whether it has high bias or high variance. From the result of learning curve the optimal training sets required for the accurate recognition is decided. The performance of the system is analyzed by using correct detection which is defined as the ratio of correctly recognized digits to the total number of digits in the test set. The computational complexity for the training of 2094 data set is achieved around 909 seconds.

AB  - Learning to use computational tools is a critical aspect of many first-year engineering courses. Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers.

AB  - Many real-world decision making (DM) problems present changing contexts in which uncertainty or vagueness appear. Such uncertainty has been often modeled based on the linguistic information by using single linguistic terms. Dealing with linguistic information in DM demands processes of computing with words whose main characteristic is to emulate human beings reasoning processes to obtain linguistic outputs from linguistic inputs. However, often single linguistic terms are limited or do not express properly the expert's knowledge, being necessary to elaborate richer linguistic expressions easy to understand and able to express greater amount of knowledge, as it is the case of the comparative linguistic expressions based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets. Nevertheless, current computational models for comparative linguistic expressions present limitations both from understandability and precision points of view. The 2-tuple linguistic representation model stands out in these aspects because of its accuracy and interpretability dealing with linguistic terms, both related to the use of the symbolic translation, although 2-tuple linguistic values are still limited by the use of single linguistic terms. Therefore, the aim of this article is to present a new fuzzy linguistic representation model for comparative linguistic expressions that takes advantage of the goodness of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model and improve the interpretability and accuracy of the results in computing with words processes, resulting the so-called extended comparative linguistic expressions with symbolic translation. Taking into account the proposed model, a new computing with words approach is presented and then applied to a DM case study to show its performance and advantages in a real case by comparing with other linguistic decision approaches.

AB  - In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, marked by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and robotics, the role of engineering education stands as a cornerstone of sustainable progress. Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.

AB  - The need for more post-secondary students to major and graduate in STEM fields is widely recognized. Students' motivation and strategic self-regulation have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM classes. But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation. Implications for STEM education are discussed.

AB  - Teaching students how to code in K-12 classrooms is considered as one of the major keys to promoting engineering education in the future, which can potentially enhance the competency and computational skills of students to adhere better learning outcomes in higher education. The success of promoting coding education or integrating it into school curriculum depends on the perceptions of teachers and headmasters in schools, and how well they believe on coding education and prepare for the innovative teaching and learning. In this exploratory research study, it reports the results of a large-scale quantitative questionnaire surveying 42 primary and secondary schools (n = 42) in Hong Kong, where computer programming has not been regulated as a compulsory course in K-12 curriculum. The questionnaire aims to investigate the school belief on coding education and their practical challenges while integrating it into their regular school curriculum. Our results show that there is a trend in the local schools promoting coding education with positive perceptions on teaching and learning. However, teaching challenges are also mentioned in the survey waiting for solutions, such as lack of teachers training and unified curriculum. Therefore, the empirical experiences of these schools have set forth the future research direction in design and implementation of coding education in K-12 classrooms not only in Hong Kong but also in the globe.

AB  - This paper is a sequel to “A novel approach to evolutionary computing: an introduction” in which I describe how the modern software can be viewed as a complex adaptive system and how software evolution can be placed or mapped in parallel to the Darwinian Evolution Theory of biology. Calling it a novel approach to evolutionary computing because, instead of working toward genetic computational approaches to biology, it studies complex adaptive systems in software as if software is the same among biological populations that abide by evolutionary theories of biology. This paper explores the relationship between complexity study as a scientific endeavor and systems thinking as a problem solving skill while approaching to generic software solutions, known as Computational Intelligence, to any problem of our interests at hand. The paper argues that skills in systems thinking are critical and applying them may add values to software development activities, especially to large-scale complex software aiming for the high quality and rapid productivity. Examples will be provided to support arguments in the paper.

AB  - Puzzles have long history and have been developed by many people. Nowadays computers are contributing very much to the evolution of puzzles. First computers were used to make arithmetical puzzles, like 'arithmetical restoration' or 'crypt-arithmetic,' then to make mechanical puzzles, like 'burr puzzles' or 'polyomino puzzles' and to make pencil and paper puzzles like 'sudoku.' So now puzzle creators of all genres use computers and they can make more beautiful puzzles with computers than before. Computers changed not only puzzle creators, but also puzzle solvers. Now many puzzle solvers are also computer programmers, and they enjoy puzzles by finding the way of solving puzzles by computers. Of course humans and computers are different in the way of thinking, so computer-solving isn't usually the intention of puzzle creators. But some puzzles are especially for computer programmers and we can say such are new tendency in the puzzle world.

AB  - The difficulty of grid-enabled application development is one of the obstacles to employ grid as infrastructure of scientific computing. Although there are many projects, especially grid workflow projects, trying to make grid-enabled application development easier and quicker, the process-based application description model adopted by most of the grid-enabled applications still bothers scientists who are usually beginner in programming. In this paper, a data dependency based application description model is proposed, which describes a grid-enabled application via dependency among data items in the application, and much close to the thinking pattern of scientists. Based on this model, a scientific computing oriented grid application description language (SCO-GADL) is proposed, and an engine for supporting its execution is designed and implemented. The extensible plug-in architecture adopted by SCO-GADL and its engine makes them support different grid and non-grid platforms easily. At last, a test shows that grid-enabled scientific applications can be developed easily in SCO-GADL, and executes correctly on the application engine.

AB  - Recruiting students according to classification is a new pattern of recruiting and cultivating student, and is an important step of deepening teaching reform. Our college began to recruit students according to mathematics classification from 2010. In order to adapt to the new cultivating pattern and cultivating target, we adjusted the teaching plan of mathematics major, increased class hours of basic courses, and greatly reduced class hours of professional compulsory courses, especially computer courses. Therefore, it is necessary to reform computer teaching. This paper discusses the reform of computer teaching towards mathematics major students from four respects: course integration, teaching material construction, teaching mode and examination ways, and points out that we should give full play to the professional advantages, and integrate into mathematical knowledge and mathematical thinking in computer teaching, to embody characteristics of mathematics major.

Then we present the M2M (macro to micro) data structure which maintains a finite set of n points in the plane under insertion and deletion of points in amortized O(1) time per operation and O(n) space usage. In addition, as the insert operation of each point is independent, the algorithm has high parallelism. And because the insert operations will not cause the imbalance of the tree structure, the M2M data structure is dynamic. Moreover, it can be shared by all the algorithms based on M2M model which greatly improves the efficiency when a variety of algorithms work simultaneity, such as in image processing and pattern recognition. In all, the M2M model points out a general pattern for designing high parallel algorithms, an efficient strategy for solving multi-operational problems and a new approach for computer to stimulate the thinking pattern of human beings.

The aim is helping legal practitioners to be able to focus not only on the decision itself, rather the correlations between them and combining of their variations as well. This way a "hybrid" thinking would be performed. The system will be able to "think through" a great number of possible variations of decisions and their combinations synchronized with the speed of the human mind.

AB  - With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.

AB  - The sixth-generation (6G) network will shift its focus to supporting everything including various machine-type devices (MTDs) in an every-one-centric manner. To ubiquitously cover the MTDs working in rural and disastrous areas, satellite communications become indispensable, while mobile edge computing (MEC) also plays an increasingly crucial role. Their sophisticated integration enables wide-area edge intelligence which promises to facilitate globally-distributed customized services. In this article, we present typical use cases of integrated satellite-MEC networks and discuss the main challenges therein. Inspired by the protein structure and the systematic engineering methodology, we propose three minimal integrating structures, based on which a complex integrated satellite-MEC network can be treated as their extension and combination. We discuss the unique characteristics and key problems of each minimal structure. Accordingly, we establish an on-demand network orchestration framework to enrich the hierarchy of network management, which further leads to a process-oriented network optimization method. On that basis, a case study is utilized to showcase the benefits of on-demand network orchestration and process-oriented network optimization. Finally, we outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure, and greener integrated network.

This paper demonstrates a method of analyzing written material to determine whether or not a person is suicidal. The method involves an analysis of word frequencies that are used in a fuzzy cognitive map. The fuzzy cognitive map determines if there are suicidal tendencies. The method could have substantial potential in suicide prevention as well as in other forms of sociological behavior studies that also might exhibit their own identifying patterns.

AB  - Reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) system has emerged as a promising avenue to achieve high communication performance while adapting to versatile commercial wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to optimally program a reconfigurable RF system in order to achieve maximum performance and/or minimum power. Our key idea is to adopt an equation-based optimization method that relies on general-purpose, non-convex polynomial performance models to determine the optimal configurations of all tunable circuit blocks. Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification. A reconfigurable RF front-end example designed for WLAN 802.11g demonstrates that the proposed method successfully finds the globally optimal configuration, while other traditional techniques often converge to local optima.

AB  - It has been observed that many networks arising in practice have skewed node degree distributions. Scale-free networks are one well-known class of such networks. Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further, a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS algorithm.

AB  - Initial programming education is a topic that con-tinues to spark much debate, as it is an academic field with a notably high rate of student dropouts and failures. The challenge of offering this subject through distance education adds to the complexity, given the need for students to adapt to this mode of teaching and learning, which significantly differs from traditional classroom settings. Multiple studies suggest that students must appropriately develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills for effective learning. Yet, there is a pressing need for further investigation into the impact of non-cognitive skills on student performance, with a particular focus on motivation, which plays an important role in student success. In this sense, considering the specificities of learning programming, the context of distance education, this research aims to understand the factors that can stimulate students' motivation for initial learning of programming, developing a virtual learning environment that promotes student motivation to learn to program and evaluate the environment to identify whether its features have the potential to stimulate student motivation.

AB  - This article is about explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for rule-based fuzzy systems [that can be expressed generically, as $y({{\bf x}}) = f({{\bf x}})$]. It explains why it is not valid to explain the output of Mamdani or Takagi–Sugeno–Kang rule-based fuzzy systems using IF-THEN rules, and why it is valid to explain the output of such rule-based fuzzy systems as an association of the compound antecedents of a small subset of the original larger set of rules, using a phrase such as “these linguistic antecedents are symptomatic of this output.” Importantly, it provides a novel multi-step approach to obtain such a small subset of rules for three kinds of fuzzy systems, and illustrates it by means of a very comprehensive example. It also explains why the choice for antecedent membership function shapes may be more critical for XAI than before XAI, why linguistic approximation and similarity are essential for XAI, and, it provides a way to estimate the quality of the explanations.

AB  - Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.

Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in an educational context where adoption and practical use is growing, facilitated by more powerful and affordable VR headsets. Teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and its applied use can be challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of SG, VR, and the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis in the design of a game. The goal is to develop mathematical thinking skills and increase student engagement and retention through the use of gamification in the creation of a highly engaging and pedagogically sound immersive learning experience.

In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.

AB  - A STEAM-based approach to education is presented that encompasses science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), with the addition of “the Arts” as a means of reversing continuing declines in science, math, and reading scores in U.S. secondary schools and to better prepare future STEAM scholars and professionals. This is despite the significant emphasis U.S. schools have placed on STEM curricula for nearly the past 20 years. The 2014 New York State Department of Labor report states, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has indicated that the United States needs at least one million more STEM workers than is currently available. The report also cites that 75 percent of students who graduate with a STEM-related degree do not take STEM jobs; however, the need for STEM careers is 2.5 times higher than other fields within New York State. A case study of Project Fibonacci® is presented whose approach is one of immersive learning that emphasizes math within a STEAM context, holding focused STEAM educational forums, and establishing centers of excellence in STEAM education. This may offer additional benefits beyond traditional STEM-only approaches. There is an upward trend towards STEAM-focused curricula driven by the decline in academic scores, which provides more challenges for our youth to compete in the global workforce; and recognizing that STEAM builds upon math as the interconnection between the science and art disciplines, thus expanding career opportunities and experience that ensure a well-rounded citizenry. We are rediscovering the need for balancing the cognitive and logical sides of the brain with the creative force to engender an agile, growth-driven nationwide community.

AB  - The abnormal pause or rate reduction in breathing is known as the sleep-apnea hypopnea syndrome and affects the quality of sleep of an individual. A novel method for the detection of sleep apnea events (pause in breathing) from peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals obtained from wearable devices is discussed in this paper. The paper details an apnea detection algorithm of a very high resolution on a per-second basis for which a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network- which we termed SomnNET- is developed. This network exhibits an accuracy of 97.08% and outperforms several lower resolution state-of-the-art apnea detection methods. The feasibility of model pruning and binarization to reduce the computational complexity is explored. The pruned network with 80% sparsity exhibited an accuracy of 89.75%, and the binarized network exhibited an accuracy of 68.22%. The performance of the proposed networks is compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-and-see") and active ("here-and-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples.

AB  - There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.

AB  - The general principle of the operation of neural systems is considered, which makes clear the efficiency of information-computational structures consisting of neural-like elements. At the heart of the formulated principle lies the highly anticipated hypothesis of I.P. Pavlov that the "correctly organized" modifications of the connections between the elements and structures of the nervous system is the basis of "higher nervous activity of man" (in the terminology proposed by Pavlov). The possibility of a clear formulation of the principle, which is naturally called the Pavlov Principle (PP), arose only recently, as a result of the victorious procession of the family of computer training algorithms such as Deep Learning, which led to extremely efficient schemes for using "fine-grained" computing devices (GPU, etc.) solving cognitively complex problems. The article briefly outlines the line of development of ideas about the work of the nervous system, starting with the discovery by I.P. Pavlov of systemic conditioned reflexes, then through the neural and synaptic schemes of E. Konorsky and D. Hebb, the perceptron of F. Rosenblatt, the connectionist works of the 1980s, to modern schemes of deep learning. For the proper functioning of PP based neural networks essential is (initial) randomness of the interneuronal connections.

AB  - In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.

AB  - We live in a complex world where uncertainty is the only certainty. Today's compelling business problem is replaced tomorrow with a problem which was not even imagined yesterday. Data driven decision systems are used by managers in support of their strategic decisions and should be agile and flexibility to survive in our ever change world of complex decisions. The argument presented in this conceptual paper is that data vault modeling is inherently better equipped than dimensional modelling to handle the turbulations of our complex world. The paper investigates the underlying assumptions of dimensional modelling and data vault modelling in terms of requirements collection and the resulting data modelling techniques. It uses critical systems thinking as guiding philosophy to reflect on the benefits of understanding and modelling a variety of perspectives in a problem situation. Critical systems thinking also promotes equal opportunity and accountability. It is argued that both these aspirations can better be achieved by using dimensional modeling as alternative to dimensional modelling. We hope to promote the development of sustainable data driven decision systems which can stand the test of our turbulent times.

AB  - The processing of dynamical systems from everyday life requires the development of system thinking and the record of mathematical relations between variables, which is known as mathematical modelling. The dilemma that appears is how to develop the system thinking and particularly mathematical modelling in schools at earlier ages. In order to discuss dynamical systems, the basic knowledge of differential equations is necessary. Therefore, mathematical modelling appears to be applicable only to students. The article represents a possible processing of dynamical systems with graphic oriented computer programmes, e.g. Berkeley Madonna, Daynasys and Stella in primary schools. The programme packages enable the pupils to construct a given system by linking together different graphical objects for parameters, variables, and fluxes of variables. Some actual examples (liquid flow) of the dynamical systems which can be used in primary schools will be shown in the article. In advance the examples of the liquid flows are linked to simple mathematical models which illustrate the object movement influenced by forces. We lay a particular emphasis on a simple mathematical model for free-falling objects in the air since this topic has already been taught at physics in primary schools.

AB  - The importance of dialogue in questioning assumptions and bringing new options and perspectives to light is well established in various areas of decision-making; what potential does it hold to enrich students' critical thinking competencies in the context of ethics education? We examine student work in an ethics course for senior computer science and software engineering students. The course includes a series of exercises in critical ethical inquiry, implementing the iterative Ethical Cycle approach of van de Poel and Royakkers with reflection sessions where students exchange peer critiques. Through a qualitative analysis of two years of student work, we explore two questions: what kinds of critical issues do students acknowledge in peer dialogue, and how do students incorporate, or fail to incorporate, critical challenges into their work? We identify and categorize critical challenges that appear in student reflection statements, and we identify a number of patterns of critical engagement: ways in which student map the identifications of critical challenges to subsequent changes in later iterations. Our results indicate that dialogue with others is generally an enriching component of students' ethical inquiry, though not all students take advantage of it even when built into class exercises, and other students may adopt new ideas in a superficial way, failing to truly incorporate them into prior discussion. The results also suggest certain design changes of the ethical analysis exercises that can help students take greater advantage of insights from their peers: fostering greater interplay between peers through a single clearly identified topic; more defined scaffolding of peer discussions, prompting students to identify critical challenges from others; further scaffolding to remind students of the peer challenges raised earlier and ask them how (and whether) they wish to incorporate these new perspectives into their own work; and more discussion and modeling of how to truly incorporate new ideas in a robust way.

AB  - Nowadays employees are compelled in their workplaces to use different types of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). ICTs are frequently updated in routine work without necessarily having the means to use them effectively. This inefficiency often causes stress for both ICTs employees and users. This type of stress is generally known as Technostress and it is dealt with by professionals using strategies known under the name of Coping Strategies (CSs). When thinking about information systems we generally forget that people (ICTs users in our case) are one of its important components, which keep information systems' workflow properly working. Based on some anterior researches, this paper proposes a conceptual model to reduce Technostress starting from the triggering agents and ending with the removal or the reduction of Technostress. We conclude by obtaining the Job Satisfaction.

AB  - Six Sigma is an up and coming, new way of thinking that strives for as close to perfection as possible. A Six Sigma approach can be applied to numerous aspects of life from computer science to businesses, and in this paper, we will explore how implementing a Six Sigma approach to a business can affect it. One of the first things we will investigate is how Six Sigma in business varies from how it is used in other fields. Once we understand this, we can dive into the various niches that it can apply to businesses. Some of these things are how it will help reduce waste and increase profits for a business. Expanding on this, we will also consider how implementing a new business practice such as a Six Sigma model could affect employee morale. We anticipate that due to a better business environment that something like this could improve, however it will be expanded upon further later in this research paper. Additionally, the last thing we would like to investigate involving Six Sigma in business is how it can change the quality of that business's goods or services. In this paper we will continue to investigate and research the previously stated research topics regarding Six Sigma in business. We will find out whether it is an effective approach and will be using how it affects waste, productivity, morale, and quality, to make an assessment.

AB  - Educational institutions worldwide continue to improve their teaching and learning activities in almost all the facets of the profession. Upon the declaration of COVID 19 as a pandemic, learning activities were abruptly shifted from the in-person to virtual classroom activities. The transition required changes in the strategies and methods/styles of teaching. Despite the success in most of the activities, classroom interactions and assessments of students' work emerged as areas that deserve more attention. The objective of this study is to develop a pilot project aimed at maintaining acceptable and secured levels of interactions and assessments. The setting for this study includes virtual classroom interactions, peer level tutoring sessions, and formative assessments. To improve the interactions, efficacious assessment methods deploying incremental levels of thinking were used. This requires a third-party program for embedding questions on prerecorded lectures. The questions were then randomized and assigned to the subjects. The use of hierarchical randomization of multiple-choice questions for the short quizzes resulted in reduction of cheating. The performance of the students in the four sections of a calculus course used for this project improved by 17%. For complete eradication of cheating, the midterm was returned from online back to the traditional classrooms. Such move will include the final exam in mid-December.

Communication has an important place in education. The presented analysis is dedicated to Forum activity, with links to other learning activities for support communication (Database, Survey, or Wiki) from Moodle platform. The Forum activity is difficult for creation. Teacher must use on-line help or a specialist on the Moodle for optimal Forum creation via eighteen items. Other analyzed activities need smaller volume of work, but prompt implementation requires simplification using ideas of computational intelligence, and e-learning for knowledge society.

AB  - Distributed computing is becoming a prime need of the current era. The users are demanding more from the existing computing systems in terms of the computational power. The inherent nature of distributed computing enables the distribution of computationally expensive work across various available resources. Due to the distribution of the resources across multiple locations, there exists the challenge of discovering, synthesizing, and facilitating the resources to the client requests. In addition, the discovered resources must also comply with user requests to the diversely available resources along with their current information. In this paper, we aim to explore the resource discovery domain in the area of distributed computing and study the recent proposed schemes. We provide a survey of the distributed networking architecture and inherent discovery techniques. Furthermore, a critical analysis and comparison of the studied approaches is provided considering their networking architecture and the discovery technique.

AB  - The growing concern about offshore chip manufacturing has created considerable interest in solutions that can ensure the integrity and security of chips. Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245× higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.

AB  - Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.

AB  - Imagination is the fundamental of creating something new. Humans can invent things if they can imagine that. So human imagination is the base of all evolution including science and technology. Humans produce their imagination from what they think, hear and see. Artificial imagination is the imagination of a machine which is produced by training a lot of data. Unsupervised learning technique gives the opportunity of learning from data by producing different patterns. It is also a concern of increasing realistic imagination in terms of implementation of artificial imagination like human imagination. This paper aims to review the relationship between artificial imagination and human imagination alongside the overview of implementing artificial imagination using modern machine learning algorithms. We tried to overview all the aspects of human imagination and reviewed their implementation. We also consider the drawbacks of combining human imagination with artificial imagination in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

AB  - In order to enable students to obtain more effective and reliable modeling scheme in the stage of product modeling deliberation, a set of product modeling design program suitable for classroom teaching is constructed based on the method of finite structure analysis (FSM). Firstly, the product main function system is decomposed into several secondary functions by the method of limited structure analysis, and the secondary functions are re-structured and the spatial layout is changed to deduce a variety of modeling schemes. Then, combining with clay model making method, the details of the obtained scheme are deliberated, and then the most reliable design scheme is obtained through comprehensive and objective evaluation and screening by PUGH decision matrix method. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the above methods are verified by the example of the vaneless fan modelling research, which provides support for students to use rational thinking in product modelling design.

In order to expand the thinking of students in the external cultivation class and improve their ability to analyze and solve complex mechanical problems, the research team supplemented the finite element theory for the students in their spare time and introduced the working principle of ABAQUS software. Aiming at the problem of stress and deformation of special-shaped parts proposed by students, the finite element model was established and simulation calculation was carried out by a computer. The simulation results intuitively and clearly show the stress and strain of special-shaped parts, and solve the students’ doubts. The teaching feedback results show that the expansion of finite element theory based on mechanical analysis and the application of ABAQUS software have played an important role in the following three aspects: 1) expanding students’ vision (100%); 2) improving students’ interest in learning (100%); 3) improving the relationship between teachers and students (90.9%).

Our research question asked whether low-cost technology could be effective for making simulated wind, and how it could affect the racing game's usability. Two computer fans were operated by a microcontroller that was connected to a PC running a racing video game. The fans' speed changed according to the car acceleration in the game. We conducted a Concurrent Think Aloud Protocol usability test, where 16 participants played the video game. At the end of the usability test, participants filled out a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. Results indicate that all the participants felt the simulated wind usable for the game. Results also indicated that the game usability was not affected by the simulated wind, and the software/hardware configuration can be a cost-effective solution for simulating wind. Further work include experimenting with more powerful fans.

On this basis, we perform reasonable instructional design and good application of "flipped classroom" in medical experimental teaching. These efforts adapt the learning requirements of students at different levels, and can enhance students' self-learning ability. These efforts can also train students' creative and independent thinking ability, achieve personalized learning, and improve the quality of medical students' experimental teaching. Construction of medical virtual simulation platform in the school of medicine not only provides a new method for basic medical experimental teaching to enable introduction of "flipped classroom" into basic medical experimental teaching, but also promotes implementation of information education and improves the teaching quality of professional disciplines.

AB  - In the present study we call attention to the close connection between languages and globalization and we emphasize the importance of the Internet and online websites in foreign language teaching and learning as unavoidable elements of computer assisted language learning (CALL). Most of the educators can notice the traditional teacher-centered teaching model has been unable to cater for the present situation of College English teaching and learning. The arrival and the development of computers and the Internet offer a turning point in English learning methodology. Promoting student's autonomy in English learning has become an urgent task. What EFL teachers in China need to do now is to modernize English teaching and combine the new with the old so as to adapt the communicative approach to traditional teaching structures. The level-based college English teaching model combined with information technology can not only facilitate the cultivation of professional teachers with teaching proficiency and researching potential but also develop students' creative thinking, promote the students' cross-cultural awareness and strengthen the emotional communication as well. Teachers can utilize the network resources to provide students with a rich visual learning reference, which caters for classroom teaching, students' self-learning and improves teaching efficiency. College English teaching practice needs continued exploration and innovation, the accumulation of teaching experience to receive the best teaching results. However, the effects of such teaching model still depend on program design, classroom management and adequate support from administrators, technicians, teachers and learners themselves.

AB  - According to Aebli's operative method (1963) and Bruner's (1974) theory of representation the development of the process of thinking in teaching has the following phases - levels of abstraction: manipulation with specific things (specific phase), iconic representation (figural phase), symbolic representation (symbolic phase). Modern information technology has contributed to the enrichment of teaching and learning processes, especially in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics and those of production and technology. Simulation appears as a new possibility in the representation of knowledge. According to Guetzkow (1972) simulation is an operative representation of reality from a relevant aspect. It is about a model of an objective system, which is dynamic in itself. If that model is material it is a simple simulation, if it is abstract it is a reflective experiment, that is a computer simulation. This present work deals with the systematization and classification of simulation methods in the teaching of natural sciences and mathematics and of production and technology with special retrospective view on computer simulations and exemplar representation of the place and the role of this modern method of cognition.

AB  - This Work-In-Progress paper in the Innovative Practice Category presents an innovative model of inter-class peer collaboration that enhances student learning in computing education, and addresses student conceptual gaps. It expands the scope of traditional peer learning beyond the usual classroom setting and motivates student creativity leading to interests in co-curricular professional development. This nifty peer learning model connects computing students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class, so that they can aid each other in a mentor-mentee relationship to address conceptual learning gaps. Existing literature on computing educational research show that several peer learning models have been used in a typical classroom setting for reinforcing learning. However, very few peer learning models have been used in an inter-class setting, and none have been driven by student conceptual gaps in order to create an enhanced learning environment. Our model focuses on developing student interests in further co-curricular professional development opportunities in the form of peer mentoring, tutoring and instruction. Currently, student retention is a significant challenge for computing educators, given the demand of the computing disciplines for an all-round solid knowledge base, including grasping of complex technical concepts. Our approach of inter-class peer collaboration strengthens the learning environment of both lower level and upper level computing courses, and provides much needed support to students, whose knowledge base is still underdeveloped and conceptual understanding is undercooked. This unique form of inter-class peer learning provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps by mentoring lower level students. It also enables the lower level students to receive peer guidance for addressing their conceptual gaps. Our improvised peer networking model adds a different dimension to the practice of intra-class peer learning and extends peer learning beyond the traditional bounds. It promotes a new kind of service learning project in classes by encouraging peer mentoring that leads to peer connections across classes. It aids student retention by helping lower level student mentees get over their knowledge limitations. Our work-in-progress research case study indicates that this model inspires peer mentors to engage in out-of-box thinking by challenging them to find creative ways for overcoming conceptual shortcomings of mentees. This, in turn, generates student interests in enhanced co-curricular professional development. Additionally, our ongoing experimental study results show that this model can help in producing a sustainable pool of peer mentors, tutors and teaching assistants, who can become resources plus role-models for other students, and for helping student retention. As part of our in-progress experiments, this model has been deployed within our computer programming classes, where CS2 students have been paired with CS1 students based upon conceptual gaps and knowledge shortcomings. As we conduct these teaching experiments, we analyze the performance of our model through data obtained by conducting student surveys. We discuss these initial collected data and cite them as preliminary evidence in the process of evaluating our model in terms of the improved learning, and generated student interests plus engagement in professional development.

AB  - For early STEM education in elementary and junior high schools, this paper proposes an effective two-sided teaching method based on software virtual simulation and real experiments, using free 3DCG (Three-Dimensional Computer Graphics) modeling design software such as “Blender”, and 3D printer that manufactures the objects designed by Blender. We consider that Blender is useful not only as a virtual simulator and visualization tool, but also a modeling design tool of object that we need in real experimentation. This paper also presents two examples of simulations by Blender for physics and computer algorithm education, in which one simulates for the movement of a horizontally thrown ball and another for well-known “Tower of Hanoi”. The programming of “Tower of Hanoi” requires the understanding of recursive procedure that is important mathematical thinking in programming. We consider that the utilization of Blender will be promising for the proposed two-sided method of STEM education.

AB  - In traditional teaching models, the role of teachers is relatively singular. Teachers are the controllers of the classroom, and students spend less than 10% of their time speaking English besides being asked to answer questions. Therefore, it is difficult for teachers to become promoters, facilitators, or coordinators of students' learning. Therefore, this article conducts research on the intelligent new mode design through the organic integration of computer networks and EL T (English Language Teaching) courses. When designing teaching activities, we should pursue the mutual promotion between the application of information technology and the transformation of teaching methods. Through the comprehensive application of information technology and various activity methods, information technology can not only support existing teaching methods, but also promote the transformation of teaching methods. Through the analysis of the research results indicating the weekly learning volume of EL T courses, it can be found that only a few students consider it easy, while the majority of students believe that the course volume is large, with an average proportion of up to 52.11 %. It can be seen that students can only engage in effective communication between students and teachers on the basis of self-learning and understanding, and their creative thinking can be effectively improved during the learning process.

AB  - Average students are satisfied with the learning obtained through the activities indicated in the course program. It is necessary to innovate in the educational process so that students find more meaning in their learning process, incorporating the experience of similar situations in the workplace, motivating a constant improvement and stimulating the development of creative thinking for the solution of problems.Research suggests that when teachers challenge students with problems according to reality, it increases confidence and motivation for learning in them.In the present work, we share the experience of incorporating a “challenge” in the Analysis and Design of Algorithms course, where through the simulation of a job interview of a software development company, students are motivated to work “an extra time”.

AB  - Modeling of a phenomenon plays a key role in scientific thinking, and therefore an important issue in teaching science. Formulation of a model depends on methods to manipulate it. So far, differential equations have played a major role in scientific modeling because of model analysis using mathematics. However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.
