AB  - The concept of byzantine attack comes from byzantine generals problem. In this abstract concept, the loyal byzantine army general are suppose to coordinate in a battlefield to conclude a common plan in the presence of traitor generals which can disrupt such coordination. This generals problem resembles the attacks initiated by authenticated nodes/devices in ad hoc network to disrupt the network. Although these attacks can be initiated individually but are more devastating if initiate in a combined way. This paper discusses and highlights the performance degradation of AODV routing protocol, mainly when the byzantine attack are initiated in a combination.

AB  - One of the major limitations of current search engines is that users could not quickly locate what they want if the input query is too general. Some existing techniques try to cluster Web search results into groups so as to userpsilas quick browsing. In this paper, we present a new approach to categorize the Web search results by using YAGO ontology. It utilizes the YAGO ontology to automatically generate categories for the user's specific query and classify the search results into appropriate categories. Our experimental results indicate that our method is feasible and effectiveness.

AB  - Courses to train modeling competence are held in higher educational institutions. These courses focus on the final artifacts submitted by learners for analysis and/or evaluation and do not clarify the intermediate creation process. This study focuses on quality of the final class diagram submitted by learners and trials and errors during the creation process. We tried to verify a hypothesis that learners to create an artifact with good quality make a number of trials and errors during the editing process. We collected the fine-grained data regarding the editing history of class diagrams created by learners by our tool called KIfU. We verified the hypothesis by analyzing the collected data. First, we defined two metrics ("Number of editing" and "Number of movement" of symbols in the artifact) calculated from the data that show the learners' trials and errors. Second, we divided learners into two groups, group that created artifacts with good quality and that with not good quality. Finally, we compared the metrics between the groups. The results show that there are statistically significantly differences of values of both metrics between the groups. We conclude the hypothesis we set is correct from the result.

The paper has considered what makes robotics motivating to students, and it has shown how context, need, and the desire to 'make it work' draw them to that learning so naturally that they hardly notice the intellectual strides they are making. The potential of robotics to educate must best be realized through more formal education. Based on analysis of current courses, combining with the knowledge and experience acquired from real operation, a robotic training program is put forward.

Users can express opinions and record daily life using microblogs. Microblogs that are posted by users indicate their interests to some extent. But it seems very hard to analyze the sentiment hided in Chinese Micro text because of its complexity. This paper proposes a new way to determine the sentiment tendency of Chinese micro text based on the partitioned Sense Group (STDSG). When to judge the sentiment tendency of Micro text, we first partition it into separate sense group, and then determine it's sentiment tendency based on Emotional Dictionary. And We aslo consider various factors which contain negations, degree adverbs and punctuations. The effectiveness of STDSG is strongly supported by the results of our experiments.

AB  - Ontology is the basis component of the Semantic Web. Since constructing ontologies is a time consuming job for domain experts, many researches are conducted on automatic extraction of ontologies from texts. As the development of folksonomy, more and more researchers have realized that folksonomy is a better knowledge source for constructing ontologies than texts. Although some works have already been proposed to extract ontologies from folksonomies, these works have little consideration on what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, and lack an principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human's perspective. According to the study in cognitive psychology, there is a family of concepts named basic level concepts, which are frequently used by people in daily life, and most human knowledge is expressed using basic level concepts. In this paper, inspired by studies in cognitive psychology, we try to extract ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on discovering basic level concepts in folksonomies and using them to construct ontologies.

Initially, an exploratory research design was utilized and then it was descriptive to analyze the collected data. The sample size was 100(valid responses) being the management educator of Meerut city as a sample unit. Table & Descriptive Statistics were used to define the data and ‘Correlation and Multiple Regression Analysis’ were used for calculating the outcomes. Major respondents were young-aged educators that truly believe in a challenging and dynamic MEI as of now. The crisis management ability was the most crucial challenge of MEI. "Industry orientation" and "international perspective" were not significant challenges. The study was highly practical because "MEI" has been undergoing a roundabout transformation in the current digitalized scenario, and there has been a paradigm shift in overall higher education following COVID-19. It was highly important because budding managers and forthcoming business leaders have to perform in a highly dynamic environment, and the paper was original as 100 primary responses of management educators in Meerut City were taken into account for study.

Also, it has stepped into many application-oriented colleges, which differ from common universities in teaching goals and characteristics of students. This paper presents some new teaching methods of Digital Image Processing in an application-oriented college. In classroom presentation, more vivid illustrations and less formula derivations are given. While in laboratory exercises, students are instructed to develop some basic image processing functions commonly used in daily digital lives. This acts as a main clue for the whole course: with the progress of classroom teaching, various image processing features are gradually added to the softwares developed by students themselves. Following these methods, students are stimulated and remarkable teaching results are achieved.

AB  - Packaging currently used in the market often results in a waste of resources and environmental pollution. The implementation of green packaging can reduce pollution, optimize the environment, improve international competitiveness, promote the development of export trade, and is also conducive to the implementation of sustainable development strategies. However, despite the existence and benefits of this concept, China has weak green packaging legislation, a lack of relevant financial and technical expertise, a serious shortage of green packaging and other factors, that are hindering the full implementation of its green packaging strategy. To promote the development of green logistics and the implementation of the green packaging strategy, progress will have to be made both by the government and enterprises. The government should focus on strengthening the legal system, giving policy support and also using tax leverage, whereas enterprises should strengthen green packaging awareness, implement green packaging labels and use green packaging materials.

AB  - Today’s technological developments are also having an impact on education. In higher education, there are more and more innovations in content and methodology, such as educational robots, which can be used not only for teaching programming, but also as teaching assistants and pedagogical assistants. Tutor robots offer new opportunities for curriculum development, motivating students, stimulating interest and developing soft skills, while preparing young people to use the latest technological tools. In our online survey, conducted in summer 2022, we explored the views of educators in 14 countries on the characteristics of robot-supported innovation in higher education. The results of the survey show that educators are open to educational innovations. Educational robots are mainly used for teaching programming. They believe that the use of social robots significantly improves students’ creativity and self-expression. The results of this research have shown that the use of educational social robots is an excellent opportunity for methodological innovation and provides scope for experimental teaching.

AB  - This paper introduces selected latest results of a research in situation based product definition. The current representative method of product definition applies situation based control of product feature parameters. In the presented method, application of situation control was improved by placing it from the product feature level to the product behavior level. Because the feature level situation control is a proven key technology in product lifecycle management systems, the new behavior level product definition process controls the process of the feature level product definition. This paper starts with a comparison of the feature and the behavior level product feature definition. Following this, the product request, product behavior, and context structure feature definitions are introduced as main elements of the behavior level product feature definition process. Next, a new context structure and its connection with the feature sequence is exampled and discussed. Finally, application of the proposed method in product lifecycle management systems is outlined.

AB  - The idea of brain machine interface (BMI) is to provide a source of interaction between a person and a machine via thought. Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in interest and challenges in image processing and pattern recognition, specifically in the context of air writing. This exciting research area has significant potential to advance automation processes and improve human-machine interfaces in various applications. The emergence of faster computers, affordable high-performance video cameras, and the need for automated analysis of videos has led to an increase in the popularity of object tracking, a critical task in computer vision. The process of video analysis typically encompasses object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis. Object tracking involves four main aspects choosing the suitable object representation, selecting features for tracking, detecting the object, and tracking the object. Object tracking algorithms find applications in different domains, including vehicle navigation, video indexing, and surveillance that are automated. The objective of the paper is to create a software application for smart wearable devices that utilizes computer vision to track finger gestures in the air, functioning as a motion-to-text converter for air-writing. The technology will facilitate communication for people by enabling them to generate text for multiple purposes, like sending emails and messages, through intermittent gestures. This is a productive means of communication that curbs the usage of laptops and mobiles, making it particularly beneficial for individuals who are deaf.

AB  - The advancement in technology related to artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot topic of debate in recent years. One concern is the possibility of job loss when machines with algorithms take over tasks that formerly required human labour. It analyses the implications of artificial intelligence technologies on the job market, paying particular attention to how it can decrease the demand for physical labour and perhaps oust employees from their professions. The distribution of wealth, salaries, efficiency, and job abilities are all areas where AI has the capability to have a significant impact. The paper also looks at the ethical implications of AI, such as how it will impact privacy, bias, and decision-making. The study outlines the potential dangers and benefits of AI on work and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders to lessen adverse effects and realize the potential benefits of AI through a thorough analysis of the available literature and case studies. The study concludes that AI can change how work is done and that proactive steps must be taken to solve potential problems and take full advantage of the opportunities that AI presents. Overall, the present study provides an in-depth knowledge of how AI will impact the workplace, placing a strong focus on the potential for job displacement and creation, the impact on salaries and output, and the need for ethical considerations.

AB  - In the course of creating and analyzing music content, artificial intelligence systems are widely used, and according to the forecasts of analysts, their use in the field of music will grow steadily. Modern artificial intelligence systems successfully solve problems that cause difficulties for humans. However, these systems lack the ability to create and evaluate the semantics of musical works the same way as humans do. The problem of creating musical artificial intelligence with the creative abilities of the human mind is one of the most topical and complex problems in the music industry. The solution to this problem in the first place lies in studying and understanding the essence of the term “Musical Sense”. The purpose of the study is to develop a concept for the probabilistic assessment of the musical texts' semantics based on the concepts of information theory and information technologies. To achieve the goal, a convergent approach to the study of the problem of musical meaning, proposed by Professor A. B. Kayak, was used. As a result of the completed study, the main conceptual provisions of the theory of probabilistic evaluation of musical senses have been developed. The article is of a theoretical nature. However, the materials of the article may be of practical interest for researchers of the problem of sense and developers of artificial intelligence in the music industry.

Highly-secured environments like critical infrastructures have to count less significant but more effective risks, which may lead to a fatal effect in the society. More stringent regulations involve more reliable access systems, which use mostly multimodal biometrical identification. Soft-computing techniques, especially fuzzy logic is suitable as a controller algorithm in a multimodal biometrical identification system. To highlight the advantages of this method, I modeled a comparison between the statistical mean value calculation and the fuzzy logic adapted controller.

AB  - Permeability is a crucial factor in oil and gas exploration and development, as it indicates a reservoir's ability to flow. To predict permeability from electrical exploration results, Critical Path Analysis (CPA) is commonly used by combining reservoir permeability and electrical conductivity. However, the accuracy of CPA decreases when unconventional reservoirs exhibit strong anisotropy, such as fractured shales. This study presents tensor-based CPA methods that utilize equivalent electrical parameters and permeability tensor to address this issue. The approach involves obtaining critical pore radius and permeability in tensor form through matrix operation. The accuracy of the CPA formula in calculating reservoir permeability is then compared with numerical simulation results. The findings indicate that the tensor-based CPA method significantly improves the permeability prediction accuracy of anisotropic media, and further improvements can be made using the revised tensor-based CPA.

AB  - Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-end visual tasks that has remained a topic of interest in various domains. Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images. Finally, the problems and challenges to be tackled are concluded which highlight the future direction of analysis.

AB  - social media in Education has worked like a revolution in changing the learning system. Learning according to the convenience such as place and time of the students has pulled more interest to educate more through social media. In this study, we had investigated the perspective of students from different educational levels towards social media learning. A total no. of 130 students participated in our online survey. Convenient sampling was used for the study. According to the results and findings of the study learning through social media has both positive and negative impacts. The majority of respondents spend 1–3 hours a day on average. Additionally, we found that Youtube is the most used application by students for social media learning among Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Whatsapp, and YouTube. Although learning through social media makes a great contribution for learners in their area of interest. However, it has also affected the physical and mental health of the students. Due to social media learning, socialization among people has been reduced.

AB  - In order to avoid the problem of mismatch between questioner and respondent, an impression evaluation experiment was conducted and nine factors were obtained as a result. The factors were then used to estimate the factor scores of all other statements through multiple regression analysis and to select the most appropriate respondents. The factors, however, have been obtained without taking into consideration the categories of the Q&A statements. In this paper we therefore investigated whether the consideration of categories could lead to obtaining more apparent tendencies and precise results to select the most appropriate respondents. In this paper, factor analysis is applied to the experimental results with a consideration of the following categories: Auction, PC, Love, and Politics. As a result of factor analysis, both similarity and difference could be observed for each category of Q&A statements. Comparing the new results with the previous one, two similar main factors could be obtained regardless of the category considered. On the other hand, factors other than the two have were also obtained for each respective category. This shows that the number of factors obtained for each category varies.

The bottom-up approach has been proved as more effective in process improvement applied to technical and scientific environments, in oppocition to standard improvement models such as ISO or CMMI. However, when bottom-up is applied to elicit improvement areas, the method is usually limited to the use of surveys that miss many of the root causes and structural deficiencies. To complement the elicitation process, we propose the use of requirement-gathering techniques such as Card Sorting, Kelly Grid and Multi-Voting. Initial results are discussed in this paper.

AB  - The article refers to interdisciplinary scientific research in philosophy, information theory and the theory of algorithms. This article presents the results of theoretical studies on the formalization of human intellectual activity in relation to the field of cognitive sciences. The subject of the study is the concept of sense. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of historical exploration, gamification, and immersive technologies to enhance engagement and learning in history education. Traditional methods of historical inquiry often struggle to captivate learners' interest, particularly in an era dominated by digital experiences. Gamification, incorporating game elements into non-game contexts, has shown promise in fostering engagement and motivation. This study delves into the potential benefits of leveraging immersive gamification to create dynamic and captivating historical exploration experiences. The theoretical framework draws upon educational theories, game design principles, and the evolving landscape of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. We examine the limitations of traditional historical education methods and discuss how gamification can address these challenges by providing interactive and participatory learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper outlines fundamental design principles for creating immersive historical exploration scenarios, emphasising the importance of narrative structure, game mechanics, and user engagement. Through case studies, we highlight successful applications of immersive gamification in historical education, presenting outcomes and insights gained from these implementations. Challenges and considerations in integrating immersive gamification into historical exploration are also explored, including ethical considerations and accessibility issues. The paper concludes by proposing future directions for research in this emerging field, anticipating the continued evolution of technologies and pedagogical approaches.

AB  - Affective interaction with virtual humans can enhance the quality of user experience in virtual reality. It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.

AB  - The human nervous system is the controlling mechanism for coordinating all body-related activities. In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.

AB  - Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field, but more collaboration among STEM disciplines is needed to advance undergraduate neuroscience education. This paper reports the development of code-based virtual laboratories to cross-foster ideas from engineering and biology in the neuroscience classroom. The simulations use a combination of NEURON and Python code to model neurophysiological processes. We report that the use of computational tools in the classroom increases student self-reported comfort in participating in a computational research project. The tools we developed have potential to increase persistence and retention of undergraduate students by encouraging interdisciplinary thinking and reducing barriers to entry.

AB  - The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.

AB  - Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.

AB  - Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.

AB  - As one of the most striking research hotspots in both academia and industry, Internet of Things (IoT) has been constantly changing our daily life by joining together nearly all we can imagine. From home furnishings and vehicles to urban facilities, all these smart things need powerful managing and processing capabilities to deal with mass multimedia data in different content forms such as images, audios, and videos. Nowadays, since Moore's Law is no longer applicable, conventional thinking may not be adequate in facing the explosive growing amount of data. Hence, in this paper, we adopt the idea of in-memory processing to solve the problem of real-time multimedia big data computing in IoT. We apply closed-loop feedback in the scheduling method design to integrate in-memory storages of all devices within a 3-tier network structure. In addition, we consider the respective conditions of different real-time required levels and content forms. The analysis results show that our scheduling method can achieve better workload allocation with less latency in comparison of existing methods.

AB  - When the new generation of designers face more complex design issues, the form of design starts to shift, with the user centered concept continuously being accentuated and applied for problem-solving. The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users. It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.

AB  - What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.

AB  - Women are underrepresented in the field of Computer Science. This project aims to help Secondary School girls develop an insight into the role computers play in society and to learn some of the key skills in computing including computer programming. Exposure to Computer Science, in home or school environments, and encouragement from family and peers are leading factors that influence girls' decisions to pursue careers in Computer Science. Other factors include the girls' perception of their own problem solving ability, an understanding of the diverse applications of Computer Science and related career paths and the potential for positive social impact. This paper describes the design of an after school computing programme, CodePlus, which uses a novel 21st Century learning model. Pre and post questionnaire are being used to explore girls intentions to study CS, their confidence to study CS, perception of CS as a career, gender perception of CS and IT profession and self-efficacy following participation in the CodePlus programme. Preliminary results comparing pre questionnaire results with a male control group highlight differences in how girls see themselves in terms of CS capabilities and their future potential. Initial post questionnaire findings show a significant increase in the participants' perceived programming ability.

AB  - The impact of technology on workforce development and socioeconomic prosperity has made K-12 computing engineering and STEM in general a national educational priority. However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.

AB  - As part of the 3D printing summer course for undergrads in our university, students were introduced to Autodesk Tinkercad as a design tool for creating and editing 3D models. After a brief period of familiarization with Tinkercad, we presented students with Codeblocks, a tool integrated with Tinkercad that enables the creation of 3D models through programming under the blocks model. To our surprise, students started creating complex and lengthy programs to produce original printable 3D objects. We decided to investigate this level of engagement using a questionnaire to collect opinions and experiences from students and a set of metrics to categorize their programming work. The results obtained are presented in this paper along with our conjectures on the causes of the enthusiasm observed with Codeblocks. Three factors seem to have been key in this case: diversity in the composition of the student group, availability of 3D printers to materialize designs, and a relaxed environment where test and failure were common and acceptable.

In this sense, research studies that analyse the causes of the reduction of students who are interested in computer science mainly point to young people being unaware of the type of tasks computer scientists perform. Therefore, in order to try to reverse this trend many types of initiatives have been organized seeking to bring the world of computing to children and adolescents.

AB  - Problem solving, analyzing the validity of a solution and spotting patterns in data are all substantial skills needed in the workplace nowadays not only in the programming field. Solving and generating multiple solutions to a problem is quite challenging for children with autism spectrum disorders. As a solution, the work in this paper presents the design, implementation and the evaluation of a serious game that focuses on the sequential programming concepts. The presented game aims to teach problem solving skills to children with autism. A user-study was conducted to evaluate the game with children who have autism. According to the evaluation carried out in this research, the game was proven to be engaging, which indicates that the serious game is promising for teaching sequential programming concepts to children with autism.

AB  - We have administered the extended attitude test of the Testing Algorithmic and Application Skills project (TAaAS) to reveal the computer problem solving approaches of first year students of informatics, their expectations considering tertiary studies, and their relationship with computer sciences/ informatics. The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills.

AB  - In this paper we present CodeCraft, an educational video game we are developing to teach the fundamentals of computer programming. Similar to other educational tools such as Scratch, Alice, Project Spark, and Code Spells; CodeCraft provides users with an intuitive graphical interface for writing programs. However, CodeCraft is a video game that uses a problem-based learning approach in which players learn programming concepts by solving individual puzzles in an immersive 3D environment. Moreover, CodeCraft is intended to be an autonomous learning game that can be played without teacher support, thereby potentially reaching students in all economic, ethnic, and gender groups. Using an iterative development process and evidence-centered design, this work proposes to further develop CodeCraft and evaluate how it can improve performance in acquiring programming skills.

AB  - Programming is a traditional part of informatics education from Primary to Upper Secondary Education in Slovakia. We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of programming skills of first semester undergraduate computer science & engineering students using Rainfall programming problem. 345 students, in a 2 hour laboratory session, solved the Rainfall programming problem using either (block-based) Scratch or (flowchart-based) Flowgorithm tool. The success rate, in terms of the number of correctly implemented sub-goals, of the students has been analyzed. The possible influence of factors such as the non-texual modality tool, gender difference, school board from which students had their higher secondary education and prior computing experience in their higher secondary stage has been presented. The possible factors for difficulty towards conceiving and implementing the sub-goals has been indicated based on the observations while evaluating the student programs.

AB  - Programming for beginners is becoming increasingly more difficult to understand since most innovative tools immediately throw students into an environment where they must build everything in a program from nothing with inconsequential programming skills and little knowledge of programming concepts. As programming based careers are rising in demand, it is important to help the beginner programmers bridge the gap between understanding a program and developing one. Robot Chronicle offers a solution to this dilemma through a different approach than common state machines such as Scratch, Alice, Playmaker, and Code Spells and introduces the basic concepts of programming through a puzzle-based video game.

AB  - Virtual Reality has been one of the interesting topics that have risen in the previous years. It has diverged into many fields including medicine, tourism, and education. On the other hand, new techniques have been used for teaching programming rather than the traditional paper and pen technique. The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032.

AB  - In university computer course, character encoding and its processing involves multiple hardware, and the process is relatively complex and mostly invisible, which makes it difficult for students to understand. In this paper, a virtual experiment is proposed to this process. By using Blockly and other tools, students can independently design character encoding and write Blockly code to describe the whole process of character processing. Relying on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology, the whole process of character processing can be visually demonstrated. It enables students to deeply understand the functions of various character encodings and deepens the understanding of binary coding methods.

AB  - Until relatively recently, technology has been used as a passive tool that makes the learner a user of various applications. However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out. The results obtained indicate that they have been able to master the new vocabulary, assimilate the concepts and work for themselves with the chosen tool to carry out the intervention.

AB  - The global video game industry's revenues reached 7.2 billion in 2007 and over $65 billion in 2012 with projected growth over $80 billion by 2017. As new consoles, PC, and mobile devices penetrate more foreign markets, revenues derived from these devices and software will continue to increase. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design. This degree will give students the skills needed to pursue a career within the game industry and others while developing engineering skills.

AB  - Problems involving human activity systems contain a soft element which makes them hard to resolve using traditional approaches. Teaching programming is no difference in this regard. The presence of numerous factors makes it a complex and messy situation. However, one key contributor to this problem is the differences in perception of the parties involved. This paper aims to analyze the problem of teaching programming within a computer science department at Omar Elmukhtar University (OMU) through the application of soft system methodology SSM, in addition to investigating the effects and benefits of using such an approach in order to suggest a solution. Through constructing a root definition and conceptual model, we were able to provide a standard to which the current organization can be compared against, and therefore, achieve a better understanding regarding which changes need to be carried out in order to attain the system's desired results.

This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong.

AB  - Mobile programming is one of the fastest growing approaches in many fields, such as marketing or e-commerce. From the educational perspective, this means that students should understand that they can build mobile applications (apps) without being professionals, and at the same time recognize their own potential to use technology in any professional path they choose. This goal is not trivial, even if students are in general curious and open to learn about the creation of apps. Indeed, especially in liberal education, students get discouraged upfront as they perceive programming as a difficult task. This paper describes a course that was cre- ated to fit the educational needs of a social-economic high school. Students take part of an interdisciplinary project in which the Software Engineering process is used to promote CT skills. The course was repeated twice and involved 29 students (8th and 9th grade).

AB  - Studies indicate that students, particularly females, find computing most engaging when it is presented in relation to real-life problems, rather than when it is presented in ways that emphasize computing for the sake of computing. Video scenarios are a novel tool for encouraging students to explore computing in a problem-centric, rather than a code-centric, manner. Video scenarios are short films (2-5 minutes long) that depict individuals facing problems in life-like settings. The scenarios emphasize the diverse and often ill-defined nature of real world problems, and the potential for creative and entrepreneurial computing they present. The video scenarios and their associated discussion/exercise questions are freely available on the web at www.Virt-U.org.

AB  - Several reasons have led to the widespread adoption of neural-based algorithms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), including their high performance, elegant model designs, and parallel computing capabilities. Numerous ASR models have been proposed to improve the recognition results, but the gains are still insufficient. This paper proposes a re-thinking ASR model, which aims to bridge the gap by rethinking the regularities of a given hypothesis and the relationship between text-level and acoustic-level characteristics of the input speech utterance. For the re-thinking ASR model, a mixed attention mechanism, a self-and-mixed attention mechanism, and a deep acoustic feature extractor are meticulously designed to enable the notion to be realized. A publicly available benchmark corpus is used to evaluate the proposed model. As the experimental results demonstrate, the proposed re-thinking ASR model can provide significant and consistent improvements over popular baseline systems.

AB  - The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification.

AB  - Design of new strategies according to game models has been a general approach from the start. There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.

AB  - This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).

AB  - The “Scratch4All” project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.

The camp was proposed to keep boys ages 12-15 living in a community with high levels of gang enrollment off the streets while providing an opportunity to learn about college and computing careers. The police also wanted to improve officer-youth r elations. Our lab provided camp counselors, space, and content for the camp. Each camp supported a total of twelve African-American boys. Over three years, we refactored the curricula and organization of the camp and present our lessons learned from the experience.

AB  - This practice work-in-progress paper describes an innovative laboratory course designed to introduce a heterogenous cohort of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering and science to the principles of designing and analyzing complex electronic systems. The course utilizes a self-developed drum machine as a visual and acoustic project with a gradually increasing level of complexity throughout the lab sessions. Through active participation students acquire an understanding of SPICE simulations, test & measurement equipment, and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The course is mandatory for students pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical, mechatronic, biomedical, computational, and information system engineering, and is also attended as an optional module by computer science and physics students. In the winter term of 2022, the course returned to the lab after the COVID-19 pandemic and was attended by more than 200 students. The laboratory experiments are supported by complementary activities, such as SPICE simulations of the circuits as preparation, and lab reports written in LaTeX to introduce the students to scientific writing. Instructional videos and consultation hours are offered to assist with SPICE simulation and LaTeX. During the physical lab sessions, students work in groups of three in a traditional laboratory environment, with student tutors available to provide guidance offered in the form of minimal help. Overall, the presented lab course is an innovative and engaging method of teaching electronic systems. The self-developed drum machine provides a visually and audibly stimulating project, allowing students to learn practical skills and develop their theoretical knowledge.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that many freshmen go to university without any prior grounding in computer science. Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications. The paper outlines the course and its content in detail, as well as providing quantitative and qualitative evidence of its benefit and appeal to female students.

On one hand, it presents the technical aspects of the environment and, on the other hand, based on an experimental study done, it identifies students' behavior and attitudes when playing on their own initiative. We want to verify the relations between students' performance and their engagement, satisfaction, and problem-solving strategies. The understanding of these relations may help to identify students' characteristics that may point out to the teacher the need for individualized support.

AB  - In this study we assess the effects of teaching fundamental programming concepts through a virtual reality (VR) block-based programming application and its impact on engagement. As a comparison study, participants played an existing desktop-based game (LightBot) and the developed VR game (LogiBot) covering similar gameplay mechanics and block-based programming. Initial results indicate that traditional desktop applications are currently more engaging than VR for teaching programming. We thus identify the need for careful design of interaction methods to support ease of use and reward factors to promote engagement in VR-based learning applications beyond the initial wow-factor.

AB  - Our contemporary society necessitates professionals equipped with 21st-century skills. Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.

AB  - The theme “personal data” is on the rise due to entry into force of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), also known as law no. 13.709/2018, and deals with any relationship between the treatment of information classified as personal data by any means. This article aims to present the main concepts involving data privacy, the fundamentals of the LGPD and the tools and methods to assist in the implementation of the law. To verify the adequacy of organizations to LGPD in Brazil, a survey was carried out through a survey with 216 professionals from different market segments and regions. After the analysis of the survey results, it became clear that many companies are starting projects to adapt to the LGPD and that the internal structures are still small and deserve extra attention in the training of employees

AB  - Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as "processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.
