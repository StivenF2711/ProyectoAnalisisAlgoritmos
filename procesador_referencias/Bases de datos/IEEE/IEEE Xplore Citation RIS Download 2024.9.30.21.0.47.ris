AB  - Software engineering for mobile applications has its own challenges, different from when we engineer software just for desktop environments. With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey’s questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.

AB  - Bryan Johnson is on a quest for zeros. The enigmatic founder of Braintree, former CEO of Venmo, and founder of Kernel, which develops brain measurement and imaging systems, Johnson has made it his mission to discover the kinds of once-in-a-generation factors that radically alter the way we understand the world. He seeks &#x0022;zeros&#x0022;&#x2014;the discovery of fundamental building blocks, tenets, or rules that previously seemed impossible or beyond our vision.<superscript>1</superscript> They&#x0027;re the discovery of something that didn&#x0027;t exist in our limited minds, lingering in an alternate dimension until finally pulled out of the ether and into our field of perception. Albert Einstein&#x0027;s theory of relativity, for instance, set scientists on a new path of stunning breakthroughs in quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and cosmology, but none of those subsequent discoveries opened up the same step-change in scientific thinking as E=3Dmc<superscript>2</superscript>. As these types of life-altering building blocks get defined, new ways of thinking emerge. In the cognitive economy, powerful forms of computational intelligence will accelerate them. For example, the AlphaGo system&#x0027;s radically unexpected moves in its victories over Go world champion Lee Sedol hinted at how deep learning systems could offer other step-change departures from the forces, logic, and patterns we take as gospel.

AB  - Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used to deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Compared with fuzzy linguistic approaches, they are more convenient and flexible to reflect the DMs' preferences in decision making. For further applications of HFLTSs to decision making, we develop a concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) as a tool to collect and present the DMs' preferences. Due to the importance of the consistency measures using preference relations in decision making, we develop some consistency measures for HFLPRs to ensure that the DMs are being neither random nor illogical. A consistency index is defined to establish the consistency thresholds of HFLPRs to measure whether an HFLPR is of acceptable consistency. For HFLPRs with unacceptable consistency, we develop two optimization methods to improve the consistency until they are acceptable. Several illustrative examples are given to validate the consistency measures and the optimization methods.

AB  - In the present analytic thinking, we have modeled the governing equations of a two dimensional peristaltic transport of a Hyperbolic tangent nanofluid in the presence of a heat source/sink with the combined effects of thermal radiation and inclined magnetic field in a tapered asymmetric channel. The propagation of waves on the non-uniform walls to have different amplitudes and phase but the same wave speed is produced the tapered asymmetric channel. The equations of dimensionless temperature and nanoparticle concentration are solved analytically under assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The governing equations of momentum of a hyperbolic tangent nanofluid for the tapered asymmetric channel have also been solved analytically using the regular perturbation method. The expression for average rise in pressure has been figured using numerical integrations. The effects of various physical parameters entering into the problem are discussed numerically and graphically. The phenomenon of trapping is also investigated. Furthermore, the received results show that the maximum pressure rise gets increased in case of non-Newtonian fluid when equated with Newtonian fluid.

AB  - The three-way decision theory provides a three-way philosophical thinking to solve problems, and the regret theory quantifies the risk preferences of decision makers under different psychological behaviors. On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.

AB  - Fuzzy set theory has been widely and successfully used as a mathematical tool to combine the outputs provided by the individual classifiers in a multiclassification system by means of a fuzzy aggregation operator. However, to the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy combination method has been proposed, which is composed of a fuzzy rule-based system. We think this can be a very promising research line as it allows us to benefit from the key advantage of fuzzy systems, i.e., their interpretability. By using a fuzzy linguistic rule-based classification system as a combination method, the resulting classifier ensemble would show a hierarchical structure, and the operation of the latter component would be transparent to the user. Moreover, for the specific case of fuzzy multiclassification systems, the new approach could also become a smart way to allow standard fuzzy classifiers to deal with high-dimensional problems, avoiding the curse of dimensionality, as the chance to perform classifier selection at class level is also incorporated, into the method. We conduct comprehensive experiments considering 20 UCI datasets with different dimensionality, where our approach improves or at least maintains accuracy, while reducing complexity of the system, and provides some interpretability insight into the multiclassification system reasoning mechanism. The results obtained show that this approach is able to compete with the state-of-the-art multiclassification system selection and fusion methods in terms of accuracy, thus providing a good interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.

AB  - The law of total probability plays an essential role in Bayesian reasoning, which has been used in many fields. However, some experiments show the law of total probability can be violated. In recent years, researchers have tried to explain this paradox with the interference effect in quantum theory, and they think the main reason for interference effects is the uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to effectively model and process the uncertain information in the decision-making process is very important to understand and predict the interference effects. Zadeh proposed the fuzzy set by considering the fuzziness of information. Later, Atanassov proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). IFS better describes the fuzzy information from the view of membership, nonmembership than fuzzy sets, which can also more flexibly simulate human decision making. Hence, the article proposed the fuzzy Markov decision-making model (FDM) under the framework of IFS to explain and predict the interference effects of decision-making process. In FDM, intuitionistic fuzzy number can be generated by using the negation operation of probability. In addition, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the Kolmogorov equation, which can consider the evolution time in the decision-making process. The transition matrix establishes the relationship between different stages to get the fuzzy numbers of final states. Finally, the article used the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to transform fuzzy number into the probability. In summary, the proposed FDM can provide a novel idea to explore and explain the interference effects in the decision-making process, which is helpful to promote the development of artificial intelligence.

AB  - The existing fuzzy multiattribute decision making methods rely too much on discrete information fusion operators. In the context of big data, it cannot meet the needs of rapid fusion of massive data, nor can it reflect the continuous change of decision-makers thinking over time. In this article, we study how to integrate large-scare continuous hesitant fuzzy information more efficiently. We define the concepts of continuous hesitant fuzzy sets and continuous hesitant fuzzy functions. Based on these, we further explore definite line integrals of continuous hesitant fuzzy functions and their related properties. Two continuous hesitant fuzzy information integration models based on the hesitant fuzzy calculus are proposed. We also commit to revealing the internal connections between the first line integral model, the second line integral model, and the hesitant fuzzy weighted operator. We state why it is necessary to introduce novel aggregation models based on definite line integrals, and then provide applications of the proposed models to prove their validity and rationality. Finally, we compare the proposed models with other aggregation operators to further demonstrate their effectiveness and rationality.

AB  - Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique for continuously extracting the largest amount of energy that a source can provide under varying conditions, and it is indispensable for modern photovoltaic (PV) panels. Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.

AB  - Social networks are gaining importance as an important application landscape for machine learning techniques. Currently, it is prevalent thinking to introduce social networks into group decision-making research, despite exhibiting promising performance, there remain significant challenges, including 1) trust risk is often overlooked, and 2) group opinions are excessively relied upon. In this regard, this article introduces the trust risk test for group consensus (SN-TRT-GC) by using probabilistic linguistic preference relations under probabilistic linguistic term sets. The proposed method ensures that the expert's competence matches the discourse as much as possible by virtue of the trust risk value. Moreover, opinion evolution relies on the dual attributes of similarity and trust, which promote the exchange of opinions among experts and greatly accelerate the consensus reaching process. Empirical investigations of satisfaction surveys demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented SN-TRT-GC technique.

AB  - In order to meet the challenge of Big Data, enhance the intelligent level of distribution grid, the better for the power user service. Starting from the characteristics of 4 V of Big Data, the 6 links to the power supply system of industrial chain (i.e., planning, design, construction, operation, management & regulation of distribution grids, and equipment design and manufacturing) is relatively mature degree angle; the needs of Big Data's application in distribution network have been analysed. B y using the method o f SWOT, analysed the double-edged sword effect Big Data for the distribution gird, provides both opportunities and challenges. The benefits and opportunities is that, Big Data bringing data view, changing thinking methods and tools, expanding the application scene, providing better service to the society, enhancing the value of the opportunity. At the same time, Big Data will lead to the challenges in distribution grid, for example, because of security challenges of Big Data itself, Big Data more concentrated, cause safety challenges in distribution grid is more serious; the energy consumption challenges of Big Data; Big Data privacy threat distribution grid and user. The demand for Big Data's application in distribution grids in industrial chain is that, from strong to weak, management & regulation of distribution grids, operation, equipment design and manufacturing, construction, design, planning. Big Data's source of power supply enterprise's internal operation, including 3 parts, physical grid operation, marketing services and grid enterprise operation. Power system technology innovation by three wheel drive (experimental science, theoretical science, computational science) increased to four wheel drive (experimental science, theoretical science, computational science, data intensive science/data exploration science) paradigm. Big data is still “explosion”, control the fourth paradigm - data intensive science also need to redouble our efforts. Non structure data in distribution grid will be rapid growth, 50% more than the amount of data in the next five years.

AB  - Normalized cut based image segmentation has a variety of applications in the area of image compression, medical imaging, mapping and measurements. But, the computational complexity of conventional normalized cut algorithm based on generalized eigenvalue problem is high. In this study, we proposed a simplified normalized cut algorithm using graph partitioning method for image segmentation. The computational cost of this simplified method are relatively low and hence, it can be implemented on real time embedded system applications. We have implemented an FPGA based image segmentation system using the simplified normalized cut algorithm and tested it for malarial parasites detection. Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL) is used to develop the system and implemented on FPGA Spartan-6 targeted device xc6slx16- 2csg324. The Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture is used to design the system. We think the proposed architecture can be useful for real time image segmentation.

AB  - An approximate parallel prefix adder is a type of circuit that can perform addition operations on binary numbers with extremely high speed, low latency, and much less power. Nowadays, thinking about fuzzy computing, that is, sacrificing computational expectations for computational efforts, has emerged as a promising graphical approach. Over the past decade, various research works have explored approximate computation at both the software level and the hardware abstraction level, with encouraging results. At the stage of hardware abstraction, adders (which are the most widely used and mandatory information operators in digital systems) have generated great interest in the approximation used in digital systems used in image processing applications. The approximate Brent-Kung adder (AxBK) is a variant of the simple Brent-Kung adder that introduces a degree of approximation into its operation. A new approximate BK adder is proposed with high-speed overall performance and low error cost. Its BK adder and AxBK adder are restricted to bits 8,16,32 using software called Xilinx Vivado and MATLAB.

AB  - Robotics and computational thought are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results. The results of this work show that it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.

AB  - This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.

AB  - Using the Scratch environment as a tool to teach programming skills or develop computational thinking is increasingly common in all levels of education, well-documented case studies from primary school to university can be found. However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices. Along with suggestions for future work, some ideas that might assist to address such situations are proposed in the conclusions of the paper.

AB  - Now-a-days information security over unsecured communication channel is one of the most challenging issues. Cryptography and steganography, a sub-discipline of information hiding, are two distinct popular security offering techniques. To get the combined chemistry from these techniques, today's real-time security systems include both cryptography and steganography in their working principle. To cope up with those systems, we have proposed a format-based pure text steganography algorithm including a private key cryptography providing a higher level of security. The cover text has been made as ordinary as possible. After successful embedding of the secret message into the cover text, the stego-text also looks like an ordinary text because only an alphanumeric puzzle is added at the end of the cover text to make up the stego-text. This final stego-text is sent to the receiver through the unsecured communication channel. Instead of correct recipient, if any third party or cracker or hacker obtains the stego-text, they may think that it is an ordinary text to teach English to the kids since we made it like that or if they try to extract the original message, it requires a huge amount of computational time. The proposed algorithm supersedes various text steganographic techniques through combining both cryptography and steganography.

AB  - The Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego) programming method facilitates the use of different educational tools and environments to provide better understanding of spreadsheet programming while developing computational thinking and algorithmic skills. With virtual reality technologies gaining attention and popularity, our goal was to investigate and create a virtual workspace in which the students can find all the information and resources they need while learning spreadsheet programming, computer problem solving, and understanding, building algorithms. Following on this principle, we developed a 3D virtual collaboration space to provide students with one interface featuring the information and resources required to practice the Sprego method outside of and during classes. We have collected, refined, and structured the available sources and developed detailed tasks with explanations for students in the form of online documents. Our goal was to provide an all-in-one environment for the Sprego method to learn, explore, and practice all its aspects without leaving the 3D space. For our work, we examined different applications that provide virtual 3D spaces with educational support in mind. Our choice was the MaxWhere Seminar system, based on its innovative and effective approach in the field.

AB  - Data entry has been a hectic job since the era of data accumulation started. Apparently, that is why there is a full-fledged career in data entry. Data entry method varies with requirements. Early days of computers relied on punch cards and gradually keyboards and mouse came into picture which we still use. Touchscreens didn't take much time to replace the physical keyboard inputs and now as the result of human intelligence and innovation, the era of the optical input is here. Where the user does not even have to take the pain of thinking about entering data but can simply use an optical reader or scanner to input data. Using the computational power the individual elements like text, images, and special characters can be distinguished. OCR-Optical Character Recognizer does the work. OCR works similar to humans when it comes to character recognition as it maintains a database of characters and compares all the scanned elements with the database which makes it really simple to understand. This paper explains the working of an OCR in its different stages. That study helps in finding the various drawbacks of the conventional system. The paper also tells about how those shortcomings can be eliminated and how a better OCR that is future ready can be achieved.

AB  - Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that makes it easy for children above 10 to use. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.

AB  - ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is an agreement from ASEAN countries to form a free trade area which is used to increase the economic competitiveness in ASEAN regional area. Some governmental agencies and national companies have to prepare to face AFTA and build their strategies to survive from trade area by understanding what Indonesian people think about that. In this paper we present a system to analyze the opinion of Indonesian people about AFTA and extract a useful information of the sentiment analysis from their opinion. Our system consists of 5 computational steps: (1) Data Acquisition, (2) Text Mining, (3) Sentiment Analysis Engine, (4) Temporal Projection Engine, and (5) Context Processing Unit. We apply a new approach to analyze opinions about AFTA by opinion mining based on temporal sentiment analysis. This approach extracts and process textual data automatically to obtain sentiment information in the opinion sentences. The results show effectiveness of the simple approach for gaining the sentiment information from people's opinions and some stakeholders and students who are concerned in AFTA have assessed this solution.

AB  - Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.

AB  - We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.

AB  - For the last three years the CS for All initiative at the National Science Foundation has had a call for research-practice partnership (RPP) projects. The goal of the program is to advance both knowledge and practice in creating inclusive, responsive computer science/computational thinking programs for all K-12 youth. RPPs represent an approach to research that, by design, is both more equitable and more ethical because it leverages community stakeholder experiences and perspectives to inform research questions, methods, and meaning-making. RPPs are thus potentially powerful tools for equity-oriented initiatives such as CS for All. Beginning in December 2016, the Research + Practice Collaboratory, an NSF-funded initiative based at the University of Washington, has led ten RPP development workshops for CS for All, collectively serving over 700 members of the community. At these workshops we have collected data about how the community sees itself benefiting from the adoption of RPP approaches to the work. In this experience paper we describe what we have learned about the field's interests with respect to adopting RPP approaches to the work.

Such extracted knowledge helps to find out what other people think about the particular product or service. With the growing availability of resources like online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden growth in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational techniques for opinion extraction and understanding created an utmost need to understand and view the Web in a different prospect. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion-mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.

AB  - The results obtained by the elementary school students in subjects like math and Portuguese mother language have been worrisome during the last few years. There are several reasons for this, but opinions point to the student's inability to solve problems, difficulties in logical reasoning and lack of critical attitude. The Portuguese Ministry of Education proposed in 2015/2016, in extracurricular period, the Getting Started with Programming challenging in primary School activities, with the intention of promoting computational thinking competences in students. Two schools from Coimbra city opted to use Scratch software for the implementation of this project aiming to promote school success in subjects already mentioned. The project, based on the academic curriculum of 4th grade, intends to link the theoretical knowledge with the practical knowledge, promoting the characteristic values of the city of Coimbra. This project implementation resulted in different applications (computer games) created by students, covering the contents of the mentioned subjects, but concretizing these knowledge with the socio-cultural and environmental realities of the city of Coimbra. The following study demonstrates the results obtained in 5 classes in 2015-2016 and six classes in 2016-2017, according to student satisfaction and project evaluation.

AB  - One of the grand challenges of the future generation intelligent systems is how to build a robot which can think in a way similar to human beings. In this case, cognitive robotics attempts to embed cognitive abilities of the natural intelligence, specially the human brain, in robotics applications. To provide the context of such an objective, an interdisciplinary approach which is a merger of different fields of study like artificial intelligence, cognitive informatics, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience, should be adopted. In this paper, to design the behavioral mechanism of adventurous robots, the Motivation/Attitude-Driven Behavior (MADB) model, which is a plausible computational model of human behavior with the purpose of simulating robots equipped with basic humanoid emotions, is exploited. As a result, the proposed model has provided adventurous robots with the capability of showing emotional behaviors. Finally, adventurous robots and conventional ones are separately implemented in a virtual ecosystem and their effort for survival is compared. Consequently, the simulation results show that adventurous robots have a greater chance to survive in the simulated environment.

AB  - According to the Code.org there are currently 528,174 open computing jobs in U.S. and only 49,291 computer science students graduated into the workforce, last year. In order to try to reverse this scenario, several countries are working on a way to include computer science concepts, like computational thinking, in their curriculums for K-12 education. In addition, many studies and researches are being done related to practices and tools that can be applied in order to retain students that applied for computer science courses. In order to contribute to these initiatives, this paper presents CODEX, an interactive and ludic learning object, that aims to help students that do not need to have a background in programming to learn one of the most important structure in a programming language, the loop. CODEX was designed to be used both in class and in extra-class activity.

AB  - Connectivity Matrix Algorithm (CMA) is a straightforward algorithm presented to obtain the optimal location of the PMUs in any system. This paper proposed a modification to the connectivity matrix algorithm (MCMA) to consider n-1 criteria. The modified algorithm is valid to get the optimal PMU placement thinking of any level of redundancy in the measurements at any location. The modified algorithm is validated by considering zero injection bus (ZIB) and without for the double redundancy condition. The algorithm applies to different size test systems: IEEE-14 bus, IEEE-30 bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE-118 bus. The computational time of the MCMA is less than 10% of the fastest algorithm in the literature.

AB  - In 1999 I had the honor of presenting a Keynote talk entitled "Databases Unplugged: Challenges in Ubiquitous Data Management" at the inaugural MDM conference in Hong Kong. In that talk I spoke about the anticipated ubiquity of mobile devices and mobile applications and predicted some of the data management research challenges that could be foreseen from this sea change in the computational landscape. My views at the time were in sync with the influential Asilomar Report on Database Research [1], published in 1998, to which I contributed. The Asilomar report featured mobile devices as a "major driver" for the data management research agenda and predicted that "In ten years, billions of people will be using the Web, but a trillion "gizmos" will also be connected to the Web." Despite this optimism, The research agenda I described in my MDM talk [2] was driven in many ways by what I saw as the expected limitations of the mobile environment. Among these were: intermittent connectivity, poor battery life, and low-function user interfaces. Thus, my expectation was that technologies such as synchronization and conflict resolution, broadcast-based data dissemination, micro-kernel database systems and context-aware prefetching were technologies that would play a central role in making such devices usable as data management platforms. Rolling the clock forward twelve years, it appears that the Asilomar prediction of the number of connected devices was overly optimistic by about 3 orders of magnitude, and the technical limitations I was concerned about were substantially mitigated by tremendous innovation in mobile devices and mobile user interfaces as well as massive global investment in wireless infrastructure. On the other hand, we were both right about the huge impact of mobile computing on the way people acquire, interact with, and share information, and the fact that the ubiquity of such devices would have profound implications for data management. Undeterred by the paper trail outlined above, in this talk I plan to survey the state of the mobile data management field as it stands twelve years later. I'll review progress in areas such as sensor networks, integration with cloud computing, and location-based services. I'll also discuss what I see as a fundamental game changer brought about by mobile technology the closer integration of people into the entire data management lifecycle [3]. Social computing, crowd sourcing, and hyper-personalization are examples of ways in which the personalized nature of mobile devices is changing the way that we interact with information. I'll argue that such human-centric concerns will cause a rethinking of systems architectures and their components, and will require new ways of thinking about query processing, data quality and data-intensive applications. And if I get to do this again in 2023, we'll see how that turns out.

AB  - This research work proposes the framework for seaport partners to interact on a semantic level and scope related with jurisdictions/ecosystems and regions to share knowledge among partners. New steps towards dealing with the traditional common sense for managing or governing the seaport are required for assisting the new generation of managers and port authorities. Sematic intelligence answers dilemmas of complex realities and alignments of strategies such as which strategic position may have the seaport facing the growing number of international networks and international treaties. In Management and Computational Sciences, semantic intelligence has been discussed mostly from technological perspectives; however, a higher thinking intelligence for managing and govern the seaport surplus the classical intelligence approach found in literature.

AB  - Computational thinking in recent years has been universally defined as the ”new English”, or basic knowledge necessary for everyone. As English, is important to include it as early as possible in teaching programs, right from preschool. This need is so felt as to make it, for example, compulsory in kindergarten in Italy since 2022. Obviously, this implies the use of simple tools that do not provide reading and writing skills. This work proposes a learning program which could be carried out precisely during the three years of kindergarten, from 3 to 6 years of age, and prepares children for coding, a teaching subject that has already been proposed in Italy for primary school since a few years.

AB  - This paper studies spatial smoothing using sparse arrays in single-snapshot Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. We consider the application of automotive MIMO radar, which traditionally synthesizes a large uniform virtual array by appropriate waveform and physical array design. We explore deliberately introducing holes into this virtual array to leverage resolution gains provided by the increased aperture. The presence of these holes requires re-thinking DOA estimation, as conventional algorithms may no longer be easily applicable and alternative techniques, such as array interpolation, may be computationally expensive. Consequently, we study sparse array geometries that permit the direct application of spatial smoothing. We show that a sparse array geometry is amenable to spatial smoothing if it can be decomposed into the sum set of two subsets of suitable cardinality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many such decompositions may exist-not all of them yielding equal identifiability or aperture. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee identifiability of a given number of targets, which gives insight into choosing desirable decompositions for spatial smoothing. This provides uniform recovery guarantees and enables estimating DOAs at increased resolution and reduced computational complexity. 1

AB  - In this paper, a simple and practical new algorithm was proposed to solve the monocular vision-based camera positioning of spatial objects as well as the alternating invariance principle based on projective geometry. The new algorithm avoids the cumbersome camera calibration and the accurate solution of matrix equations. It solves the non-linear single-mapping of single chart taken by non-standard orders CCD camera from the 2D image plane to the true 3D planar according to a simple geometrical relationship. It also revises the lens to reach the high accuracy and the low computational. The experimental result shows that this new algorithm has a high availability in several cases, and it provides a new way of thinking for the measurement, positioning as well as three-dimensional reconstruction of the computer vision problems.

Moreover, most people do not know how to reduce electricity bills, gas, etc. and they spend large amounts of money because they believe that is the price to pay for these services. In this paper is presented a computational tool to analyze the influence of thermal insulation on heat transfer by conduction through the roof of a certain room. The application displays the advantages of installing thermal insulation in different weather conditions in various regions of Argentina, and provides economic arguments for design and evaluation of each work.

AB  - The demand for cybersecurity professionals is projected to grow substantially, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that employment in cybersecurity within the US will grow by 18% from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.

AB  - The research-to-practice paper presents applications of genetic algorithms using multi-criterion optimization to designate student-teams in an academic setting. Teamwork skills are becoming a more desirable trait in industry today and hence more instructors are using teamwork in their engineering courses. ABET also requires engineering degree programs to have student outcomes that provide them with "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives." This, however, comes with its challenges because the literature suggests that random or student-selected teams tend to lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Instructor-designated academic teams based on skills, learning personalities, and demographics are known to be more effective in promoting learning and positive interactions. Creating optimal homogeneous or heterogeneous teams based on multiple criteria (e.g., prior knowledge, skills, abilities, psychosocial, demographics) can be a complex and time-consuming task when done manually, especially when large numbers of students are involved.This study presents an expansion of previous work that used single-criterion genetic algorithm optimization of teams in a first-year classroom. The research question answered in this study is, how do teams formed using an algorithm that optimizes multiple criteria with genetic algorithms represent heterogeneity when compared to teams formed manually? Using a Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), optimization of multiple skills is conducted to attain uniform heterogeneity in the classroom. The algorithm uses discrete integer-type representations as a basic unit of team configuration. Self-reported student competency data on three different computational skills were used. Teams were formed for approximately 1300 students enrolled in a first-year engineering design thinking course at a large Midwestern University. Four-member teams were maximized with a minimum number of teams with 3 students in each section. Average skills of the teams are calculated and the standard deviation in class is minimized for each of three skills parallelly. The algorithm also aims to maintain diversity of teams based on gender and ethnicity.Results presented include visualization of team-configurations and comparison with teams formed manually using the same criteria. The aim of the algorithm is to optimize students into teams that have skills and demographics uniformly distributed across the classroom. Future implications of this study include the potential to use flexible algorithm-based team formations that are built with standard genetic operators so that optimization criteria can be modified by the instructor. Such algorithms can reduce the time needed to manually form teams by a considerable amount and optimize the distribution of skills more uniformly. Steps to further this study will involve investigating whether teams formed using these criteria are more effective.

AB  - According to the feature that normal data and abnormal data in wireless sensor networks have no significant difference, this paper proposes intrusion detection model based on D-S evidence theory. Intrusion detection model views the standard deviation between data flow and historical data of each sensor as intrusion detection feature value, and then all these values treated as a group of data will be clustered. At last, the model fuses the clustering results by using D-S evidence theory to obtain a comprehensive assessment result, which can reflect the security of the sensor. The way of this algorithm to recognize the target is similar to human thinking, with high reliability, and has obvious advantages on computational complexity.

AB  - Very High Resolution (VHR) multispectral Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) enables the production of temporal land cover maps, thanks to high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution of modern earth observation programs. Besides, statistical learning methods applied to SITS monitoring and analysis have created relatively efficient semi-automatic classification techniques. It would therefore be natural to think that the use of deep learning methods on SITS would lead to advances comparable to those known in the field of computer vision. However, when applied to concrete cases, the results are not as convincing. This paper proposes a comparison between a SOTAG (Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs) SVM based spatio-temporal classification approach and the Recurrent Neuronal Network (RNN), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model which is trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Both methods perform a spatio-temporal map indicating the temporal profiles of cartographic regions. The proposed approaches will be applied on real and simulated SITS data. We will demonstrate that both results are comparable despite computational times and algorithms complexity.

AB  - Texture analysis on digital images can be used to correctly segment areas of an image and/or classify different objects within the field of view of a digital camera. Depending on the application, one can use a Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to detect patterns or a simple contrast measure such as variance can be a good metric as well. In this work, our main objective is to define a set of new texture metrics simple enough to be computationally efficient so that fast processing is feasible. Thus in our previous two texture techniques mentioned before, GLCM and variance, metrics such as variance would be selected for comparison purposes as they require less computational time. Thinking outside the box, we would like to introduce the use of income inequality metrics used in the field of economy to measure the distribution of income and wealth inequality within a population. We found that these metrics can be used on texture analysis of digital images.

AB  - The Associative Pattern Classifier (CAP) is a novel approach to solve the pattern classification problem. Recent experiments of the behavior of this classifier in different applications have given encouraging results. Due a this evidence, It has been thinking about the existence of a minimum number for which a higher value of samples used in the learning phase of this classifier brings a very low effect over their classification performance. This paper present an empiric way to obtain this minimum number based in the structure of the used database. this method allows us to define a minimum size for the set used in the learning phase of CAP for which the final classification performance will be reasonably stable, optimizing time and computational resources in the process.

AB  - The impact of robotics has grown beyond research laboratories and industrial facilities into home environments and primary and secondary school classrooms. Of particular interest to us are robots for education. In general, educational robotics kits are expensive and proprietary, or cheap and unreliable. This research seeks to bridge that gap by providing a hands on open-source robotics learning environment that is both inexpensive and reliable. In this paper, we review the applicability of such environments to support the synergistic learning of computational thinking (CT) and STEM, with an emphasis on Computer Science (CS) concepts and practices. The CT and Advanced Placement CS Principles frameworks (from the US) govern the design and implementation of our system. We discuss the hardware system of the robot and the accompanying software architecture that runs on Linux-based single board computers. We conclude with results from a small pilot study analyzing the usability and curricular effectiveness of the system.

AB  - What is "Trust"? Everybody has a sense of trusting people or institutions, but how is trust defined? The definition of trust always depends on the specific field of research and application, which makes it hard to answer this question in general at a computational level. Thinking of knowledge processing systems we face this question twice. How can we define and calculate trust values for the input data and, more challenging, what is the trust value of the output? Within this paper we consider a binary, a probabilistic, an opinion-space and - our recently developed approach - a weighted arithmetic mean trust model. Then we show ways, how knowledge processing systems can handle these trust values and propagate them through a network of processing steps in a way that the final results are representative. With these presented and developed models, we can give insights to the topic of defining and propagating trust in knowledge processing systems.

Utilizing the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu), key areas such as Professional Engagement, Teaching and Learning, and Open Education were scrutinized. Findings indicated a competent level in Professional Engagement, yet they revealed that teachers are still at initial stages regarding the integration of digital tools in teaching and the use of open educational resources. Although variables like gender, age, and academic background showed no significant differences, it was noted that both the technological infrastructure of institutions and support for professional development positively impact digital competences. This underlines the importance of reinforcing educational policies related to training and digital resources to promote a substantial improvement in mathematics teaching, as a key factor for the development of students’ critical and computational thinking.

AB  - Humans daily infer causal structure from patterns of correlation and learn about categories and hidden properties of objects based on experience and knowledge. A Bayesian approach seems to best model human reasoning over structures, relations and links, and it is possible to provide a detailed computational account of how a number of basic structural forms can be inferred from various types of data (feature sets, similarity matrices, relations). In the literature some algorithms have been proposed that generate candidate model structures from graph grammars, compute the probability of the data given each candidate model, and identify the model with maximum posterior probability given the data. The structural representation, being generated by algorithms comparable to human thinking (according to the cognitive sciences community) should be also easily understandable and usable by analysts for further investigation.

AB  - Autonomous swarm control, which is expected to be able to handle multiple unmanned vehicles (UxVs), is an important technology that can be applied to many operations and incorporated in many systems. For operations in real environments, we have to consider severe conditions under which communications between UxVs may be inadequate and the environment changes unexpectedly. In addition to optimality, adaptability (meaning robustness to severe and unexpected conditions) is important in real situations. However, there are no quantitative benchmarks for algorithms to have both optimality and adaptability. Here, to reconcile optimality and adaptability, we have developed an “autonomous and adaptive control”. The distinctive features of this algorithm is that it simply uses the purposes of a system, such as efficiencies, to control elements and it has a distributed optimization architecture without a centralized control unit. We think that it is promising for autonomous swarm control with optimality and adaptability in real environments. In this paper, we benchmark several swarm control algorithms including our own. We compare two conventional algorithms with ours in a scenario involving a continuous search operation where the UxVs keep moving and searching. We also devise performance indicators for this operation and evaluate the algorithms in terms of them. The results obtained from computational simulations show that our algorithm maintains the efficiency of the search operation at a high level. That means the algorithm is a promising approach for achieving both optimality and adaptability.

AB  - An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics.

AB  - Distributed storage, which is one of the main functions of distributed computing, enables clients of cloud services to think of their data as being stored in the cloud and to share it with qualified customers. In distributed storage, stable deduplication has been widely researched because it can eliminate overt repetitiveness within scrambled data to reduce storage space significantly. In the field of safety and protection, many current continuous deduplication schemes highlight to a large extent the associated characteristics: information classification, label consistency, access control animal attack assaults. One technique for ensuring the accuracy of information in garage outsourcing is confirmed information possession. The article discusses the development of a green PDP scheme for a distributed cloud garage to facilitate provider migration scalability and statistics, where we keep in mind the lifecycle of multiple cloud service providers to maintain and maintain collaborative customer statistics. The cooperative scheme relies entirely on verifiable homomorphic reactions. Completeness, knowledge soundness, and zero-knowledge qualities may all be satisfied by our multi-proof zero-knowledge proof system, which strengthens the security of our system. The experiment shows that this solution has lower computational and communication overhead than non-cooperative approaches.

AB  - The human brain is a marvel of complex and dynamic networks that enable us to move, sense, think, and remember. How do these networks constantly reconfigure themselves in real-time to process information? To answer this question, we need reliable methods able to capture the dynamics of the dominant functional 'states'. However, this task is challenging due to the diversity of the available pipelines that are difficult to evaluate. Here, we present an overview of a computational framework that combines electrophysiological data with dynamic functional connectivity approach (dFC) followed by dimensionality reduction methods. We highlighted the utility of such framework in tracking the dynamics of key brain network states. Then, we provide a practical example on real MEG data during fast motor task. Our analysis evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework including several instances of decomposition and clustering techniques in capturing relevant spatial and temporal patterns of brain network reconfiguration.

AB  - Compliance management is a critical financial and legal subject for organizations. It is operationally implemented by embedding internal controls into business processes and their supporting IT systems. Challenges arise from the complexity of real-life processes and systems, their continuous monitoring and the timely communication of thereby detected problems. In order to realize effective and efficient monitoring, the responsible persons must be supported by suitable compliance software. This compliance software should enable the responsible persons to get both high-level information regarding the overall compliance status and low-level information regarding possible problems. Furthermore, it should not be limited to passive reporting components for compliance management, but also allow for interactive user interfaces, which facilitate the proactive supervision of tasks. The aim of this work is to encourage the responsible persons to analyze and explore compliance information through their appropriate visualization. Thus, unique and valuable human strengths, such as lateral thinking, can be used aside from the computational strengths of compliance software during control monitoring.

AB  - Social network is one of the vibrant topic and allow researcher to think in various dimension to provide results with wide scope. In this paper we are aimed at optimizing cluster to enhance the result. It helps to increase the computational performance of a social network as well as maintaining the valid nodes for bidirectional interaction between end users. Proposed methodology applies Girvan Newman clustering algorithm along with minimum cut algorithm for optimization purpose which makes effective interaction with in social communication network. Our research includes two major phases in it. During first phase we apply Girvan Newman algorithm to cluster the nodes with common behavior, properties and characteristics. In the second phase, application of minimum cut algorithm will be done into clustered social network nodes. The major objective is to analyze network nodes and make them stable and active and to remove the nodes that are not interacting with any network nodes that is inactive nodes. Such inactive nodes make the less efficiency and inaccurate communication. For these kind of problem, we are going to apply minimum cut algorithm. It will maximize the effective bidirectional interaction by removing the unwanted, noisy and inconsistent nodes from these clusters.

AB  - This research to practice work in progress has two main objectives: i) the improvement of interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes in an integrated course of informatics in high school course and; ii) turning students into learners by the designing and development of innovative features for m-learning applications. Such objectives are integrated each other, since the improvement in the teaching and learning processes will not be restricted in the proposal and use of a practical framework for the improvement of students' skills in the computational thinking, but also in the use of the m-learning features and applications to improve educational issues faced by both students and teachers. In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students. In this paper it is discussed the motivations about the proposal of this project, the teaching and learning implications in the context of a integrated course of informatics in high school course, its planning and a pilot conduction of mainly initial activities with the volunteers students. Such activities include: (a) the identification of problems and the planning of solutions based on m-learning features; (b) the design and development phases of an initial set features; and (c) a preliminary evaluation of usability of some mockups of m-learning application. At the end, the identified evidence are discussed, mainly those related with the implications for the interdisciplinary scenario for the teaching and learning processes, the initial identification of benefits in the perspective of the participation of students as learners and the future work, as well.

AB  - Data Mining is a computational process of discovering a certain pattern in huge datasets. It is an essential process where technical processes are applied to get patterns. Alzheimer's disease should be detected very early so that preventive measures can be taken. Alzheimer's disease is a chronic disorder that worsens over time. AD is a disease which progresses slowly and is characterized by loss of neurons. The symptoms of dementia keep on worsening over a number of years. It leads to loss of memory which disrupts the life of that person. Reasoning skills and thinking ability is also affected. The most spread disease in Western Europe is dementia and it is least spread in Sub-Saharan Africa. On an average rate, two in three people with Alzheimer are women.

AB  - How do Oprah, the multimedia mogul, and Edison, the inventor of the telephone, both inspire teachers and students to learn computational thinking? A CS/CT focused module was developed by two grade 4 teachers that would introduce culturally relevant role models to students in an urban school district. The module engages students through a “Choose Your Own Adventure” activity focusing on perseverance and conditionals. Students create Scratch projects, using a Makey Makey, to model what would happen if one of their historical role models gave up on their dreams. This module is just one example of the nineteen modules created by members of CSforALL Springfield, a Research Practice Partnership working with the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts. The partnership allows for collaboration between educators from Springfield, MA Public Schools and Researchers from the University. We will spotlight this module to show how the module was designed and taught to make it an engaging, equitable learning experience for all students and share their learning outcomes along the way. Our goal is to share how we designed and integrated culturally responsive Computer Science curriculum at the elementary level that will ensure equitable learning for all students. Our goal is to show how we engaged dyads in a design based collaborative process to produce a module for their grade level.

AB  - The Department of Computer Science at Hampton University was awarded the HBCU-UP TIP Project to reform three gateway courses and implement an intensive computing summer bridge program (SBP) in an effort to improve student academic performance and increase retention and graduation rates in the major. By integrating Computational Thinking into lower-level courses, the proposed project also seeks to strengthen Computer Science students and better prepare them to meet the modern demands in the field. In the first year of the project there have been several changes to the curriculum content of the gateway courses as well as the implementation of the summer pre-college program. The summer 2014 was the first computing pre-college program. There were nineteen participants currently in the summer program. The students were engaged and excited to be a part of this program. The Computer Science Seminar course served as the initiative for a supplemental undergraduate research award request. The course focused not only ensuring the students understand computer science as a field of study, but also how computer science impacts all fields of study and everything in their daily lives. There were several speakers, FBI, Industry, University faculty, and previous graduates. The initial results has been extremely rewarding as we noticed from their performance in the first semester program course, CS1. This poster will discuss the curriculum we used during the summer program, sample exercises, feedback from students as well as lesson learnt for us to improve next year program.

AB  - Computer science unplugged (CS unplugged) is a method of teaching computer science and computational thinking. The aim of our study is to illustrate program behavior and to prevent confusion about the program stack through visualization. To facilitate recognition, we used a toy consisting of a ball, pipes, and magnetic panels. The ball represents which line of code is executed, similar to the program counter. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present three examples based on the proposed method. The examples are necessity of loop to wait user input, necessity of loop to keep program running, and software testing. We conducted an experiment with nine participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result suggested that the proposed method is expected to be effective.

AB  - 6G is currently under definition, often being addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.

AB  - The STEM methodology has been applied in different study approaches, covering different areas such as arts, internet of things, computational thinking, among others. In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.

AB  - In this competitive industry era, industry should think about how to efficient their process of production. In the foundry and smelting industry, downtime not only increases make span and reduces machine availability, but also increases energy consumption. That means strategy to keep the production stabile is very important to minimize energy wasting. This condition need good condition machinery, and required optimum maintenance strategy. Modeling Production planning system with machine unavailability intervals has gained more attention to life cycle cost of manufacturing companies. Modelling production planning subjected to maintenance activities decreases machine degradation rate and unscheduled unavailability that may result lower breakdown of production. In this paper will In this paper, we propose Bi-objective optimization approach for energy aware scheduling considering continuous energy consumption cost and preventive maintenance multi resource (machine and dies as tools). Multi objective goal programming is proposed to solve this problem. The extensive computational experiments are conducted. The results show that the integrated optimization method of production scheduling and preventive maintenance outperforms the method with Corrective maintenance as a case study model for this problem, results also show the effects of different flexibilities of resources for job processing.

AB  - Computational thinking has become pervasive across many technical and creative disciplines. Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Diversity within computing is a persistent problem; in 2014, several large tech companies released diversity reports and made commitments to improvement. As of 2020, improvements have been minor, especially for Black employees. Compared to US demographics, the percentage of Black and Latinx students pursuing degrees in computing remains low, even as numbers improve in STEM more broadly. It is more important than ever to prioritize a diverse computing workforce and a computationally literate workforce, more broadly, whose interests reside with equitable outcomes.

AB  - In this paper, a novel gradient descent learning algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) applied on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is proposed in order to approximate the functions which have high non-linear order. How we can choose the strategy of gradient descent including learning coefficients selecting and really is it optimized to learn the same for all feature vectors?, are the challenges made us to think precisely on those. In this study, GMM estimates the probability density of the feature space and then the optimal learning rates can be evaluated proportional to these probabilities. These cause the neurons to learn correspondence with the feature distribution likelihoods. Considering robust satellite subset selection, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) factor is calculated for all subset of satellites and then the subset with lowest value is selected for positioning, but it is so non-linear and has computational burden to navigation systems. We use the proposed method to approximate it. The results on real GPS measurements demonstrate that it significantly track the non-linearity of GPS GDOP.

AB  - Hyperspectral images occupy a very important position when it comes to remote sensing imaging due to their multi band and high precision characteristics. However, due to the redundancy caused by various bands and the large amount of calculation, Reducing the size of hyperspectral photographs is important. This article proposes a program that combines cross genetic thinking with artificial bee colony algorithm (hereinafter referred to as Ag) to select the features of hyperspectral images, In the preprocessing stage, the initial feature set of the image is screened by using the outlier detection method based on the percentage level, and the feature set after the initial screening is selected by Ag algorithm. Finally, the selected band combination is sent to the neural network combining three-dimensional convolution and two-dimensional convolution for training, Experimental results on the Pavia University and Indian Pines datasets show that the algorithm has good convergence, and the band combination obtained with low computational complexity can achieve better classification accuracy and consistency in image classification.

AB  - Human beings will be living in a ubiquitous world in which all information technology devices are fully networked so that they can offer us desired services at any place and anytime. This shift has hastened the ubiquitous revolution, which has further manifested itself in the new multidisciplinary research area, ubiquitous robotics. It initiates the third generation of robotics following the first generation of the industrial robot and the second generation of the personal robot. A fairy tale introduced Genie, which upon springing from a lamp served Aladdin. The ubiquitous era brings us to the threshold of the realization of this dream, through ubiquitous robotics. Moreover, the robots shall have their own genome in which a specific personality is encoded. This concept leads to the research on genetic robotics. Cyber-physical robot system (CPRS) combines these new concepts of next generation robots for the convergence of computational and physical systems. This talk introduces the recent progress and development of ubiquitous robot, genetic robot and CPRS along with the new classification of robot intelligence. Ubiquitous robot is composed of three forms of robots: software robot, embedded robot and mobile robot to represent an amalgamation of the tripartite personification of entities of perception, thinking and action. Genetic robot has its own genetic codes to represent a specific personality. CPRS conjoins and coordinates the software agents and physical robots including software and hardware resources. Special emphasis in this talk is placed on intelligence technology for the CPRS to realize cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioural intelligence, ambient intelligence, genetic intelligence and swarm intelligence. The intelligence technology shall provide us with seamless, calm, and context-aware services in a networked environment.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for decode-and-forward (DF) relay-assisted SC-FDMA systems. Considering the subcarrier adjacency restriction of SC-FDMA, we present an optimal algorithm which refers to the set partitioning problem. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal resource allocation, we also propose a suboptimal algorithm which is based on the greedy heuristic thinking. Simulation results show that the spectral efficiency of the optimal algorithm is much higher than that of the round robin algorithm. It is also shown that the greedy algorithm, which has much lower complexity, performs quite close to the optimal algorithm.

AB  - There is much thinking nowadays about unsanctioned access to personal information. Different strategies have been suggested in survey process, since authors suggest augments with respect to expenditure and process evaluation instance therefore it depends on ciphering the complete information. This article expresses an introduction to cloud computational schema which differentiates information reckoning on significant properties. Most precisely the significant user information would get encrypted with secure encryption algorithm provided with better key size, where in lower significant information may not be ciphered. This methodology helps debasing the process charges and complicatedness of information storage, since there is no compulsion for applying similar refined encryption procedure for all user records. The outcome of introducing suggested schema results in exhibition of amelioration and effectiveness than further open frameworks. There are few of the embellishments chosen and it can be known in the following pages basically to suit the modern demands.

AB  - Digital With a growing global population comes a correspondingly higher need for food, making plant disease modernization in agricultural areas a top priority for all nations. Improving productivity is crucial to India’s economy. Consequently, the detection of disease in greeneries plays a key role in the development sector. The accuracy and precision of diagnosing diseases in plants and animals have also been enhanced by the increased use of expertise in modern times. One solution to the problem of classifying different populations is the prospect of grouping in AI techniques. We aim to provide insight into the present state of the illnesses and how to detect them rapidly using computational reasoning. The article suggests thinking about how to use AI techniques to automatically detect plant diseases. This research paper uses the O-RPN (Optimized District Proposition Network) to isolate and control the leaves in a complicated ecosystem. The O-RPN computation incorporates the signs component using Chan-Vese (CV) techniques. The district-based CV calculation yields encouraging results for noise- and weak-edge-free image segmentation. In addition, we compare CNN and SVM using a unique dataset related to plant illnesses.

AB  - In literature, we find many examples showing that, contrary to what one might think, multimodal remote sensing analysis might be suboptimal. Given the high computational complexity typically required by multimodal investigation in order to properly extract information from multiple sources, there is a need to assess its actual benefit during image preprocessing. This urgency becomes indeed crucial when targeting transfer learning in remote sensing, as understanding the actual relationship between diverse sensors is fundamental to accurately characterize the considered scenes. In this work, we derive a reliability metric by means of an information theory-based approach. The proposed metric is able to estimate how confident one can be of the considered datasets when characterizing each pixel in the considered region of interest. Experimental results on real datasets show how this quantity can be used to improve the understanding of the scenes, and to enhance multisensor transfer learning.

AB  - Whether we think of interaction design as a design tradition aimed at giving form to interaction with and through computational objects or as being about user interface design, it is hard to escape the fact that the user interface to a large extent defines the scene and the form of the interaction. Without adopting a fully deterministic perspective, it is nevertheless a fact that if the user interface is screen-based and graphical and the input modality is mouse-based, then it is likely that the form of that interaction—that is, what the turn-taking looks like and what is demanded by the user—is very similar to other screen-based interfaces with similar input devices. However, the design space for the form of interaction is growing quickly. While command-based interfaces and text-based interfaces defined almost the whole design space in the 1970s, developments since then, including novel ways of bringing sensors, actuators, and smart materials to the user interface, have certainly opened up a broader design space for interaction design.

AB  - Depigmentation of the skin is a primary symptom of the vitiligo disorder. By reducing their self-esteem and causing them psychological distress, it lowers patients’ quality of life. The study made use of a number of computational tools, including Cyto Hubba, BioVia Discovery Studio through, Open babel, Drug bank, Avogadro, Auto dock, and Protein-Interaction Ligand profiler. The interaction between 6AAH and (Myristic acid, Heptadecanoic acid, Riboflavin, Propanol, 2,6-Dimethyl-7-octene-2,3,6-trio1) has been examined in this study using Cyto Hubba and PILP clustering interactions, followed by Molecular Docking of Protein and Ligand. Due to its polygenic nature, vitiligo is frequently associated with a number of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, including thyroid disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, diabetes mellitus, and pernicious anaemia. Hence, it is conceivable to think about riboflavin as a possible drug for Vitiligo treatment. The findings imply that riboflavin laboratory tests reveal its inhibitory potential on skin depigmentation

AB  - We are witnessing a remarkable comeback of computer programming in schools. While computers seem to be accessible everywhere, particularly outside school, where children and youth are connecting to wider networks of other young users, their capacity to wield such devices critically, creatively, and selectively is decidedly less potent. Learning the language of computers introduces students to processes for thinking and solving problems and for engaging creatively and critically with digital media. Using the example of electronic textiles—computational artifacts in which circuits are stitched with conductive thread to connect microcontrollers and control sensors and actuators, I describe how we can broaden access, diversify representation, and deepen learning. More importantly, I illustrate how the introduction of crafting with computing in schools that serve marginalized populations can help diversify who makes and the kinds of artifacts that are being made, how projects can introduce more complex programming concepts and practices, and what kind of tools we can design to support novice programmers in coding and debugging hybrid artifacts.

A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues.

Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.

AB  - In this paper we consider the control problem of ensemble of trajectories for one In recent years, the importance of discrete mathematics has increased dramatically. This is not the name of a branch of mathematics such as number theory, algebra, calculus. This is a separate branch of knowledge, which is called “discrete” (individual). However, there are also processes of continuous mathematics, that is, it becomes a continuous whole. Discrete data can only take integer values, while continuous data can take any value. Discrete mathematics was created several decades ago and is the mathematical language of computer science. Scientists have found that the mathematical disciplines taught in universities are insufficient for learning a programming language. Therefore, they combine additional maths topics into one course, now called discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is the foundation of computer science and theoretical computer science. Without learning discrete mathematics, we miss the essence of the logic of computer science. Due to the multiplicity of objects within discrete mathematics, rational clarity in solving programming issues is possible. Every field in computer science is associated with discrete objects, be it databases, network components, computer organization, compilers, network programming, and so on. Essentially, discrete mathematics studies the concepts of counting, mathematical structures, logic, recursion, computational modeling, graph theory and algorithms, and many other disciplines. Evidence, a basic concept in discrete mathematics that includes deductive thinking, simplification, pattern identification, mathematical notation, working within constraints and conditions. This does not mean that a formal course in discrete mathematics is necessary or should be required for programmers. However, many of the concepts discussed in discrete mathematics are applied using this science. In this article, we will look at the basic postulates of discrete mathematics that are necessary to learn the basics of programming.

AB  - Most of today's approaches to introductory computer science education reflect a 1970s view of computer science: students typically create single-threaded programs that do local IO. Some of the technologies used within these educational experiences include post-70s visual language elements like blocks to assist with the syntax of programming, but the semantics of the programming have generally remained frozen in time. Yet, the field of computer science has progressed enormously since the 1970s: multi-core computing, distributed systems, and machine learning are now ubiquitous, and have deep philosophical and practical ramifications for computer science education, including our definitions of what computational thinking is, and for how we design new programming languages, including visual languages. I will compare the current state of the art of novice programming tools and theories to the current state of computer science, and describe how new conceptual frameworks and visual programming tools could support contemporary computer science education.
