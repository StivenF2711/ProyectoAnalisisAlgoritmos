AB  - Technological devices programmed through parallel computing are increasingly present in people's daily lives. They are responsible for processing images that we see on computers, televisions, cell phones and games. It is a fact that parallel processing is a reality, so computer professionals need to know the peculiarities of this form of programming. However, teaching parallel computing is not a simple task, the computational thinking parallel is quite different from that for the sequential processing. This work, then proposes a new methodology for teaching parallel computing for young beginners in programming. Our technique is based on principles of unplugged computing, like to learn doing and playing. We believe that unplugged computing can be very useful in teaching the difficult concepts of parallel computing 1

AB  - New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.

AB  - Learning how to program has become a trend in Taiwan even for younger students. IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance.

This methodology is illustrated via a set of examples focused on specific engineering problems, but its scope can also be widened to other scientific areas. The examples presented on this paper allow concluding that this approach may be an interesting way to re-think and complement the perspective usually considered in the transmission of mathematical concepts. The use of a freeware finite element method computational package, FreeFEM++ may also be an important issue to stimulate the dissemination of this phenomena modelling and comprehension approach.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to grade programming exam questions automatically. Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises. The use of these techniques provides specific scores to obtain a grade of the student’s answer. The source code analysis and scoring of exercise answers is carried out using high-performance computing for improving system response time. This research contributes a scalable method for the automatic evaluation of exams, which we expect to support the development of PC.

AB  - As blended learning models gain popularity, analyzing the online learning behaviors of college students has emerged as a crucial approach to enhancing teaching effectiveness. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the learning behavior data from 44 students specializing in computer-related subjects on the online platform of the “Introduction to Computational Thinking” course, utilizing clustering algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient method to delve into the intricate relationship between diverse behavioral traits and academic performance. Our research has revealed that cluster analysis is adept at discerning behavioral disparities among students. Specifically, we identified four types of learning groups with different learning characteristics. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between homework scores and key evaluation metrics, including academic performance. Based on these findings, this study proposes targeted learning strategies and teaching suggestions, aiming to help educators better guide students in learning and improve the effectiveness of blended learning.

AB  - The rapid spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the adoption of social distancing and "stay-at-home" orders gave rise to the sudden need for schools to be able to provide effective remote teaching. In Italy and elsewhere, the introduction of distance learning technologies has significantly impacted the education of students and limited their social interaction and activities, among which are school trips and other scholastic experiences. To support the constrained educational possibilities of Italian schools, we developed "ActiveViewer", a technological platform that enables massive and interactive remote events, and performed a year-long large-scale experiment, providing a series of massive remote school trips to several Italian cities. We designed a new school trip format, named "CodyTrip" that merges coding and computational thinking with elements of traditional school outings, and provides an engaging experience for participants. In this paper, we present the format and five online trips performed during the school year 2020/2021. The results based on user feedback support the adoption of the tool not only as a stopgap measure for school outings throughout the pandemic but as an accessible and inclusive tool to widen the possibilities of cultural tourism.

The basic therapy approach is to modify the original voice and to present it back to his/her ear. By hearing the altered signal, he/she thinks someone else is talking the same words together, which results in a natural fluent speech. Our system modifies the voice pitch frequency and reduces background noise. The output signal produces a comfortable and natural altered feedback voice. The hardware implementation with a low-cost DSP processor presents a satisfactory real-time computational performance and low energy consumption.

AB  - Creating computing systems able to address our ever-increasing needs, especially as we reach the end of CMOS transistor scaling, will require truly novel methods of computing. However, the traditional logic abstractions and the digital design patterns we understand so well have coevolved with the hardware technology that has embodied them. As we look past CMOS, there is no reason to think that those same abstractions best serve to encapsulate the computational potential inherent to emerging devices. We posit that a new and radically more efficient foundation for computing lies at the intersection of superconductor electronics and delay-coded computation. Building on recent work in race logic, we show that superconducting circuits can naturally compute directly over temporal relationships between pulse arrivals; that the computational relationships between those pulse arrivals can be formalized through a functional extension to a temporal predicate logic used in the verification community; and that the resulting architectures can operate asynchronously and describe real and useful computations. We verify our hypothesis through a combination of detailed analog circuit models and layout designs, a formal analysis of our abstractions, and an evaluation of several superconducting temporal accelerators.

AB  - This innovative practice full paper presents a set of engaging actions aimed to encourage women to pursue a Computer Science career in a city of a third world country (Manaus, Brazil). Despite worldwide efforts to promote gender equality, typically, women account for less than 30% of the workforce in technological areas. In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected. The authors detail a program to involve girls from all school levels in computer science career, which is indeed the adaptation of a national program, combined with indigenous elements. The mentioned adaptation was a key success factor to catch the attention of students and local educators. Some activities that are included in this program are lectures at scientific, technological and gender discussion events, realization of dynamics in schools for the dissemination of computational thinking in children and young students, training students to take part in programming contests and develop knowledge into real computational applications. These actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields. Besides the fundamentals of the program, the authors present the results of the last three initiatives, which happened in conjunction with local events, and the promising opportunities perceived in Computer Science major of a local university.

AB  - In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.

AB  - The design of computational systems is an important matter that must be especially present in Computer Engineering curriculum. Traditionally, Computer Engineering curriculum address this theme in a compartmentalized way in specific curricular units. This organization creates a fragmented view of the complex computational systems development, understood here as the specification, design, implementation and integration of the lines of computer architecture and organization, systems engineering, compilers, operating systems and computer networks. To avoid this fragmented view, this article proposes a systemic and curricular approach, integrating hardware and software, which allows students to design a complex computer system over three years of their academic trajectories. This approach was validated in a Computer Engineering course at the Federal University of São Paulo, bringing positive results in relation to students' motivation and enthusiasm, as well as encouraging creative and innovative thinking.

AB  - Despite large strides in terms of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image generation, evaluating and comparing GANs remains an open question. Several measures have been introduced, however, there is no consensus in terms of the best score. In this paper, we delve into the widely-used metric Inception Score (based on KL divergence), revealing that it fails to detect intra-class mode collapse. Meanwhile, Wasserstein distance has received much attention in comparing distributions in recent years but suffers heavy computational burden in high dimensional space. Our idea is that we can find specific embedding space where Euclidean distance could mimic Wasserstein distance to solve the heavy computational problem. This space can be found using a Siamese network, which could be trained quickly because of shared weights. We also apply several proposed new techniques to get better image embedding. To evaluate our proposed metric (Siamese Score), we simulate mode collapse using K-means clustering performed on real data set. To further validate it, we perform an empirical study on several GAN models and use the generated images to do the task. Experiments show that Siamese Score can detect mode collapse and is time-efficient compared with Inception Score and we think our score can be complementary to Inception Score.

AB  - Nowadays the mobile devices energy consumption has become a very serious issue. Due to the fast growing mobile industry the current devices usually contain wireless (Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G and Bluetooth), GPS and other heavy network sensitive technologies. The cell battery manufacturers usually cannot keep the pace with this fast altering environment and demands, hence the devices get inappropriate battery. Recently many researchers deal with this topic trying to find out a reasonable solution for energy optimization without compromising the functionality of the devices. A possible approach to deal with the problem today and achieve the desired result is the code side optimization. The market based mobile application distribution model makes this challenge harder. Sometimes the code quality of the uploaded applications are poor and the market owners are not able to force the developers to write clear and energy efficient code, they can only give them recommendations. The question is coming up: how could we still encourage the individual developers and companies to write optimized and a bit more standardized code? The answer could be delivering them tools to facilitate the refactoring and code quality managing processes. One way we can deal with energy problem is to reorganize the heavy computational tasks out of the device to the cloud or to just another machine. This technique is called “offloading”. In this paper we are going to introduce a new code generation extension for software engineers which is aiming to automate the offload to web services. Those services can then be easily deployed to any desired location to ease the mobile devices computational task. We think this tool would be really helpful to the community and the industrial users also.

AB  - In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics help organizations and their human resources (HR) managers to reduce attrition by changing the way of attracting and retaining talent. In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that adding an attention mechanism to a convolutional neural network enhances network performance. However, in practice, the skewness error during the extraction process affects the feature information owing to the implementation of the global average pooling operation, which eventually lowers the performance of the network design. We think that when the weight is activated, the spatial information is effectively captured while the extraction range of the channel information is narrowed. We also think that because the weight is activated using multiple local extraction substitutions, the influence of skewness error can be effectively reduced. As a result, we suggest dimensionality reduction attention(RA) in this study as a new type of attention mechanism. Dimensionality reduction attention is a method of combining spatial information and channel information into a new feature distribution by aggregating dimensionality reduction of feature information, in contrast to other attentions that act on distinct feature tensors in space and channel. Under the premise of capturing long-distance context information and guaranteeing feature coordinates, it may realize the locality of spatial information through this operation and identify the local information of each channel. To completely display the important feature information, the produced feature maps are then encoded into two complimentary attention maps along the spatial and channel directions, respectively. Our dimension reduction focus is a straightforward and all-encompassing module. We run tests on various datasets using various deep architectures and various class designs. The outcomes of the trial demonstrate that our attention-based approach has clear benefits.

AB  - The recent growth in the demand for scalable applications from the consumers of the services has motivated the application development community to build and deploy the applications on cloud in the form of services. The deployed applications have significant dependency on the infrastructure available with the application providers. Bounded by the limitations of available resource pools on-premises, many application development companies have migrated the applications to third party cloud environments called data centers. The data center owners or the cloud service providers are entitled to ensure high performance and high availability of the applications and at the same time the desired scalability for the applications. Also, the cloud service providers are also challenging in terms of cost reduction and energy consumption reductions for better manageability of the data center without degrading the performance of the deployed applications. It is to be noted that the performance of the application does not only depend on the responsiveness of the applications rather also must be measured in terms of service level agreements. The violation of the service level agreements or SLA can easily disprove the purpose of application deployments on cloud-based data centers. Thus, the data center owners apply multiple load balancing strategies for maintaining the desired outcomes from the application owners at the minimized cost of data center maintainability. Hence, the demand of the research is to thoroughly study and identify the scopes for improvements in the parallel research outcomes. As the number of applications ranging from small data-centric applications coming with the demand of frequent updates with higher computational capabilities to the big data-centric application as big data analytics applications coming with efficient algorithms for data and computation load managements, the data center owners are forced to think for efficient algorithms for load managements. The algorithms presented by various research attempts have engrossed on application specific demands for load balancing using virtual machine migrations and the solution as the proposed algorithms have become application problem specific. Henceforth, the further demand of the research is a guideline for selecting the appropriate load balancing algorithm via virtual machine migration for characteristics-based specific applications. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive survey on existing virtual machine migration and selection processes to understand the specific application-oriented capabilities of these strategies with the advantages and bottlenecks. Also, with the understanding of the existing measures for load balancing, it is also important to furnish the further improvement strategies, which can be made possible with a detailed understanding of the parallel research outcomes. Henceforth, this paper also equips the study with guidelines for improvements and for further study. Nonetheless, the study cannot be completed without the mathematical analysis for better understanding and experimental analysis on different standards of datasets for better conclusive decisions. Hence, this paper also presents the discussion on mathematical models and experimental result analysis for the conclusive decision on the improvement factors and the usability of the migration methods for various purposes. Finally, this paper is a comprehensive survey on the background of the research, recent research outcomes using mathematical modeling and experimental studies on various available datasets, and finally identify the scopes of improvements considering various aspects such as execution time, mean time before a VM migration, mean time before a host shutdown, number of node shutdowns, SLA performance degradation, VM migrations, and energy consumption.

AB  - The computing world is rapidly evolving and advancing, with new ground-breaking technologies emerging. Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning have opened up new possibilities, providing unprecedented computational power and problem-solving capabilities while offering a deeper understanding of complex systems. Our research proposes new variational methods based on a deep learning system based on an optical quantum neural network applied to Machine Learning models for point classification. As a case study, we considered the binary classification of points belonging to a certain geometric pattern (the Two-Moons Classification problem) on a plane. We think it is reasonable to expect benefits from using hybrid deep learning systems (classical + quantum), not just in terms of accelerating computation but also in understanding the underlying phenomena and mechanisms. This will result in the development of new machine-learning paradigms and a significant advancement in the field of quantum computation. The selected dataset is a set of 2D points creating two interleaved semicircles and is based on a 2D binary classification generator, which aids in evaluating the performance of particular methods. The two coordinates of each unique point,  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , serve as the features since they present two disparate data sets in a two-dimensional representation space. The goal was to create a quantum deep neural network that could recognise and categorise points accurately with the fewest trainable parameters possible.

AB  - Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because of the wide swaths of unused and unexplored spectrum. These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed. This paper offers the first in-depth look at the vast applications of THz wireless products and applications and provides approaches for how to reduce power and increase performance across several problem domains, giving early evidence that THz techniques are compelling and available for future wireless communications.

AB  - Allocating roles and functions between the human and computer is critical in defining efficient and effective system architectures. However, past methodologies for balancing the roles and functionalities between humans and computers in complex systems have little connection to different types of required cognition, behaviors, or tasks, or don't address the role of uncertainty in the environment. To augment these previous role allocation approaches, this article presents a modification to the skill, rule, and knowledge-based behavior taxonomy that includes expertise and uncertainty. Skill-based behaviors are the best candidates for automation, assuming significant sensor performance assumptions can be met, but rule and knowledge-based reasoning are better suited for human-computer collaboration. Such systems should be designed so that humans harness the raw computational and search power of computers for state-space reduction, but also allow them the latitude to apply their expertise in uncertain situations through inductive reasoning for potentially creative, out-of-the-box thinking.

AB  - Very recently, intensive discussions and studies on Industry 5.0 have sprung up and caused the attention of researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers from various sectors around the world. However, there is no consensus on why and what is Industry 5.0 yet. In this paper, we define Industry 5.0 from its philosophical and historical origin and evolution, emphasize its new thinking on virtual-real duality and human-machine interaction, and introduce its new theory and technology based on parallel intelligence (PI), artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (the ACP method), and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). Case studies and applications of Industry 5.0 over the last decade have been briefly summarized and analyzed with suggestions for its future development. We believe that Industry 5.0 of virtual-real interactive parallel industries has great potentials and is critical for building smart societies. Steps are outlined to ensure a roadmap that would lead to a smooth transition from CPS-based Industry 4.0 to CPSS-based Industry 5.0 for a better world which is Safe in physical spaces, Secure in cyberspaces, Sustainable in ecology, Sensitive in indi-vidual privacy and rights, Service for all, and Smartness of all.

AB  - As computational thinking becomes increasingly important for children to learn, we must develop interfaces that leverage the ways that young children learn to provide opportunities for them to develop these skills. Active Learning Environments with Robotic Tangibles (ALERT) and Robopad, an analogous on-screen virtual spatial programming environment for educational Human Robot Interaction (HRI), have been developed. Evaluations of these in the context of free play and open-ended learning activities show that both systems afford opportunities for young children to engage in spatial programming, creating improvisational and sequential programs that mediate interactions between the environment, robots, and humans in responsive and creative ways. These systems demonstrate innovative opportunities for advancing mixed reality spatial programming activities as a form of HRI that fosters engaging seamless cyberlearning experiences, across formal and informal environments.

AB  - Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human, promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners-In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal.

Arduino arises from current technological innovations with the intention of promoting a new approach to learning through machines. The objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of the Arduino concept in the scientific literature. To achieve this aim, a bibliometric methodology based on scientific mapping and an analysis of co-words has been used. The scientific production of Arduino indexed in Web of Science has been analyzed. We have worked with an analysis unit of 346 documents. The results of this research show that the scientific production on Arduino in the field of education starts in 2010 until today. The communications in the congresses to present the results of the investigations developed are the most used means of diffusion. The National University of Distance Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu are particularly noteworthy. The authors with more scientific production in this field of study are Bogdan, M. and Castro, M. It is significant that the collection of studies on this subject is carried out, above all, by EDULEARN Proceedings and INTED Proceedings. It can be concluded that the field of study on Arduino in the educational field is relatively recent, so that today, the basis for scientific research is still being established. However, the most relevant aspects in this field of study are physic experiments, computational thinking and computer-based learning.

AB  - Millions of people around the world are affected by one or more mental disorders that interfere in their thinking and behavior. A timely detection of these issues is challenging but crucial, since it could open the possibility to offer help to people before the illness gets worse. One alternative to accomplish this is to monitor how people express themselves, that is for example what and how they write, or even a step further, what emotions they express in their social media communications. In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia. The obtained results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions, captured by the proposed representations, allow to highlight important information about social media users suffering from depression or anorexia. Furthermore, the fusion of both representations can boost the performance, equalling the best reported approach for depression and barely behind the top performer for anorexia by only 1 percent. Moreover, these representations open the possibility to add some interpretability to the results.

AB  - Scratch Day is made up of a global network of events. Its main goal is to bring people together to celebrate Scratch. Scratch is a free encryption platform that can be used online and offline for children. Scratch Day events bring together young people from the Scratch community. During these meetings, attendees share projects, learn from each other and welcome newcomers. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots are becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences. Throughout this work the importance of combining theory and practice is shown in order to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most popular technologies that have emerged in recent years, and its reputation comes from its importance and its real role in changing things for the better, we started from smartphones that opened a new perspective for the technical world around us, and later came cloud computing with new thinking and mindset about the use of computational powers. The tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning are then shown and a new horizon of computing power and capabilities is spreading, and recently with the advent of the IoT we may see a different technological future, the IoT has changed technical realities and created a real need to redefine computing. Its wide spread created many intelligent environments, such as smart homes and smart cities, that facilitate the life around us. Although it leads to significant development, there are still doubts about the security concepts in IoT-based systems. In this paper, a design of IoT architecture is proposed, and it displays the security challenges, issues, and requirements of the smart home/cities security, it discusses security attacks in IoT systems, then the security countermeasures that can be followed and takes on a real-life scenario on an IoT-based environment.

AB  - Advances in wireless technology have resulted in pervasive deployment of devices of a high variability in form factors, memory and computational ability. The need for maintaining continuous connections that deliver data with high reliability necessitate re-thinking of conventional design of the transport layer protocol. This paper investigates the use of Q-learning in TCP cwnd adaptation during the congestion avoidance state, wherein the classical alternation of the window is replaced, thereby allowing the protocol to immediately respond to previously seen network conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how memory plays a critical role in building the exploration space, and proposes ways to reduce this overhead through function approximation. The superior performance of the learning-based approach over TCP New Reno is demonstrated through a comprehensive simulation study, revealing 33.8% and 12.1% improvement in throughput and delay, respectively, for the evaluated topologies. We also show how function approximation can be used to dramatically reduce the memory requirements of a learning-based protocol while maintaining the same throughput and delay.

AB  - Although mutation analysis is considered the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite, hefty computational cost often limits its use. To address this problem, various mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking to reduce the number of mutants while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive mutation analysis. While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit.

AB  - Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, educational robotics tools emerge with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This demonstrator focuses on driving the same content through three low-cost robotic educational tools. The first is Scratch, where you can schedule interactive stories, games and animations. The second tool is Crumble, an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that facilitates its use. Finally, Arduino is an open source, hardware- and software-based platform that is easy to use and has great potential for developing robotic applications. This demonstrator aims to present the above platforms as educational robotics tools as the first step into the world of robotics. Throughout this demonstrator an introduction to educational robotics is developed.

AB  - There is a strong worldwide movement which is pushing for the teaching of serious computer science principles besides reading, writing and basic numeracy starting from first grade and reaching all students across all grades. This is being done through both formal initiatives carried out by international organizations and at the national level by putting forward curricula, some of which are mandatory. In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities. Recent reports have pointed out the need for supporting the international community of teachers by providing assessment methods, an internationally validated question repository as well as tools and assessment platforms. In this context our work presents an assessment platform for formative, summative and informal assessment of computer science competencies by using a visual language, namely App Inventor, which allows for the rapid development of a mobile app and has a strong appeal to the younger generation of students. The capability to log user activity allows the teacher to monitor the progression in the student's learning path as well as her/his solution-building approach.

AB  - Current desktop-GIS software cannot answer users' spatial questions directly. The GIS functionality is hard to identify and use without specific training of GIS skills because of the complex hierarchical organization and the gap between users' spatial thinking and systems' implement descriptions. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for designing a question-based user interface that integrates different levels of ontologies (spatial concept ontology, domain ontology and task ontology) to guide the process of extracting the core spatial concepts and translating them into a set of equivalent computational or operational GIS tasks. We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services. The semantic framework would be useful to enhance the ability of spatial reasoning in web search engines (e.g. Google semantic search) and answering questions in location-based services as well (e.g. iPhone Siri assistant).

AB  - Supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE) protocol delivers promising public and secret key sizes over other post-quantum candidates. However, the huge computations form the bottleneck and limit its practical applications. The modular multiplication operation, which is one of the most computationally demanding operations in the fundamental arithmetics, takes up a large part of the computations in the protocol. In this paper, we propose an improved unconventional-radix finite-field multiplication (IFFM) algorithm which reduces the computational complexity by about 20% compared to previous algorithms. We then devise a new high-speed modular multiplier architecture based on the IFFM. It is shown that the proposed architecture can be extensively pipelined to achieve a very high clock speed due to its complete feedforward scheme, which demonstrates significant advantages over conventional designs. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multiplier has about 67 times faster throughput than the state-of-the-art designs and more than 12 times better area efficiency than previous works. Therefore, we think that these achievements will greatly contribute to the practicability of this protocol.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It has been proposed that this disorder is related to disrupted brain connectivity, which has been verified by many studies. With the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), further exploration of brain connectivity was made possible. Region-based networks are commonly used for mapping brain connectivity. However, they fail to illustrate the connectivity within regions of interest (ROIs) and lose precise location information. Voxel-based networks provide higher precision, but are difficult to construct and interpret due to the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we adopt a novel high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model – $\psi$-learning method, which can help ease computational burden and provide more accurate inference for the underlying networks. This method has been proven to be an equivalent measure of the partial correlation coefficient and, thus, is flexible for network comparison through statistical tests. The fMRI data we used were collected by the mind clinical imaging consortium using an auditory task in which there are 92 SZ patients and 116 healthy controls. We compared the networks at three different scales by using global measurements, community structure, and edge-wise comparisons within the networks. Our results reveal, at the highest voxel resolution, sets of distinct aberrant patterns for the SZ patients, and more precise local structures are provided within ROIs for further investigation.

AB  - Logo turtles and Henderson's picture language have long been used to teach computational thinking by inspiring learners to construct programs that create complex geometric designs. We have developed visual blocks-based versions of these languages, TurtleBlocks and PictureBlocks, that allow users to transform their designs into tangible artifacts produced by laser cutters and vinyl cutters. Our languages embody two novel features. First, they use constructive area geometry to convert the geometric designs generated by our programs into formats suitable for laser and vinyl cutters. Second, they leverage static typing and polymorphism to provide a new way to reference the names of procedure parameters and local variables in a blocks language.

AB  - Active Methodologies allow an active process in teaching and learning contents, promote responsible student involvement and bring satisfaction and enrichment to educational practices and active learning. Generally, students have learning difficulties in Computer Science courses, as they need to develop computational skills and thinking. The goals of this article is to characterize and analyze the types of Active Methodologies that are being applied in teaching and learning activities in Computer Science. Thus, this investigation was carried out through a Systematic Mapping Study, focusing on the use of the types of methodologies in view of the results achieved. It presents students’ perceptions, benefits, and difficulties in adopting these methodologies in the classroom. The results show 6 types of different Active Methodologies used in 35 publications selected, different types of techniques or studies that were used, the publications trend per year, the courses that were worked in analyzed publications, and some benefits and difficulty related to the adoption of Active Methodologies. Regarding to students’ perception, we identified different type feelings. Thus, the contributions of this study consist in a research focused on the use of Active Methodologies in a very broad sense, including the perceptions of teachers and students regarding the use of different teaching and learning methodologies. In addition, it shows the specific benefits and possible difficulties experienced in the use of Active Methodologies as teaching strategies. Consequently, some findings from this study may have the potential to support or direct choices of these methodologies in different Computer Science courses.

AB  - In a world with intensive computational services and require optimal solutions, cloud security is a critical concern. As a known fact, the cloud is a diverse field in which data is crucial, and as a result, it invites the dark world to enter and create a virtual menace to businesses, governments, and technology that is facilitated by the cloud. This article addresses the fundamentals of cloud computing, as well as security and threats in various applications. This research study will explore how security is remaining as a potential risk for cloud users across the globe by listing some of the cloud applications. Some viable solutions and security measures that could help us in analyzing cloud security threats are reviewed. The analyzed solutions include profound analytical thinking on how to render the solutions more impactful in each scenario. Several cloud security solutions are available to assist businesses in reducing costs and enhancing security. This study discover that if the risks are taken into consideration without any delay then the matter of solutions gets divided into four pillars, which will assist us in obtaining a more comprehensive knowledge. Visibility, compute-based security, network protection, and lastly identity security are referred as four pillars.

AB  - The pedagogy of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) can be easily developed by using robotics and computational thinking tools. Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses. This paper describes a course focused on a combination of teaching methodologies, educational robotics tools, and a student learning management methodology, all within an inclusive framework to strengthen the presence of women and other under-represented groups in engineering.

AB  - The computational demands of multimedia data processing are steadily increasing as consumers call for progressively more complex and intelligent multimedia services. New multi-core hardware architectures provide the required resources, but writing parallel, distributed applications remains a labor-intensive task compared to their sequential counter-part. For this reason, Google and Microsoft implemented their respective processing frameworks MapReduce and Dryad, as they allow the developer to think sequentially, yet benefit from parallel and distributed execution. An inherent limitation in the design of these batch processing frameworks is their inability to express arbitrarily complex workloads. The dependency graphs of the frameworks are often limited to directed acyclic graphs, or even pre-determined stages. This is particularly problematic for video encoding and other algorithms that depend on iterative execution. With the Nornir runtime system for parallel programs, which is a Kahn Process Network implementation, we addressed and solved several of these limitations. However, it is more difficult to use than other frameworks due to its complex programming model. In this paper, we build on the knowledge gained from Nornir and present a new framework, called P2G, designed specifically for developing and processing distributed real-time multimedia data. P2G supports arbitrarily complex dependency graphs with cycles, branches and deadlines, and provides both data- and task-parallelism. The framework is implemented to scale transparently with available (heterogeneous) resources, a concept familiar from the cloud computing paradigm. We have implemented an (interchangeable) P2G kernel language to ease development. In this paper, we present a proof of concept implementation of a P2G execution node and some experimental examples using complex workloads like Motion JPEG and K-means clustering. The results show that the P2G system is a feasible approach to multimedia processing.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence technologies are progressing into fields that were formerly believed to be still the domain of domain analysts. Thanks to recent advances in digital form of information processing, artificial learning, and computational resources, which helped personnel involved in healthcare services in various domains. In certain cases, AI and NLP can handle healthcare functions even well than individuals. One of the area in which machine learning along with natural language processing can work is psychological diseases. Anomalous thinking, emotions, and actions are characteristics of mental illnesses. Aberrant inner interactions and actions that defy social expectations could indicate the existence of a cognitive disease. This research paper proposes a cognitive disease prediction model for psychological disorders like, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. In the mainstream medical industry, providing cognitive health treatment entails new ways to treat individuals with mental illnesses. Proposed e-healthcare systems provide an extra layer which helps healthcare professional and patients by saving their time in early diagnosis.

AB  - Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.

AB  - Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.

AB  - Computational and data-intensive science increasingly depends on a large Web Service infrastructure, as services that provide a broad array of functionality can be composed into workflows to address complex research questions. In this context, the goal of service registries is to offer accurate search and discovery functions to scientists. Their effectiveness, however, depends not only on the model chosen to annotate the services, but also on the level of abstraction chosen for the annotations. The work presented in this paper stems from the observation that current annotation models force users to think in terms of service interfaces, rather than of high-level functionality, thus reducing their effectiveness. To alleviate this problem,we introduce Functional Units (FU) as the elementary units of information used to describe a service. Using popular examples of services for the Life Sciences, we define FUs as configurations and compositions of underlying service operations, and show how functional-style service annotations can be easily realised using the OWL semantic Web language. Finally, we suggest techniques for automating the service annotations process, by analysing collections of workflows that use those services.

AB  - The idea behind this work is to start exploring the application of data analytics and (explainable) machine learning techniques to better understand games and discover new features that will possibly help in effectively exploiting them in different socially useful domains. We prove the feasibility of the idea by: (i) collecting a large dataset of board game information; (ii) designing and testing an information processing pipeline for automatically discovering game categories and game mechanics, with some first encouraging results. In the future, we plan to further generalize this approach for different kinds of games and for discovering currently unknown but useful aspects, e.g. games or game features that could better foster Computational Thinking in education, those better suited to be applied in social distancing contexts, and so on.

AB  - Whilst there has been growing interest in the use of social robots in educational settings, the majority of this research focuses on learning outcomes, with less emphasis on the social processes surrounding these interactions. One such understudied factor is children’s trust in the robot as a teacher. Trust is a relevant domain in that if and how children trust a robot could influence their subsequent learning outcomes. The extent to which the robot’s behaviour (including making errors) influences trust is yet to be fully explored. Consequently, the goal of this research is to determine the role of trust in children’s learning from social robots. We report a pilot study investigating the conceptualisation and measurement of chil-dren’s trust in robots. 33 children aged between 4-9 completed a computational thinking learning task with a NAO robot at a Science Festival. Observations of the interactions in terms of developing tasks and measurements for child robot interaction are discussed. The findings tentatively suggest children’s trust in the robot can be divided into two parts: social affiliation towards the robot, and perceived competence/reliability of the robot.

AB  - Mobility-on-demand systems are transforming the way we think about the transportation of people and goods. Most research effort has been placed on scalability issues for systems with a large number of agents and simple pickup/drop-off demands. In this paper, we consider fair multi-vehicle route planning with streams of complex, temporal logic transportation demands. We consider an approximately envy-free fair allocation of demands to limited-capacity vehicles based on agents' accumulated utility over a finite time horizon, representing for example monetary reward or utilization level. We propose a scalable approach based on the construction of assignment graphs that relate agents to routes and demands, and pose the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Routes for assignments are computed using automata-based methods for each vehicle and demands sets of size at most the capacity of the vehicle while taking into account their pickup wait time and delay tolerances. In addition, we integrate utility-based weights in the assignment graph and ILP to ensure approximative fair allocation. We demonstrate the computational and operational performance of our methods in ride-sharing case studies over a large environment in mid-Manhattan and Linear Temporal Logic demands with stochastic arrival times. We show that our method significantly decreases the utility deviation between agents and the vacancy rate.

Additionally, this research elucidates the approaches that various robotics may take and the difficulties they may encounter. Robotics is a branch of science that studies the interaction of thought patterns. To make the connection intelligent, Artificial Intelligence must play a significant role. Artificial Intelligence is concerned with the critical questions of what data is required for each aspect of thinking, how that knowledge should be represented, and how that knowledge should be used. Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics advancements will have a significant impact on humanity's future in the near future. Artificial intelligence is commonly used to refer to any artificial computational framework that exhibits perceptive behavior, i.e., complex behavior that assists in achieving goals.

Such tools allows the user to program while manipulating blocks that represent programming languages instructions. iVProg is among this class of tools and was firstly implemented in Java and could be integrated to Moodle using iAssign. Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle. In addition, we give some teaching support whenever integrated using iVProgH with Moodle using iAssign.

AB  - Machine-learning algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in embedded sensing applications, by enabling the analysis of signals derived from physically complex processes. Given the severe resource constraints faced in such applications (energy, functional capacity, reliability, etc.), there is the need to think about how the algorithms can be implemented with very high efficiency. This paper examines the opportunities on three levels: (1) inherent resilience against computational errors, enabling some degree of fault tolerance; (2) top-down training of statistical models using data explicitly affected by errors, enabling substantial fault tolerance; and (3) bottom-up specification of inference kernels based on preferred hardware implementation, enabling reduced hardware complexity. Implementations employing the last two approaches are proposed and evaluated through hardware measurements and simulation.

AB  - What other people think" has always been makes us curious while indulge in decision making process. Earlier, many of us asked our personal acquaintances to recommend a political candidate or political party to whom we can vote or consult a broker to decide in which share we should invest our money. With the invent of Internet and world wide web have now let it happen to find out large pool of online users to share recommendation, opinion, views about an event. Although these online users are never our personal acquaintance nor professional critics. An irony of situation is many people are sharing opinions available to completely unknown person via Internet. In the beginning of 21st century, social networking websites taken exponential growth in popularity among online users by providing them a platform for discussion and exchange information. Apart from posting photos and videos for event, now online users are posting their comments, views, opinion about event.

AB  - Programming skills and computational thinking are fundamental concerns in professional training in Science, Technology' Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In spite of this, in the Chilean higher education system, as in most parts of the world, teaching programming is a challenging endeavor, partly because the majority of freshmen students in STEM undergraduate programs have not been introduced to the fundamentals of the discipline and its applications in K12 education. Therefore, students' attitudes, engagement, and autonomous learning can make a difference in how students in STEM disciplines in higher education face their first programming course. In the present study, we carried out measurement of variables associated to these constructs involving a sample of 1694 freshmen of seventeen STEM programs in a Chilean research university. Relevant differences were found among different STEM programs, and by student gender. Implications of the results obtained and future research avenues are discussed.

AB  - Scratch is a popular programming platform with plenty of learning resources. However, it is quite difficult for users to find suitable resources. In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset.

AB  - This paper investigates the skills needed by Higher Education (HE) students to become successful Internet of Things (IoT) future leaders/developers. The paper focuses on the programming and Maths aspects, being fundamental to IoT development, in addition to computational thinking and coding concepts for the HE students. The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.

AB  - Plagiarism is known as an unauthorized use of other's contents in writing and ideas in thinking without proper acknowledgment. There are several tools implemented for text-based plagiarism detection using various methods and techniques. However, these tools become inefficient while handling a large number of datasets due to the process of plagiarism detection which comprises of a lot of computational tasks and large memory requirement. Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU. Thus, introducing GPU based optimization algorithm to the plagiarism detection gives a real solution while handling a large number of data for inter-document plagiarism detection.

AB  - Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) capacitate a myriad of possibilities and creativity. Therefore, while teaching evolutionary programming to students of Computer Science, we decided to equip them with the technical details and then let them explore the creative aspects themselves. As part of the introductory course on Artificial Intelligence, an evolutionary generation of art is an assignment The teaching goals were to inform students of creative aspects of EA as well as invoke critical thinking and analysis in them. The students generated images via EA, and the only restriction was on the pixel size for input. The assignment was well-received, despite its complexity. Students engaged with the art generation and felt confident in expressing their perspectives of creativity and art The assignment evaluation as a contest allowed for judges from diverse domains such as Computer scientists and artists. The goals of the course are met as the students were trained not only in technical details but also realized the capacity and generative power of algorithms, as they practically simulated and expressed their creative thoughts via this contest Furthermore, the students engaged with the philosophical foundations of computational creativity effectively by the design process, and a report completed along with the work required them to develop their own artistic exegesis of the algorithm.

AB  - Buffer overflow is one of the most dangerous and common vulnerabilities in CPS software. Despite static and dynamic analysis, manual analysis is still heavily used which is useful but costly. Human computation harness humans' time and energy in a way of playing games to solve computational problems. In this paper we propose a human computation method to detect buffer overflows that does not ask a person whether there is a potential vulnerability, but rather a random person's idea. We implement this method as a game called Bodhi in which each player is shown a piece of code snippet and asked to choose whether their partner would think there is a buffer overflow vulnerability at a given position in the code. The purpose of the game is to make use of the rich distributed human resource to increase effectiveness of manual detection for buffer overflows. The game has been proven to be efficient and enjoyable in practice.

AB  - Machine learning is a new paradigm of problem solving. Teaching machine learning in schools and colleges to prepare the industry's needs becomes imminent, not only in computing majors, but also in all engineering disciplines. This paper develops a new, hands-on approach to teaching machine learning by training a linear classifier and applying that classifier to solve Multirotor Activity Recognition (MAR) problems in an online lab setting. MAR labs leverage cloud computing and data storage technologies to host a versatile environment capable of logging, orchestrating, and visualizing the solution for an MAR problem through a user interface. This work extends Arizona State University's Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment (VIPLE) as a control platform for multi-rotors used in data collection. VIPLE is a platform developed for teaching computational thinking, visual programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics application development.

AB  - Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.

AB  - Most countries in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) have adopted national development plans that recognize ICT as the main driver for economic development. For ICT to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ICT literate. As a result, a number of countries have developed Subject Policy Guidelines aimed at introducing Computer Studies at Secondary School level. While most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ICT infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. Subsequently, most African student's first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the Computer Science major without any prior hands-on experience. The Namibian Technology Outreach to Secondary Schools (NAMTOSS) initiative is a pilot program started by the School of Computing (SoC) at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in March 2016. NAMTOSS is a partnership between secondary school teachers, learners and the staff members of the School of Computing at UNAM that is designed to introduce computer programming skills and computational thinking at secondary school level. NAMTOSS attempts to address the structural and systemic issues raised by previously unsuccessful outreach efforts conducted in Southern Africa. In this paper, we enumerate the successes and failures of our initial outreach efforts and suggest several enhancements to our program that we feel will lead to its success.

AB  - As the number of teachers teaching computer science grows, it is increasingly important to be mindful of the training they receive with respect to broadening participation in computer science. Through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS A. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled “Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education” that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course.

AB  - The last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to Computer Science (CS) education, especially for K-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in CS and Computational Thinking (CT). Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. We describe a detailed AI/ML lesson plan based on standards and framework, AI4K12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to $\boldsymbol{4}^{\mathbf{th}}$ grade students in an elementary school.

AB  - Why do people think Tom Hanks and Juliette Lewis look alike? Can we modify the gender appearance of a face image without changing its identity information? Is there any specific feature responsible for the perception of femininity/masculinity in a given face image? Those questions are appealing from both computer vision and visual perception perspectives. To shed light upon them, we propose to develop a GAN based approach toward face gender transfer and study the relevance of learned feature representations to face gender perception. Our key contributions include: 1) an architecture design with specially tailored loss functions in the feature space for face gender transfer; 2) the introduction of a novel probabilistic gender mask to facilitate achieving both the objectives of gender transfer and identity preservation; and 3) identification of sparse features (≈ 20 out of 256) uniquely responsible for face gender perception. Extensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate not only the superiority of the proposed face gender transfer technique (in terms of visual quality of reconstructed images) but also the effectiveness of gender feature representation learning (in terms of the high correlation between the learned sparse features and the perceived gender information). Our findings seem to corroborate a hypothesis about the independence between face recognizability and gender classifiability in the literature of psychology. We expect this work will stimulate more computational studies of different face perception attributes including race, age, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.

AB  - Blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed system meant for secure computation and information sharing platform free from any central authority that enables multiple authoritative domain which do not trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in rational decision-making process. Bitcoin is pioneer crypto currency platform that uses blockchain technology but over the time it has moved beyond Bitcoin and has successfully bypassed to other application domain. Beside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger and Corda, Quorum have emerged as a successful distributive computing platform. Major consortium like Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Hyperledger and R3 are formed with aim to come up with business solution. Today we have different blockchain application in public sector, finance, supply-chain, healthcare and IoT. In many industries people think blockchain will be transformative. Financial sector is most enthusiastic in adopting blockchain followed by supply chain management. Blockchain is closely looked at in India too. In 2018 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a white paper in order to identify the potential application areas of blockchain in Indian banking. NITI Aayog is working on national strategy for blockchain which will identify the area where country can implement blockchain.

AB  - Digitization is becoming part of almost everyone’s life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. This has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. Our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers.

AB  - Computational thinking is an important part of a modern education, and robotics provides a powerful tool for teaching programming logic in an interactive and engaging way. The robot garden presented in this paper is a distributed multi-robot system capable of running autonomously or under user control from a simple graphical interface. Over 100 origami flowers are actuated with LEDs and printed pouch motors, and are deployed in a modular array around additional swimming and crawling folded robots. The garden integrates state-of-the-art rapid design and fabrication technologies with distributed systems software techniques to create a scalable swarm in which robots can be controlled individually or as a group. The garden can be used to teach basic algorithmic concepts through its distributed algorithm demonstration capabilities and can teach programming concepts through its education-oriented user interface.

AB  - This paper introduces compact swarm intelligence. It presents a new estimation of distribution algorithm based on the swarm behavior of fireflies. The proposed algorithm is called the compact firefly optimizer (cFO). It uses a compact representation to store the population of the fireflies. Thus, the whole population is represented by a probabilistic distribution function. The compact swarm intelligence proposed allows the reduction of the computational capacity required to evolve the population toward the optimal solution. An important numerical test is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained show that the proposed compact firefly optimizer (cFO) is very competitive. Furthermore, the new concepts of compact swarm robotics are also introduced. The algorithm is applied to describe the first compact swarm robotics system. The objective is to realize an optimal stable walking by bipedal robot. Discussions, propositions and analysis let to think to a new important starting point for an emerging field of compact swarm intelligence, robotics, search and optimization.

AB  - This paper presents a serious game that has been developed for programmers aiming to analyze and examine the effectiveness and the perceived usability of two different game interfaces. This game presents a drag-and-drop interface and a classical typing interface and towards this approach, four different versions of the same game were developed. Each version of the game focuses on either creating a part of code or debugging (finding the errors in the code provided). The game enables the players to advance their programming skills and computational thinking by engaging them in problem-solving activities during the gameplay. This paper provides insight and focuses on the evaluation of different interfaces in a serious game that is developed for programmers and targets fundamental programming concepts.

AB  - Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.

AB  - Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is a computational thinking methodology where roles provide an underlying mechanism to facilitate abstraction, classification, separation of concerns, dynamics, and interactions. From a meta theoretical perspective, the specification of groups, roles and agents is a critical element of RBC. In consideration of the relationships and hierarchies faced by groups, roles and agents, we propose a minimal role playing logic system (MRPL) through substructural logic, which is polynomial in complexity, in support of RBC. From MRPL and RPLs extending from it, there are three levels of application, i.e., the global level governing how people organize agents to form a group; the concatenative level for role assignment with respect to logic and algebra, and the operational level governing properties, relations and structures that should appear in collaborative system design. From MRPL to RPLs, one can extend it to suit other appropriate applications.

AB  - Embodied interaction concerns the way that user senses the environment, acquires information, and exhibits intention by means of physical action. In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spatio-navigational type of problems.

AB  - The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).

AB  - With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveSMART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition.

AB  - In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design.

AB  - Frequently, the existing resources in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), used in distance education courses and blended, are presented in the same way for all students. This may complicate the effective learning process of each student. In order to solve this problem, one of the original goals of intelligent educational systems is to guide every student to the most appropriate educational contents. So, the approach adopted in this paper is based on a framework called ArCARE (Conceptual Framework of Educational Resources Adaptation in Virtual Learning Environments), which allows adaptation of resources for students in VLEs, allowing the construction of their knowledge, using multi-agent system technology that handles an open learner model ontology. These ArCARE resources are recommendation and adaptation of collaborative activities such as Pedagogical Architectures for the students have a more effective learning of particular course content. Results obtained from some tests in a flexible curriculum course of Computational Thinking show the feasibility of the proposal.

AB  - This research explored the degree of learning self-efficacy of machine learning experience (MLSE) and artificial intelligence learning anxiety (AILA) of elementary and junior high school teachers. The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.

AB  - In recent years, industries have been moving with tremendous speed towards "green thinking" as never before. Proceeding into a more circular economy will offer benefits such as reducing environmental burdens, enhancing the protection of raw material supply, increasing competition, promoting productivity, boosting sustainable economic growth and creating employment. Remanufacturing leads to circularity, while reverse supply chains pose difficulties. Closed loop supply chains are prioritized for reverse supply chain networks. However, alternative supply chains and different market actors make remanufacturing possible through open loops. In this study, a new integrated mathematical approach is proposed to address designing a multi-stage, multi-product and multi-period open loop reverse supply chain network which maximizes the profit and utilizes reverse logistics to benefit the environment in the most efficient way. The proposed approach presents a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) that uses water treatment facility along with the common components of open loop reverse supply chain (OLSC). The objective determines the facility location and material flows between stages in each period. Using a realistic network instance, computational results are used to verify the feasibility of the study.

AB  - We address two fundamental issues in the computational theory of mind (CTM): the extreme accuracy of visual signal perception and the quick recall of relevant information from a vast memory. The key component of our approach is an algorithm that converts the spatial signal into a temporal representation. The model is motivated by human vision, but it is valid for concept abstraction and analogical thinking in general.

AB  - A Virtual Reality (VR) ambiance can simulate real-world scenarios and problems, allowing students to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations. The design of the VR ambiance should align with the learning objectives and provide relevant challenges and tasks that require students to use their computer technology skills to solve problems. A well-designed VR ambiance can encourage exploration and creativity in computer technology students. By providing a virtual space that allows experimentation and innovation, students can explore different approaches, test ideas, and think creatively when solving problems. This paper studies how students and professors evaluated the development of competencies during an extracurricular project for the development of a virtual interactive environment for learning a process. Designing an interactive virtual environment will require the implementation of various interactive elements, such as 3D objects, user interfaces, and animations. Students can apply their programming skills to create the necessary functionality in the virtual environment. To create an attractive and easy-to-use virtual environment, students will need to consider UX design principles. In this case, the competencies to be measured were: Solving problems generating efficient computational algorithms under models and tools of computer science and developing software applying process and quality standards of Software Engineering. To assess compliance with the development of competencies, it was decided to develop an interactive virtual environment; this is a process that involves several stages, from conceptualization to implementation and testing. The objectives of the virtual environment were established. In this case, it was decided to develop an environment that would help the user learn how to change a flat tire. A plan was created detailing how users will interact with the virtual environment. Early results show that more than 50% of the students outstandingly developed problem-solving competence, additionally, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed the competence in a more than acceptable way would go up to 93%. These results, also show that more than 70% of the students outstandingly developed software development competence. In addition, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed competence in a more than acceptable way would rise to 92%.

AB  - Programming has been part of Swedish elementary school curriculum for six years and the aim of this full paper is to find out how teachers can design programming activities so that students engage and learn. A mix-methods research project with a social semiotic, multimodal theoretical framework – Designs for learning – is used to investigate teaching and learning in a class during three years. The results in this small-scale study indicate that collaboration is a successful didactic design for programming lessons in school. Computational thinking is prevalent and both digital skills (such as coding) and digital competencies (such as understanding the impact of technology in society) are practiced and met in programming lessons merging Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics.

AB  - The climate of the planet is going through some mayor changes. Most of the climate scientists agree upon anthropological activities being the main cause of this, due to the CO2 and other GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Road transportation also contributes to air pollution and to the local pollution in big cities, due to the emissions of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and polluting gases such as NOx, CO, SO2 among others. Those problems and the continuous increase in emission limits given by regulators all over the world, are demanding for a change in the current transportation paradigm, leading to a completely electrified solution for both the private and public vehicles. This is particularly true for those cities that relay thoroughly on bus system as main public form of transport. Even though the Colombian capital, Bogota, is a big city with about 10 million people, it does not have a subway or other electric type of massive transport systems, but it has developed a big and articulated bus system. With the aim of shifting part of this system, namely the trunk lines of the Transmilenio company, to an electric one, this work analyses the problematic of the charging needs. To calculate the energy consumptions, computational simulations on two lines, C29 and B11, have been performed based on three different solutions proposed to address the charging problem. The aim of this work is the comparison of different technical solutions to find the best one in financial terms (also in the form of type and dimension of the bus accumulators in a true first principles thinking) and the estimation and inclusion of the buses’ cost.

This chapter begins a discussion of the kinds of resources that might be available to overcome the current limitations. A main focus of this chapter is on the idea that cognition does not flow in only one direction. What we perceive and what we think is affected by context and by expectations. The chapter continues with a discussion of how language is both a problem for intelligence and a contributor to intelligence, and it concludes with a discussion of common sense.

Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.

AB  - Scientific and technological progress has promoted social change, and digital technologies such as big data, the Internet, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things have begun to develop, changing human thinking structure, living habits, learning behaviors, communication methods, and production technologies. Big data, as a hot topic in current digital technology and digital development, is based on massive data and generates value through computational analysis. It has been applied in various fields and different scenarios. China has issued the “Overall Layout Plan for Digital China Construction” document, which clarifies the need to accelerate the construction of Digital China, promote digital technology innovation, improve the digital governance system, and enhance digital security capabilities. The digital reform and development of education is an important part of the construction of a digital China, and it is an inevitable path to achieve the modernization of China's education. The development of digital education requires innovative digital applications in teaching methods, teaching resources, teaching evaluation, educational governance, and actively promoting the application of digital technologies such as big data and cloud computing in specific educational scenarios. The performance management of university teachers, as one of the important contents of educational governance and university management, relies on big data to establish a data governance system for the performance management of university teachers, which is precisely the demand for the digital development and construction of education. This article explores the application of big data in the digital construction of performance management for university teachers from three aspects: background, definition and characteristics of big data, and digitalization of performance management for university teachers. With big data as the core and data governance as the goal, big data application design is carried out from three perspectives: improving the digital performance system for university teachers, digitizing the performance content of university teachers, and designing a big data platform for university teacher performance management.

AB  - Jeff Raskin coined the term Information Appliance at Apple Computer in 1978. Martin Libicki advanced the concept of the Battlespace from his 1996 Telemetry of War essay in which our modern notion of netcentric warfare was advanced. Using these concepts we incorporate the modern information technology phenomena of everyware and persistent computing toward evolution in new forms of human enhancement. Given that most if not all humans will eventually equate to information devices in persistent computing architectures - we refer to them in this research as Human Information Appliance (HIA). This project is first and foremost a futures oriented product for the purpose of thinking about - in advance - risk and resilience analysis and management for a time that is beginning to feel familiar - if yet to come. We apply the HIA concept in a futures scenario where the arrival of exponential computational speed may produce effects to create novel solutions for human-machine environments/spaces. This form of human enhancement may also pose significant risk that requires a public ethical analysis toward prescriptive policy work in the present.

It is well known that the operation of interpretative transcription of texts written in Cyrillic is extremely laborious, but it will solve a problem of great interest to humanities researchers who are concerned with the study of the Romanian language in its diachronic evolution. We think that the present study will impact the humanities research, including that of paleography, history, archaeology and that field of linguistics interested in the study of the language in diachrony, but it will also help the researchers in the field of computational linguistics that develop models for old language, in order to develop a diachronic POS tagger, so necessary to recover old lemmata.

AB  - In the current world, more confidential information on untrusted repositories is maintained such that it is important to encrypt data on these pages. New encryption methods are being developed and improved from time to time. "AES" (Advanced Encryption Standard) is one such encryption protecting machine, which offers fine grained access control. Think of the ABE as a Cipher Scheme. However, the expressive mode of the ABE method can be problematic for the ABE in interpreting the key clarification and result in a low computational performance for the key problem and key decryption. To fix this issue, several outsourced versions of the Chinese Abacus (a concrete plane not made of beads on sticks), were built to improve the reliability of its use. This paper describes the various methods suggested and contrasts them, illustrating the benefits with the drawbacks.

AB  - As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues.

AB  - Problem based learning has been adapted by various universities and inscribed with perspectives based on the demographic challenges. The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process.
