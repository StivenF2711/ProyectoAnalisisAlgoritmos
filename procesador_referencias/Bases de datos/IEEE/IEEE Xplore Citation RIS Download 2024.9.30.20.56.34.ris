AB  - Tangram, a well-known traditional puzzle, is a tool in elementary education which is often associated with creative thinking. It consists of 7 boards (five triangles, one square and one parallelogram). Using tangram, we could build over 1600 kinds of shapes, such as houses, towers, and animals. However, it is very difficult to supplement a complete graphic with 7 boards. Therefore, this program was developed. In this program, the author used the DFS search algorithm and enumeration method to find all the solutions in the 13 convex figures in the Tangram. Then the author improved this search method to make the search algorithm run faster. The program is built using the Qt application development framework and C++ computer language and uses a user interface to display all the different results about the 13 convex graphics. The result of the research is that every convex polygon made of seven boards is not unique. Some graphics have only 16 transformations, but some will produce 224 different combinations of positions and colors.

AB  - Estimation of a object pose from camera is a well-developing topic in computer vision. In theory, the pose from a calibrated camera can be uniquely determined. But in practice, most of the real-time pose estimation algorithms suffer from pose ambiguity due to low accuracy of the target object. We think that pose ambiguity¡Xtwo distinct local minima of the according error function¡Xexist because of the phenomenon of geometric illusions. Both of the ambiguous poses are plausible. After obtaining the solution of two minima (pose candidates), we develop a real-time algorithm for stable pose estimation of a target objects with a motion model. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm diminish the significance of pose jumping and pose jittering effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the pose ambiguity problem with motion model in real-time application.

AB  - The functional aspect of the parts and assemblies is the engine that generates constructive solutions that satisfy customer requirements. When specifying design solutions, the designer always thinks in terms of function to be satisfied. However, this information is immediately lost once the design solution is validated. In this context this paper will first contribute to the enrichment of the “computer aided design, (CAD)” modeler database by integrating data related to product functions. Then, it will enrich the data related to assembly constraints by the fit aspect. It would be useful if the designer can specify, when creating an assembly constraint between a shaft and a hub (either through bearings, bushings or by direct contact), the type of constraint fit (tight, loose or uncertain). This information will be necessary, for example, when automatically generating assembly or disassembly drawings. The main objective of the proposed paper is the development of two applications. The first application named “computer aided design part function, (CAD PF)”, used for the enrichment of the parts database by the part function. The second one named “computer aided design adjustment constraint type, (CAD ACT)”, used for the enrichment of the database of assemblies by the type of constraint adjustment during their creation. These tools will be modeled by the graphical “system modeling language, (SysML)” and will be implemented using FreeCAD “Applications Programming Interfaces, (APIs)” which is an open source application.

AB  - The Ethernet becomes the fastest growing segment of industrial networking. Due to its high economic interest, at high speeds it will replace conventional fieldbus systems. Indeed, Industrial automation, Aircraft, Railway, Automotive and others domains, are increasingly being controlled via the Ethernet network. Its interest to be used in automotive field, in the powertrain and chassis domains, is growing day by day. Next-generation vehicles will be also controlled based on their interactions with the infrastructure as well as the environment. The cloud computing will be used to exchange real-time sensing and control information through vehicular wireless networks based on WiFi, WiGig and 5G networks. However, these networks are not developed for real-time vehicular control compliance. The use of Ethernet and wireless networks as a real-time control network for critical systems like powertrain and chassis vehicle domains is frequently questioned. Different solutions to modify them to meet real-time requirements have been proposed. This paper is interested to give more details concerning exactly this point. We will demonstrate that Ethernet and WiGig, when adducting the QoS priority policy and the duplication of the controllers in the end-points, can satisfy the real-time requirements when the throughput exceeds one Gbits/s that is, the modifications in each endpoint is quite simple to do. As many may think, the FlexRay network is mandatory for the powertrain and chassis modules and the Ethernet, the Wi-Fi, or its next generation, the WiGiG, can only support the body and multimedia domains. Its comparison with the Ethernet or the WiGiG proves that these latter networks are better when exceeding few gigabits per second for the four domains, with a minimum latency budget. We used the Network queuing theory to do these evaluations. We completed the classical four domains by two new domains, which are the advance driver assistance system and the V2X communications. These new domains are also connected via the full duplex Ethernet backbone, known as AFDX and μAFDX switching elements.

AB  - Wireless sensor nodes are deployed to gather useful information from the field but their constraint on battery power leads us to think about energy efficient routing protocols so that they can operate over longer periods of time. We study the advantages of having multiple chains in a network with each chain's topmost node (called the aggregator) collecting the data from the nodes beneath it and transmitting it to the sink. In the proposed scheme, a chain in each region works as PEGASIS. We also study how considering heterogeneity in the network can improve the lifetime of a network by a significant period. We assume that a fraction of the nodes in the network possess additional energy. We show by simulations that the introduction of heterogeneity into the network results in a greater lifetime, compared to those of the classical data aggregation schemes, with the duration increasing with the amount of additional energy considered.

AB  - 50 years ago, Gilbert and Elliott introduced 2-state Markov channels to characterize bursty error processes in data transmission. The focus of this work is on the analysis of the effect of bit errors on higher layer blocks or packets. Starting from 2-state bit error channels in an extended Gilbert-Elliott format, packet errors again result in a 2-state process of the same type. The parameters of the packet error process are explicitly derived from those of the underlying bit error process. The solution for main performance measures is based on a superposition of two geometrical functions for the distributions of packet error bursts and gaps and the second order statistics. Knowledge about the solution for 2-state channels is implicitly present in solutions for N-state Markov models by Turin et al, but which require a more complex factorization approach. The latter involves root finding algorithms for eigenvalues and eigenvectors and NxN linear boundary equations, going far beyond what is needed for a 2-state analysis. Conversely, analysis of Markov processes is excluded in other work on packet error evaluation due to the lack of simple solutions. Therefore the authors think it worthwhile to summarize the simple approach for popular 2-state channels.

AB  - There are many examples of cases where access to improved models of human behavior and cognition has allowed the creation of robots that can better interact with humans, and not least in road vehicle automation, this is a rapidly growing area of research. Human–robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important applied setting for human behavior modeling—but given the vast complexity of human behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: a successful HRI, in terms of safety, performance, and human satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most sensitive.

AB  - The Work-in-progress paper discusses the faculty development model. The workplace problems for engineers in the 21st century demands interdisciplinary skills. To cater to the need, the educators need to make interventions for inculcating interdisciplinary skills among students. The challenge is that very limited focus is on preparing the faculty towards building interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mentoring capabilities. The authors through this paper share an experience of deploying a faculty training model used for training the faculty towards mentoring interdisciplinary projects. The presented faculty development model is a result of the heuristic experience of four iterations and is organically evolved. The model was implemented in the context of a first-year engineering course titled Engineering Exploration. The course uses PBL pedagogy and every faculty, mentors a set of students to complete an interdisciplinary project. The nature of the projects in the course demands knowledge and skills from different domains to be applied at the mentioned stages. To mentor such interdisciplinary projects, faculty needs to be formally trained. However, in the literature authors found very limited architecture in the direction of standard frameworks and models that can be used to train the faculty towards interdisciplinary thinking and mentoring. The paper describes the evolved faculty training model consisting of four following phases where initial phases are focused on improving the technical skills among faculty members while the latter phase is focused on improving the mentoring skills.

This approach brings two benefits compared with benchmark PSCOPF algorithm: it reduces the computer memory occupation and greatly speed up the solving process thinks to the less iteration and the fast calculation in each iteration. It is illustrated can fast obtain the operation model which meets the N−1 secure criterion to prevent post-contingency constrained violations on several test systems.

AB  - In computer’s world these days cloud computing plays very important role. It gives user facilities like group of things such as software, platform and infrastructure services. Virtualization is the backbone of cloud resource sharing. Security is also a main problem of cloud. Multiple users have their own perception related to the cloud. By using cloud computing, user can access resources anywhere by using internet. So this technique is very useful in user’s daily life. One of the factors for cloud computing is cloud services which were provided by the cloud (IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS). These services enable users to access infrastructure, platform and software. Even resources are allocated to users according to their requirements. But many people think it is unsafe to use cloud resources and its services. It is unsafe to use cloud because there is no guarantee of information which is controlled or maintained by the vendors. There are some security issues that are noticed in cloud computing. In this paper, we have discussed a few issues with cloud computing and the challenges of cloud computing. This paper gives overall investigation of security on data, protection and issues in the cloud. The paper also defines the literature review related to the cloud computing issues and threats and also the various security concerns are discussed.

AB  - Word representation learned from the analysis of natural language does not usually reflect the true semantics of words. The paper proposes a new method, named Visually Supervised Word2Vec (VS-Word2Vec) model to achieve the representation of the relation words that are important in knowledge related tasks. Our method first computes the visual feature vector of relation words based on deep networks, and then achieve the visual similarity matrix for all relation words, which we think reflects their true semantics. VS-Word2Vec model then combines the visual similarity and the CBOW and builds an optimization problem to jointly learn the word vector representation. Therefore, VS-Word2Vec fuses the visual modality and natural language together. Experiments implemented over the public datasets demonstrate that VS-Word2Vec model really changes the distribution of word representation and achieves more effective results in describing their true semantics than CBOW model.

AB  - A simulation & implementation of a shortest path from the source to the destination in the amidst of obstacles using configuration space approach both with translations & rotations is presented in this paper.  One of the most important problems in robotics is the task-planning problem. A task is a job or an application or an operation that has to be done by the robot, whether it is a stationary robot or a mobile robot. The word ‘planning’ means deciding on a course of action before acting. Before a robot does a particular task, how the task has to be done or performed in its workspace has to be planned. This is what is called as Robot Task Planning (RTP). A plan is a representation of a course of action for achieving the goal. How the problem has to be solved has to be planned properly. Robot task planning is also called as problem solving techniques and is one of the important topics of Artificial Intelligence. For eg., when a problem is given to a human being to be solved; first, he or she thinks about how to solve the problem, then devises a strategy / plan how to tackle the problem. Then only he or she starts solving the problem.  Hence, robot task planning is also called as robot problem solving techniques.  Many of the items in task planning are currently under active research in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing and Robotics. Lot of research is going on in the robot problem solving techniques. The simulation & the experimental results show the effectives of the method used.

AB  - A form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is advanced and involves rules that are applied to data to simulate a person's thought process in a particular area, knowledge engineering can be described as an advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI). Knowledge engineering had evolved from its original form when it focused on transferring and analyzing knowledge from human problem-solvers into computer programs that could do the same. .It is essential to realize that transfer processing has limitations because humans make decisions differently than machines do. Non-linear thinking and analogous reasoning, often not logical, have not been considered in this case.It is becoming increasingly common today to use a modeling process for knowledge engineering, which creates a system that can reach the same conclusions as experts without following the same path or acquiring the same information from the same sources. In this paper, we aim to represent Knowledge engineering to transform knowledge into software that makes decisions similar to those made by human experts, such as financial advisors, whose decisions are based on their learning.Eventually, it is expected that human experts will be replaced by knowledge engineering in decision support software

AB  - For web services, QoS (Quality of Service, quality of service) is an important indicator for judging whether a web service is efficient. How to better predict the QoS value of the service to make appropriate service recommendations is the entire recommendation system and Issues that are being discussed in the service forecasting academia. At the same time, the timeliness and time relevance of QoS values are also affecting the prediction accuracy of Web services. A large amount of QoS data has potentially time-related attributes. This provides a new inspiration and thinking for service forecasting. Add the time characteristics of the data to the learning of the predictive model. Inspired by these factors, this paper proposes a deep neural network combination model that is sensitive to the time characteristics of QoS. At the same time, based on the final experimental results, the model proposed in this paper has obvious effects on the prediction of QoS values with time attributes.

AB  - The long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to provide machines the capabilities to learn, think and reason like humans. To achieve these long-term goals, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive-like abilities into AI systems to create truly self-adaptive artificially intelligent systems. This marriage of human cognitive skills with “machines” creates hybrid systems that have characteristics of both. The question becomes, which human cognitive model is appropriate for hybrid artificial intelligent systems. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of cognitive models to be infused into a modern radar system to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS). The notion of a hybrid artificially intelligent system can be divided into two main categories: (a) human-in-the-loop systems with hybrid augmented intelligence requiring human-AI communication/ collaboration, and (b) a cognitive computing-based AI in which a fully cognitive model is infused into the machine to allow fully autonomous operation. Here, we discuss the first type, human-in-the-loop cognitive radar systems that provide intelligent decision support and analysis for radar systems. The design of hybrid artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are presented with applications to improvement to modern radar systems, utilizing a Rasmussen Cognition Model (RCM), which we feel is appropriate for a hybrid cognitive system utilized to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS).

Since the reviews, ratings and feedback are crucial part of any business to keep track of what are views of the customers on the product. The reviews are the only way to keep up with the customer’s needs, advices and corrections that needs to be in the product. For a single type of product which a company sells, includes millions of reviews associated with it and a proper channel is needed to be employed to work with it so as to filter out the information what a customer thinks about the product or how the product is performing in the market. In this paper, authors compared the Ensemble Classifier with other algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Multinomial and found out that Ensemble Classifier outperformed the mentioned machine learning algorithms.

While doing the research work the algebraic-topological apparatus for identifying fractal-time structure of the observed signal based on physical phenomenology and p-adic metrics was used. The main result of the work is a new cognitive strategy of multidimensional methodological thinking, based on the following principles: modeling, diversification, complementarity, virtualization, tolerance, duality. The conclusions emphasize the relationship between asynchronous VI-environments ideology and Bergson's philosophy: the events produced by VI-environment components interaction, are objectively exist - they appear and disappear, simulating, thus, some continuous time flow.

However, the cost of such clusters and the existing pricing model of commercially available software packages lead to some interesting tradeoffs and business models. We propose the use of cloud computing and a corresponding pricing model that directly relates to the amount of computing accomplished. This should promote better utilization of both hardware and energy in using such software.

In modeling and simulation lab for the second year undergraduate students, the open ended experiment is designed to expose the students to Internet of things (IOT) applications. Python language is one of the freeware and can be used to implement IOT applications using Raspberry Pi. In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry. It also helps the students to carry out higher semester projects in IOT based applications in a better way.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurological condition that gradually affects memory, thinking, and reasoning abilities as well as daily functioning. The majority of people with this condition are elderly, particularly those over 65. The exact cause of this disease is still unknown, but it is now thought that it may be inherited, unintentional, or brought on by other factors. Actual assessment, CT examines, X-ray sweeps, and positron emission tomography, are a couple of techniques to analyze the disease, but X-ray checks are the most widely recognized one. Additionally, scanned images from MRI scans are used in this study. This study has established four groups for the condition: healthy, mildly demented, moderately demented, and very mildly demented. The most famous SVM technique is utilized in our proposed model along with a profound learning calculation because of its fast, trustworthy, and compelling activity. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and uniformed through pre-processing. After the information was parted into preparing and testing datasets in a 80:20 proportion, tuner advancement was done to naturally pick various boundaries to improve the model. The ailment and its classification are then resolved utilizing the SVM grouping and the model's exactness is 99.4%. In order to diagnose the patient's condition and discover an appropriate course of treatment and therapy, it helps the doctors identify the disease and the degree of its dissemination.

AB  - The growing population has added a burden to the existing power generation station. So what if the demand by the people exceeds the generation capability. The consequence is power deficiency. The world has to remain in dark weighing down the economy of the country. The alternative solution for this is generation mix. Now a day's commercial building is increasing at a greater pace. So in addition to generation mix we are thinking of making it economic. Economic is in the sense of reducing the grid dependency of a commercial building. Through this the cost incurred by a commercial building can be minimized to a greater extent, which can be utilized for some additional utilities. Generation mix includes the ultimate energy coming from sun, wind, tidal, geo-thermal, bio-gas, bio-mass. In this paper, aims at encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as Wind and Solar, available with the commercial building along with grid connection. A case study of National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST), Berhampur, Odisha, has been considered to validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and the result is estimated mathematically and verified through the renewable Simulink Software Homer V 2.81 incorporating present load and forecasted load for 4 years of planning horizon.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary framework using back propagation neural networks for performability evaluation of Kerberos servers. In the modelling approach, keys under pseudo-secure conditions are dynamically renewed and also, temporary interruption to link/server access is involved. This interruption has implications on mortification of system's performance. Since this effects the network communication's cost, an analytical model is created for evaluation. Analytical model's results provide understanding on the values of authentication key renewal(restoration) times, times passed between renewals(restorations) and failures(breakdowns) of the server. Additionally, another distinctive way of critical thinking and problem solving is suggested, and an intelligent system using back propagation neural networks is applied to detect performability modelling.

AB  - Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.

AB  - Computer communication networking is a very important topic in computer, electronics and communication education around the globe. Many students appear to think the subject technical and complex and this result in a low student engagement in these classes. Innovative teaching and learning strategies are needed to get the students interested in the subject. In this paper an activity based teaching and learning strategy is used to make the subject easy for understanding, to make the class interactive and increase student's interest in the topic. A dance activity was designed as an analogy to the OSI model of a communications system. To identify student perceptions of the activity, a survey was conducted of all students. The obtained results confirm that the students agree that this activity enables understanding and makes the learning process interesting. This perception is also confirmed by the attendance of students and the understanding demonstrated by them on classroom quizzes.

AB  - Recent years have seen rapid gaming development. As development speeds up, game complexity rises. Software engineers are using agile methodologies to enhance output. In this paper, a meta-model-based computer gaming model is shown. The meta-model was created for design reusability, with the purpose of building codes that automatically make implementations in a well-defined manner by constructing the sections individually and independently for implementation. Early game makers had little industry or resources. Space-time game modeling aids in computer game creation describes related topics and provides a game metamodel. Hand-coded parts and regulations make it harder to adapt to different game areas. MDD is an innovative software development method. Some people think drawing is enough to build a model. Diagrams are also needed. Models must have a well-defined, abstract syntax-illustrative structure consistent with met models. Building a space-time model for games allows for model language research. Meta models and OCL can close the design-implementation gap. The code structure facilitates sorting and querying models.

AB  - Clustering can be a valuable tool for analyzing large amounts of data, but anyone who clusters must choose how many item clusters, K, to report. Unfortunately, one must guess at K or some related parameter when working within each of the three available frameworks where one thinks of clustering: as a Euclidean distance problem; as a statistical model problem; or as a complexity theory problem. We report here a novel recursive square root heuristic, RSQRT, which accurately predicts Kreported as a function of the attribute or item count, depending on attribute scales. We tested the heuristic on 226 widely-varying, but mostly scientific, studies, and found that the heuristic's Kbest-predicted rounded to exactly Kreported in over half of the studies and was close in almost all of them. We claim that this strongly-supported heuristic makes sense and that, although it is not prescriptive, using it prospectively is much better than guessing.

AB  - A lot of people are scared of cancer since it’s so deadly. However, if caught and treated early, cancer has a high chance of being cured. The ability of computer-assisted diagnosis to serve as a primary screening test for many illnesses, including cancer, has contributed to its rise in popularity in recent years. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that gives computers intelligence by programming them to think like people. In this study, we explore the feasibility of training a deep neural network to provide such a prediction for breast cancer. Information is taken from a UCI-supplied dataset on breast cancer in Wisconsin. Over fitting is prevented by the early halting mechanism and the dropout layers in the neural network model, which together allow for an F1 score of more than 97.

AB  - With the gradual expansion of computer network services, the demand of various services for the network is also increasing. In order to ensure the normal and effective deployment of network services, it is necessary to improve or guarantee the key quality of service (QoS) in specific services as much as possible. In the application of computer network technology, artificial intelligence can simulate people's wisdom and thinking, and apply it in mechanical equipment, gradually making the application objects break away from manual control mode and become intelligent or automatic control mode. Internet has gradually become the mainstream communication mode, but there are still some problems to be solved urgently, the key of which is the optimization of computer network service quality. Based on various artificial intelligence technologies, this paper discusses the current situation and solutions of realizing service quality on the network, analyzes and summarizes the principles and characteristics of key technologies of service quality assurance, and finally looks forward to the development of network service quality technology.

AB  - Any agent-based model (ABM) involving agents that think or make decisions must inevitably have some model of agent cognition. Often, this cognitive model is incredibly simple, such as choosing actions at random or based on simple conditionals. In reality, agent cognition can be complex and dynamic, and for some models, this process can be worthy of its own dedicated ABM. The LevelSpace extension (Hjorth, Head & Wilensky, 2015) for NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) allows NetLogo models to open instances of other NetLogo models and interact with them. We demonstrate a method for using LevelSpace to simulate agents with complex, evolving cognitive models. We give the agents in a NetLogo predator-prey model "brains" themselves represented as independent instances of a NetLogo neural network model.

AB  - This paper discusses how to reveal the cognitive operation of human being from the perspective of granular computing, and discusses the uncertainty, ambiguity and other basic issues of cognition, and distinguishes, judges and identifies its link with thought operation. Human brain can only receive messages of different sensory attributes. A thing's state, movement and change process are reflected by its attributes and change process. Set up a granular computing model based on attributes and the judgment criterion change process and work out the basic logic rules for granular computing. The results show that this method can reflect the identification and judgment process with the attributes of uncertainty. At the same time, messages on granular conversion can be fully expressed through the definition of qualitative mapping, so as to better reveal the essential reason for ambiguous cognition of human. This model provides a new convenient tool for the study and stimulation of human's advanced intelligence and image thinking.

AB  - Artificial intelligence, as the main driving force of the new scientific and technological revolution, will inevitably bring some threat to the future in the process of upgrading and transformation, but more importantly, the new development opportunities. Ideological and political work has always been the “lifeline” of the work of the Party and the state, and will usher in unprecedented development opportunities in the era of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence as an information technology can enable ideological and political education in colleges and universities, one is to expand in time, space and situation, that is, to increase free time, expand space, and create a scene of localization to eliminate the dual opposition between the subject and object of ideological and political education and highlight its Noumenon; the other is to create a personalized education with meticulous, accurate and exquisite characteristics; and the third is to use “bit,” man-machine integration”, “Cognitive Outsourcing” realizes the co-construction, co-governance and sharing of ideological and political education resources in colleges and universities; fourth, using big data thinking, deep learning concept and machine learning. The principle of “black box” explores new laws, new ideas and new models of ideological and political education theory.

AB  - Visual perception is, by large, the main source of information used by humans when driving. Therefore, it is natural and appropriate to rely heavily on vision analysis for autonomous driving, as done in most projects. However, there is a significant difference between the common approach of vision in autonomous driving, and visual perceptions in humans when driving. Essentially, image analysis is often regarded as an isolated and autonomous module, which high level output drives the control modules of the vehicle. The direction here presented is different, we try to take inspiration from the brain architecture that makes humans so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving. There are two key theories about biological perception grounding our development. The first is the view of the thinking activity as a simulation of perceptions and action, as theorized by Hesslow. The second is the Convergence-Divergence Zones (CDZs) mechanism of mental simulation connecting the process of extracting features from a visual scene, to the inverse process of imagining a scene content by decoding features stored in memory. We will show how our model, based on semi-supervised variational autoencoder, is a rather faithful implementation of these two basic neurocognitive theories.

AB  - This paper challenges the current thinking for building High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems, which is currently based on the sequential computing also known as the von Neumann model, by proposing the use of Novel systems based on the Dynamic Data-Flow model of computation. The switch to Multi-core chips has brought the Parallel Processing into the mainstream. The computing industry and research community were forced to do this switch because they hit the Power and Memory walls. Will the same happen with HPC? The United States through its DARPA agency commissioned a study in 2007 to determine what kind of technologies will be needed to build an Exaflop computer. The head of the study was very pessimistic about the possibility of having an Exaflop computer in the foreseeable future. We believe that many of the findings that caused the pessimistic outlook were due to the limitations of the sequential model. A paradigm shift might be needed in order to achieve the affordable Exascale class Supercomputers.

AB  - Currently, in the field of Granular Computing, parameterized granularity has been widely explored by many scholars. Notably, the multi-granularity model for continuous parameters has also been attracted extensive attention. Based on such a model, it is often necessary to consider multiple granularities to evaluate the significance of candidate condition attributes in solving problems oriented to attribute reduction, which may lead to high time consumption. In view of this, one acceleration algorithm based on multi-granularity attribute reduction (MGAR) for continuous parameters is designed to decrease the time consumption of acquiring reduct. In fact, the acceleration method we proposed is on the basis of the thinking of positive approximation. Specifically, the iterations of evaluating and selecting condition attributes are carried out on the progressively decreased universe instead of the entire sample space. The experimental results over 10 UCI datasets show that the acceleration algorithm not only can effectively accelerate the process of searching reduct, but also can generate the same reduct with traditional approach.

AB  - This paper describes our experience teaching discrete-event simulation to several Engineering branches and Computer Science students. In our courses we emphasize the importance of conceptual modelling rather than the simulation tools used to build a model. We think that in discrete-event simulation university courses it is more important to provide knowledge to students to develop and analyze conceptual models than focusing in a specific simulation tool that will be industry dependent. Focusing in conceptual modelling with the support of a well-known simulation software provide the student with skills to create a model and then translate it to any simulator. Our courses use the Petri Net (PN) methodology by incrementing the complexity of models and PN using: Place-Transition PN, Timed PN and Colored Timed PN. A PN simulator is used to analyze the conceptual model and different rules and procedures are provided to match PN conceptual model to Arena simulation software.

AB  - Since the 1970's, the scientific field of model-based performance and dependability evaluation has been flourishing. Starting with breakthroughs in the area of closed queueing networks in the 1970's, the 1980's brought new results on state-based methods, such as those for stochastic Petri nets and matrix-geometric methods, whereas the 1990's introduced process algebra-type models. Since the turn of the century, techniques for stochastic model checking are being introduced, to name just a few major developments. The applicability of all these techniques has been boosted enormously through Moore's law; these days, stochastic models with tens of millions of states can easily be dealt with on a standard desktop or laptop computer. A dozen or so dedicated conferences serve the scientific field, as well as a number of scientific journals. However, for the field as a whole to make progress, it is important to step back, and to consider how all these as-such important developments have really changed the way computer and communication systems are being designed and operated. The answer to this question is most probable rather disappointing. I do observe a rather strong discrepancy between what is being published in top conferences and journals, and what is being used in real practice. Blaming industry for this would be too easy a way out. Currently, we do not see model-based performance and dependability evaluation as key step in the design process for new computer and communication systems. Moreover, in the exceptional cases that we do see performance and dependability evaluation being part of a design practice, the employed techniques are not the ones referred to above, but instead, depending on the application area, techniques like discrete-event simulation on the basis of hand-crafted simulation programs (communication protocols), or techniques based on (non-stochastic) timed-automata or timeless behavioral models (embedded systems). In all these cases, however, the scalability of the employed methods, also for discrete-event simulation, forms a limiting factor. Still, industry is serving the world with ever better, faster and more impressive computing machinery and software! What went wrong? When and why did ?our field? land on a side track? In this presentation I will argue that it is probably time for a change, for a change toward a new way of looking at performance and dependability models and evaluation of computer and communication systems, a way that is, if you like, closer to the way physicists deal with very large scale systems, by applying different type of abstractions. In particular, I will argue that computer scientist should ?stop counting things?. Instead, a more fluid way of thinking about system behavior is deemed to be necessary to be able to evaluate the performance and dependability of the next generation of very large scale omnipresent systems. First successes of such new approaches have recently been reported. Will be witness a paradigm shift in the years to come?

AB  - Due to the reasons such as the complicated preparation of reagents, danger, pollution, and lack of teacher resources, there are few chemical experiments that students can actually operate during the chemistry learning, which is not conducive to the chemistry learning and the phenomena principle understanding. Fortunately, MR technology provides us with the possibility of solving the safety issues and the space-time constraints, while the theory of human needs provides us with a way to think about designing a comfortable and stimulant MR system with realistic visual presentation and interaction. This study combines with the theory of human needs to propose a new needs model for virtual experiment. Based on this needs model, we design and develop a comprehensive MR system called MagicChem to verify the needs model. User study shows MagicChem that satisfies the needs model is better than the MR experimental environment that partially meet the needs model. In addition, we explore the application of the needs model in VR environment.

AB  - In the history of artificial intelligence (AI), primary agent focuses have been external environments, outside incentives, and behavioral responses. Internal operation mechanisms (i.e., attending to the self in the same manner as human self-awareness) have never been a concern for AI agent. Obviously, the learning concepts by which one pays attention to oneself has always been ignored by artificial intelligence researchers. However, we integrated a self-awareness mechanism into an agent's learning architecture, so that not only are an agent's thinking and behaviors closer to the ways that people operate, but also to allow agent-based social simulations to be even more akin to the real world. Our research objectives include: a) to propose a self-awareness agent model including external learning mechanism and internal cognitive capacity combining with having super-ego and ego personalities; b) apply an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game to represent the conflicts caused by public good and private interest in an agents' society, and analyze the effects of an agent's self-awareness capacity upon its individual performance and social cooperation behavior. Our goal is to show the ability of a cognitive learning model to improve intelligent agent performance and support collaborative agent behavior. We believe additional simulations and analyses will indicate enriched social benefits, even in cases where only a few agents achieve limited self-awareness capabilities.

AB  - Targeted malware evolved in recent years and that with encrypted payload appeared. The evolved targeted malware is difficult to be detected by static analysis and dynamic analysis on a virtual or stand-alone machine. The key for encryption is generated from information of a target computer. Therefore, the key is only known by an attacker and a victim computer. However, any targeted malware must collecting information of victim computer and we think this is a feature of targeted malware. First, we introduce our proposed method which detects targeted malware with encrypted payload by finding features of the collection behavior with machine learning. As a result, all test samples were classified to benign in our evaluation. We considered that features of our simulated samples are different from those of actual samples. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate of the difference and consider how we can create more precise simulated samples. We created map images of matched n-grams of our simulated samples with actual malware samples. We found hints of more precise simulated samples by looking distribution of the matched n-grams.

AB  - For collaborative learning to be successful, the instructor must carefully plan the formation of student groups. Typically, a teacher uses a set of conditions inferred from certain student parameters such as individual proficiency, learning and thinking styles, team-related traits and personality traits. While all of these parameters are instructor-driven, it is also favorable to get the teammate preferences of the students. Based on this, an instructor strategy can thus be generalized as an assignment problem that satisfies the most number of predetermined conditions based on these parameters and the most number of teammate preferences. In this paper, the generic model was implemented using constraint logic programming. Cohorts produced are evaluated based on the parameter constraints satisfied and on the number of teammate preferences satisfied. As such, the study demonstrates not only the feasibility of applying Constraint Logic Programming in the field of computer-supported group formation but also demonstrates that an instructor strategy can both include parameters decided by the instructor and teammate preferences from students.

AB  - Lately, deep learning has become increasingly popular in resolving issues across multiple domains, including medical image analysis. This research introduces a process based on deep convolutional neural networks to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and its various stages by utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly individuals can be quite difficult. This is because it harms the brain cells related to memory and thinking abilities, and it's hard to tell apart from normal brain patterns in scans. Detecting it needs a special way to represent features for sorting it out. Deep learning methods can acquire such representations from the MRI data. In this paper, five different transfer learning models are trained in 15 binary classifiers, each of them can classify two of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. This method finds the best transfer learning model for classifying each binary comparison. The proposed technique results in best accuracy of 92% for the AD vs. CN classifier, 94% for the AD vs. MCI classifier, and 72% for the MCI vs. CN classifier, which shows the effectiveness of transfer learning in distinguishing the AD vs. CN and the AD vs. MCI cases.

AB  - Evacuation is the movement of people away from threat in order to minimize loss. In deriving a proper evacuation plan, traditional approach or computer simulation may be used. There are wide selections of evacuation model currently made available, which can be categorized into three major approaches. Of all three modelling approach, Multi Agent System (MAS) model is considered as the best approach, in which it provides a realistic insight into evacuation process by including the human factor. Still, it leaves much room for improvement. This paper proposes an algorithm composed of two popular techniques from the field of Game Artificial Intelligence (Game AI), namely Behaviour Tree and Utility-Based AI, which will be applied in the decision making process of an agent. This algorithm is develop to simulate a realistic decision making process that can reflect a human thinking process, in order to overcome the issue of intention persistence of an agent in MAS model.

AB  - Ethics should be a practice, not a checkbox. Data scientists want to answer questions about individuals and society using the vast torrent of data that flows around us. Machine learning practitioners want to develop and connect complex models of the world and use them safely in critical situations. Ethical issues can be seen as getting in the way of the core idea and form pain points around managing, using and learning from data, as well as designing human-centric and ethical systems. This is because there is a design gap around ethics in data science and machine learning: the tools that we use do not support ethical data use, which means that data scientists and machine learning practitioners, already engaged in technically complex, multidisciplinary work, must add another dimension to their thinking. This work proposes and outlines an infrastructure and framework that can support in-the-moment ethical decision making and recording, as well as post-hoc audits and ethical model deployment.

AB  - The present study is based on developing a Green and Sustainable software because in the present-day computing devices are used for all kinds of purposes and they consume a lot of energy to perform these services. The ICT sector itself consumes a lot of energy so there is a need to think of alternatives that can reduce the level of energy consumption, thus, green ICT practice can be a good option. There is, however, a scarcity of researches that explains how the maintenance of green knowledge in ICT software development may be implemented. Since we recognize that software development process (SDL) plays an essential role in enabling the ICT community, uncontrolled green knowledge in developing software that would lead to the dilemma of failing to satisfy both the community's business and environmental requirements. Therefore, this research will concentrate on presenting a methodology applying an innovative model for managing the green software development and implementation. Keeping this concern in mind the present paper is going to provide a Green and Sustainable software model which can be used in green ICT practices and will be helpful in reducing the energy consumption used by computers.

AB  - As one of the most influential artificial intelligence programming languages, Prolog can naturally express human’s thinking and reasoning process. Thus, it has been widely applied in mechanical theorem proving, robot, intelligent planning, etc. However, the reasoning process of traditional Prolog is inefficient since it requires a lot of backtracking. This paper presents a novel linear reduction model different from the previous prolog derivation--generalized and/or graph search model, which can clearly represent variable (binding) constraints, so no backtracking is needed. In this model, a successful derivation of Prolog corresponds to a solution sub-graph of the corresponding generalized and/or graph. Therefore, the prolog reasoning is transformed into a searching process without backtracking, which can be parallel executed and greatly improves the efficiency of the prolog deduction. Furthermore, we discuss the transformation of artificial intelligence heuristic search technology, which is mature in both theory and practice, to Prolog reasoning, and obtain a more effective algorithm.

It intends to capture the interactions that are real between learner and instructor, but often simplified or even ignored in most adaptive learning approaches. An iterative negotiation protocol is employed to reconcile mutual thinking and cognitive differences between learner and instructor and then to dynamically produce the most appropriate learning sequences. To delineate the proposed framework, an example relevant to Java programming course is provided to illustrate how the adaptive learning environment with negotiation mechanism can improve the effectiveness of learning.

AB  - The deep multi-view stereo (MVS) approaches generally construct a cost volume pyramid in a coarse- to- fine manner to regularize and regress the depth or disparity, which is often built upon a feature pyramid encoding geometry or an image pyramid. A pyramid is an excellent approach to reducing memory, and many papers said even low-resolution images or features contain enough information for estimating low-resolution depth maps. However, recent papers show that the higher the image resolution, the better the output depth map, which means the resolution of depth maps in each stage cause effect on the final outputs. Therefore, we think the low-resolution depth map may not be enough for the high-resolution depth map. In this paper, we propose a sub-pixel upsampling module for post-processing the cost volume to generate a big resolution depth map at each stage. Besides, we also proposed an edge-weighted loss function for optimizing those inaccurate depth values in the edge regions of objects. Finally, we implement them on CasMVSNet, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method. The content of abstract.

AB  - Granular information processing is one of the human-inspired problem-solving aspects of natural computing, as information abstraction is inherent in human thinking and reasoning processes, and plays an essential role in human cognition. Among the different facets of natural computing fuzzy sets, rough sets and their hybridization are well accepted paradigms that are based on the construction, representation and interpretation of granules, as well as the utilization of granules for problem solving. These tools are also known as primary constituents of soft computing whose objective is to provide flexible information processing capability for handling real-life ambiguous situations. They have been successfully employed in various image processing tasks, including image segmentation, enhancement and classification, both individually or in combination with other computing techniques. The reason of such success is rooted to the fact that they provide powerful tools to describe uncertainty, naturally embedded in images, which can be exploited in various image processing tasks.

AB  - The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is in charge of the route exchange at the Internet scale. Anomalies in BGP can have several causes (misconfigurations, outages and attacks). Forged AS paths are small scale and subtle attacks on BGP and therefore are hard to detect. In this paper we use a Machine Learning (ML) model applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to take the temporal aspect of BGP into account. We show that our ML model is able to detect forged AS path anomalies with an accuracy of 67% and a precision of 72%. These preliminary results outperform the existing proposals and allow us to think that ML on temporal graphs is worth investigating.

The Timed I/O Automata (TIOA) modeling framework has been used for describing and analyzing many distributed algorithms, ranging from data-management algorithms to clock-synchronization algorithms to robot-coordination algorithms. These algorithms include timing aspects, and both discrete and continuous behavior. In this talk, I will describe the TIOA framework in some detail, and summarize many of the examples to which it has been applied. Then, I will discuss the extensions that are needed to enable it to handle more kinds of algorithms. These extensions will mainly involve adding and integrating features for handling probabilistic choices. I will review the state of the art for Probabilistic Timed I/O Automata models, and describe the work that I think is still needed.

Each of us holds different values with different degrees of importance. Existing studies show that values of a person can be identified from her social network usage. However, the value priority of a person may change over time due to different factors such as time, event, influence, social structure, and technology. In this research, we are the first to investigate whether the change of value priorities can be identified from social network usage. We have proposed a HMM based technique to capture the change of values of a person.

AB  - There exist a lot of incremental innovations to solve superficial problems. Breakthrough type innovation, however, is expected to solve latent problems. Consequently it realizes safe and wealthy society and competitive economy. Incremental innovation is realized by summation of several solutions in a conventional fixed dimension. The authors think that breakthrough type innovation is realized by expanding this dimension to missing dimension. A bladeless electric fan, a smart-phone, the cloud computing are the examples that new business model was born in a different dimension from conventional one. The authors propose a method to create this new dimension by the chemical model of catalytic effect. As an example; the innovation caused by smart meter is described. It is simply replacement by of an analog meter to digital within telecommunication in a fixed dimension to realized AMR (Automated Meter Reading). However, smart grid is applied as catalyst, smart meter get the opportunity of AMI. This creates breakthrough type innovation in electric power industry. The authors give some examples of catalytic effect producing new dimension such as smart phone, smart grid, etc.

The most common application system using natural language processing technology is information retrieval system. On this basis, an information processing model based on BP neural network (BPNN) and statistical method is discussed, and the principle of BPNN is explained in detail. After analyzing these phenomena, researchers think that natural language processing is more suitable for tasks requiring accurate results, and the understanding level of natural language processing is divided into seven levels from low level to high level: pronunciation level → morphology level → vocabulary level → syntax level → semantics level → pragmatics level → context level. On this basis, the application of natural language processing in information retrieval system is discussed.

The BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) specification is adopted to establish order process model. The model can be used to describe the company's core business and the order information transmission process with the process-oriented thinking. Then Web standard-JSF (Java Server Faces) is introduced to develop the system. The operation results show that order information can be transferred timely, fast, accurately, which avoids the delays or inaccuracies caused by manual operation. Meanwhile the managers can follow the tracks of the order progress at all times and provide clients with advice. The process-based order management system improved the information management ability of the printing enterprise and laid foundation for the realization of informatization enterprise-wide.

AB  - In a number of tasks for assessing natural and medical prints, deep neural networks have bettered humans. These achievements, however, are solely reliant on properly labelled training data. When presented with a few samples of noisy-labelled images, the network training strategy might encounter difficulties, resulting in a suboptimal classification models. The quality of medical picture annotations strongly depends on the knowledge and experience of the annotators, which makes this difficulty more acute in the context of medical image analysis. Such problem arises due to a number of reasons ranging from human error, inexperience or even misreading of the images. But at the same time, proper labels are exceptionally useful in training models, while improperly labelled data actually hampers the efficiency of the model. Label for a lot of the image dataset out there is actually already generated, but when we think about the noisy labelled data and go for an unsupervised learning model instead of a supervised model the labels that are correct are also going to waste. To solve this problem without wasting labels, a sparsely supervised learning strategy based on transfer learning is constructed with the aid of the keras Xception model. This paper compares the efficiency of a sparsely supervised learning model employing transfer learning to that of other traditional CNN models based on their performance metrics.

Educational institutions carried out the shift from the face-to-face learning model to the distance learning model to adapt to the pandemic situation to maintain educational activities' sustainability. Despite changes in learning models, education providers certainly want to maintain academic quality by producing graduates with superior academics, practical knowledge, and innovative thinking. The problem currently faced is how education providers can monitor students' performance to complete their studies correctly. Therefore, a grade prediction is needed that helps students, lecturers, and administrators of educational institutions maintain and improve academic quality. This study compares the techniques.

AB  - With the rapid development of science and technology, data is increasing exponentially. Data security has become a problem that people pay close attention to. How to ensure data security has aroused people's thinking. In order to ensure the communication security of network data, this paper points out the security threats in computer network communication, clarifies the significance of data encryption technology, and analyzes the commonly used data encryption methods in computer network communication. In this paper, a computer data security application model based on edge computing is constructed. In this model, data redundancy elimination method and differential privacy protection algorithm are adopted successively. After removing duplicate data and obtaining good quality data, the computer data is privacy protected, and the data security processing based on edge computing is realized. After testing, the privacy protection budget value of the built model is 0.23, and the computer data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is the smallest. Under this condition, the maximum data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is reduced from 0.678 to 0.234, and the data security is significantly improved.

AB  - Epilepsy is considered as one of the most dangerous and fatal neurological disorder for the patient suffering from it. It affects the particular areas of the brain, due to which patient has seizures. Epilepsy is often referred to as ‘mirgi’ in the Hindi language. The purpose of the paper is to identify and understand the prediction of the seizures that occur due to neurological disorder called Epilepsy. Epilepsy can be explained as the disorder of central nervous system, which results in abnormal activities inside the brain. The impacts of this disorder come out as seizures, and patient behaves in a weird manner. Sometimes the patient can even lose the track of consciousness and sensations, the power of thinking and reacting is also affected. When seen during Electroencephalogram, the brain wave patterns which are observed appear to be different and abnormal. It is one of the difficult diseases to be diagnosed. In this project, we have tried to find out the result as whether the patient is having an epileptic seizure or not, using machine learning models, like KNN, logistic regression and naïve bayes. The Output label column of the dataset has the value whether patient is having (1) or not having (0) a seizure. In this paper, we have preprocessed the dataset and calculated the accuracies of the models on both training and testing datasets. Dataset is extracted from GitHub and the coding is performed in python programming language. Python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpyetc are used in the pre-processing of the model. We have later on come to the result as out of the three models that we have used which one gives the best results, with the help of AUC value.

AB  - With the multiplication of cell phones, and their undeniably capable installed processors and capacity, huge assets progressively encompass clients. We have been exploring the idea of on-request framing of gatherings of adjacent cell phones group to perform computationally serious tasks as a support of nearby versatile clients, or what we call portable group registering. As gadgets can change in preparing force and some can leave a gathering out of the new gadgets participate, there is a requirement for calculations that can disseminate work in an adaptable way and still work with various courses of action of gadgets that can emerge in a specially appointed manner. In this paper, we first contend for the practicality of such utilization of group installed calculations utilizing hypothetical and writing about our tests on hotspot based closeness detecting. We at that point show a multi-layered work taking style calculation for conveying work effectively among cell phones and think about speedups achievable for various topologies of gadgets connected with hotspot, defending a topology-adaptable sharp approach. While our trials are with hotspot and cell phones, the approach is appropriate to systems of different installed gadgets with effective processors, organizing innovations, and capacity that will progressively encompass clients.

AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising technology that controls computers or machines using brain signals. With this technology, people with various disabilities, such as neural paralysis, and spinal cord injury can control electric devices or express their intention by thinking. However, previous BCI studies have a limitation that they can predict only one type of intention. To use the BCI system in daily life, the BCI user should be able to achieve various tasks such as moving, text typing, and arm movements. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional BCI method that can predict various intentions simultaneously. To classify multiple intentions, we proposed two prediction models using Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. To evaluate the proposed BCI system, the classification accuracy of the model was measured and compared using steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), sensory motor rhythm (SMR), and both of them (Multiple Intention). The average prediction accuracies were 22.46% in NN, 55.86% in CNN. These results indicate that the proposed multi-functional BCI can predict multiple intentions. It also means that users of the proposed BCI system can control various electric devices simultaneously.

AB  - We present a new conception of process service which is the extension of workflow. The separation of process logic from business logic is the key for building such service in system layer. However, the separation idea is often hard to be implemented because of inherent coupling characteristics in business process applications. None of workflow systems, including flexible workflow systems, is very successful in that aspect. We have analyzed WFMC model and find that there exist several defects in it. The model lacks necessary criterion and some of the elements are so inexplicit that they're implemented excessively randomly in workflow systems. We think that it's the root of the separation problem. We design a new model for process service. Compared with WFMC model, both the composition and the structure are changed. Especially, we constitute a framework on the model to realize the separation idea really and truly.

AB  - The computation of relative Saliency in fused approximate images' local area is the key of obtaining efficient image fusion coefficients. According to the statistical characteristic of wavelet approximate coefficients in fused image, wavelet Generalized Gamma Distribution(G Γ D) model is built for capturing the distribution of approximate coefficients in local area. GΓD model's parameters are estimated by Immune Clone Selection(ICS) algorithm derived from Evolutionary Computation thinking. The estimated parameters are applied in a new fusion strategy for obtaining the final fusion coefficients. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new approach when compared to the methods such as traditional contrast pyramid(CP) and wavelet fusion methods in terms of image information entropy(IE) values, average gradient(AG) values and standard difference(STD) values.

AB  - Transhipment is the process of moving goods from source to destination passing through several intermediate checkpoints. Tracking of a transhipment involves few issues that need to be addressed, like goods being a) damaged, b) lost c) delayed in delivery, d) delivered to wrong recipient, etc. All these issues are the major cause of dissatisfaction to the customers if no proper tracking system is available. In this case, Cognitive Agents (CAs) can be found helpful as they are capable of thinking and acting accordingly as a human brain. In this paper using CAs with Behaviour-Observation-Belief (BOB) model, the tracking of transhipment of goods is done. Its performance is good with respect to accuracy, successful transhipment rate and bandwidth consumption.

AB  - A microformat is a set of design principles for including semantic information within standard X/HTML markup. Individual microformat entities are distributed yet share a common semantics. Each microformat is a granule of structured information containing a set of attributes. These information granules can be produced, distributed, aggregated, and consumed without reliance on centralized services. We describe the impact on the gathering, distribution, and analysis of concepts within our visual communication research. In this paper we present solutions for managing lexical consistency when microformat-structured information granules are distributed and maintained independently and asynchronously. Lexical groups and hierarchies leverage the resulting inconsistencies, utilizing term aggregation across visual and linguistic features to dynamically compose lexicons and to perform lexical analysis. We think of this as creating semantic and orthographic 'projections' of the lexicon into different feature spaces. We show how to use this approach to construct situated lexicons which derive from shared context and social communities.

AB  - The emergence of cloud computing(CC), the three service levels of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and the cloud service delivery model of “cloud” + “end” have changed the development thinking of the entire IT industry. The education industry has also been influenced by new technologies and concepts, especially the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distribution”, which make the education industry face the challenges in teaching and learning resources management and laboratory management. In particular, the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distributed” - have given the education industry a revolutionary solution to the challenges faced in the management of teaching resources and laboratory management. In this paper, we design a simulation model of physical education(PE) teaching in CC based on Java. The results show that the Java-based CC PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for course learning; and being able to continuously improve students' performance. The results show that the Java-based cloud-based PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for the learning of the course; and continuously stimulating students' learning initiatives to achieve the purpose of improving academic interest indicators.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which is neurological and developmental condition. ASD can be detected by observing distinct patterns in an individual's learning, behaviour, communication, decision making ability and social interactions. The ability to anticipate emotions can prove beneficial in various situations, particularly when dealing with individuals across the autism spectrum with varying degrees of severity. Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading. Similar methods are used now to assist those who are autistic. There is also discussion of medical applications using minimal parameters and methods.

AB  - Asynchronous designs, described in the two-part tutorial in this issue of IEEE Design & Test, is a methodology which has never caught on as well as it should. But I think it is going to, and in an unexpected way. Asynchronous methods for neuromorphic computing are mentioned briefly in the tutorial. Modeling the brain, an initiative already begun, is going to become very important. There are major benefits to the health field in understanding how the brain works, which might lead to the cures of many currently difficult or impossible to cure diseases. A brain simulator can allow experiments which are unethical and impossible on humans. And some argue that the first artificial intelligence will be brought up on a brain simulator and not by using traditional AI methods.

AB  - In the context of virtual digital, the metaverse is regarded as an important field for the integration of computer technology and culture and art. Metaverse art must create metaphors based on media attributes like other media art. This article explains the necessity of the development of the metaverse, as well as the value of crypto art, and how to carry out new creative models and how to better embrace it. Never before have art forms in human history been as rich and complex as they are today, and the understanding of art is not only very demanding, but also requires high thinking and strong cultural judgment.

AB  - Word alignment is a key research in text information processing. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of word alignment by combining IBM 5-models, Word Entropy model and Support Information model organically[1]. The sub-models of the Support Information model includes: Minimum Intersection model and Minimum Difference model. Researches indicate that IBM model could implement word alignment with high recall value but low precision result, while the Support Information model can bring low recall value but high precision result and the Word Entropy model could effectively reduce the affected noises from other words. So we think up an idea that combining and utilizing the advantages of these models. Experimental result of our hybrid model obtains 89.19% of the f-measure, 88.74% of the recall and 89.66% of the precision.

AB  - In 2022, the image governs daily life. The Image guides navigation, the sharing of affections, political geography, and the evolution of knowledge in the most varied scientific areas. In this article, we will try to reflect on the positioning of the subject before digital technology and on how we can think about the real at this moment in history. In practical terms, the real has imposed itself in the last three years in which the pandemic by COVID-19 made us rethink the bases of our existence. Its relationship with image expressions, like indexicality, mimicry or visibility, seems obvious. However, the complexity of the image brought by digital technologies that capture, edit and/or construct in a participative way in realtime, implies that expressions like illusion, participation, simulation or creativity; become much more pertinent to the discussion of the image and the positioning of the subject. By dislocating/displacing reality, /replacing it, through the manipulative capacity offered by the technology that is essentially plasma through computer graphics and exponentiated in portable devices, the image lost one of the fundamental characteristics of its essence as testimony, gaining an interactive synaesthetic dimension and enhancing the creativity of the users/fruiters.

AB  - Travel is important for every human being and it impacts in all aspects of life ranging from personal to societal development. COVID'19 pandemic has changed the way we think to travel. Exploring the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the place the user needs to travel thereby facilitating user perception on travel is becoming a mandate nowadays. Travel perception is also important for variety of day-to-day activities like transportation of goods and services, health related travel etc., This work aims to create comprehensive and efficient prediction models, facilitated by a convenient user interface to predict how risky or convenient it is for a user to travel in a time where COVID-19 is prevalent. The predictions made are based on the location they wish to travel using various Machine Learning models. The results are combined with the individual's health history to arrive at an optimized decision. The model is trained using a comorbidities dataset as well as a location- wise weather dataset, which allows us to make the prediction of whether travelling is dangerous for the user or not. The user interface is designed to show predictions for various districts. The trained model is tested using the data provided in social media and government websites provided for prediction

AB  - under the background of economic globalization and financial integration, the financial market has gradually become an important part of the current market system. Besides the stock market is an important part of the financial market. From a macro perspective, government regulatory departments and policy makers can monitor the stock market by using stock index prediction model, so as to adjust macroeconomic policies in time. From a micro perspective, individual investors and enterprise investors can use stock index prediction model to improve their ability of avoiding risks, so it is of practical significance to build a high-precision stock index prediction model. In this paper, the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) method and SVR (Support Vector Regression) algorithm were combined to construct the EMD-SVR stock index prediction model, and the IEME (Improved Extreme Mirror Extension) method was proposed to suppress the end effect of EMD method to form the IEME-EMD-SVR model. Finally, through the empirical research on the transaction price data of Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index and the comparative study on EMD-SVR model and IEME-EMD-SVR model, it is proved that IEME-EMD-SVR model has higher prediction accuracy and lower time complexity. The proposed model has provided a powerful tool for stock index prediction and provided a new way of thinking for the application of time-frequency analysis in financial time series.

AB  - Summary form only given. At the core of Empirical Modelling is an activity we call `making construals'. A construal is a software artefact that embodies how we think about something, or make sense of something. For example, it might be a visualisation of a car engine with gears and controls that behaves - through interaction - like the physical car. We shall show a construal of MENACE : an early example of a simple machine (made with matchboxes) that learns to improve its own performance at playing noughts and crosses. Some experts in machine learning contrast the `big data' methods of training networks with the use of explanatory models. It is proving difficult, but desirable, to integrate these approaches. We'll suggest why Empirical Modelling might offer some useful insights into this problem.
