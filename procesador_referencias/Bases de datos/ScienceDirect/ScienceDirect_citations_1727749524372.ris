AB  - End-of-pipe permitting is a widely practised approach to control effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants. However, the effectiveness of the traditional regulation paradigm is being challenged by increasingly complex environmental issues, ever growing public expectations on water quality and pressures to reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. To minimise overall environmental impacts from urban wastewater treatment, an operational strategy-based permitting approach is proposed and a four-step decision framework is established: 1) define performance indicators to represent stakeholders’ interests, 2) optimise operational strategies of urban wastewater systems in accordance to the indicators, 3) screen high performance solutions, and 4) derive permits of operational strategies of the wastewater treatment plant. Results from a case study show that operational cost, variability of wastewater treatment efficiency and environmental risk can be simultaneously reduced by at least 7%, 70% and 78% respectively using an optimal integrated operational strategy compared to the baseline scenario. However, trade-offs exist between the objectives thus highlighting the need of expansion of the prevailing wastewater management paradigm beyond the narrow focus on effluent water quality of wastewater treatment plants. Rather, systems thinking should be embraced by integrated control of all forms of urban wastewater discharges and coordinated regulation of environmental risk and treatment cost effectiveness. It is also demonstrated through the case study that permitting operational strategies could yield more environmentally protective solutions without entailing more cost than the conventional end-of-pipe permitting approach. The proposed four-step permitting framework builds on the latest computational techniques (e.g. integrated modelling, multi-objective optimisation, visual analytics) to efficiently optimise and interactively identify high performance solutions. It could facilitate transparent decision making on water quality management as stakeholders are involved in the entire process and their interests are explicitly evaluated using quantitative metrics and trade-offs considered in the decision making process. We conclude that the operational strategy-based permitting shows promising for regulators and water service providers alike.

The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The brain controls most bodily functions, including awareness, movements, sensations, speech, thoughts, and memory. The spinal cord is connected to the brainstem and runs through the spinal canal. Some reflex movements can occur via spinal cord pathways without the brain structures being involved. In the brain, there are four types of neuroglia (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells). In the spinal cord, there are two types of neuroglia – the Schwann cells and satellite cells. About 90% of the nervous system consists of neuroglia. The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system, made up of a cell body, dendrites, and axons. Structural classifications of neurons include multipolar, bipolar, and unipolar. Functional classifications of neurons include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that aid in the transfer or impulses, with major examples including acetylcholine, biogenic amines, and amino acids. The brain is divided into the cerebral hemispheres, basal nuclei, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebellum. Chambers of the brain are known as ventricles. Filtering of information is handled by the thalamus, while the hypothalamus is the primary visceral control center, and regulates homeostasis in the body. The brainstem controls breathing, blood pressure regulation, heart rate, and movement. The cerebellum is also involved in regulating movement, as well as emotions, language, and thinking. The spinal cord provides two directions of impulse conduction to and from the brain, and is made up of 31 separate segments.

AB  - In system operations the term rollback is often used to imply that arbitrary changes can be reversed i.e. ‘rolled back’ from an erroneous state to a previously known acceptable state. We show that this assumption is flawed and discuss error-correction schemes based on absolute rather than relative change. Insight may be gained by relating change management to the theory of computation. To this end, we reformulate previously-defined ‘convergent change operators’ of Burgess into the language of groups and rings. We show that, in this form, the problem of rollback from a convergent operation becomes equivalent to that of ‘division by zero’ in computation. Hence, we discuss how recent work by Bergstra and Tucker on zero-totalized fields helps to clear up long-standing confusion about the options for ‘rollback’ in change management.

AB  - The life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique for assessing environmental impacts in order to identify the key points of a process/product/service as well as for suggesting alternatives to improve its environmental performance. The LCA methodology allows a "cradle to grave" perspective, considering that all the stages involved in the life cycle of a product or activity have a responsibility on the environmental consequences of it. Related terms as Life Cycle Engineering, Social Life Cycle and Life Cycle Thinking are emerging with a wide perspective. In this article, an overview of the main aspects of the used methodology is provided. Applications of LCA in food biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, biopolymers, biofuels and waste management of the biodegradable fractions are reviewed. Not only the utility of LCA to the biotechnological processes but also its main limitations are presented. Current tendencies in the LCA development highlight the need to update tools applicable to different areas with increasing demand of more accurate environmental information. Main footprints commonly used as LCA indicators have been recently combined with the final goal of obtaining a single indicator useful for decision-making. The interest of LCA for product design and the interactions of LCA with other environmental tools are also commented.

AB  - A fuzzy decision-theoretic computational approach for selecting optimal intensity measures (IMs) under the conditions of randomness, fuzziness and uncertainty is proposed in this paper. The main objectives of this study are twofold: (a) to quantify the contribution of multiple evaluation criteria, and (b) to improve the credibility of decision-making results by selecting the appropriate multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. To achieve these, three components of the methodology for this approach are utilized: (1) Fuzzy-probabilistic seismic demand analysis (FPSDA) is employed to consider the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the seismic demand analysis. (2) Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) is used to determine the importance weights of multiple evaluation criteria. (3) A combination of FAHP and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) is utilized to determine the optimal IM alternatives. First, the FPSDA method in which the interval PSDA is applied to evaluate the IM performance is developed. The interval results are transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers to establish a fuzzy decision-making matrix. Subsequently, the FAHP is employed to estimate the importance of each evaluation criterion. Then, FAHP–FTOPSIS is utilized to rank the orders of the IM alternatives and select the optimal IM. An illustrative application of the proposed methodology to a five-story reinforced concrete frame structure is presented. The decision results demonstrate that by considering the maximum inter-story displacement angle (θmax), top displacement (Dt), maximum floor velocity (Vmax) and maximum floor acceleration (Amax) as engineering demand parameters (EDPs), the average spectral displacement (Sdam), Sdam, average spectral velocity (Svam), and Vamvatsikos spectral acceleration (VSa2) are the most optimal IMs, respectively. The decision-making results for multiple EDPs indicate that Svam is the optimal IM. Furthermore, the Cordova spectral acceleration (CSa) considering period prolongation has the highest closeness coefficient among the acceleration-related IMs. To verify the effectiveness of the new framework and methodology, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with that of the traditional MCDM method while ignoring fuzziness. The proposed methodology can be applied to other engineering structures and provide a reference for solving similar problems.

AB  - Neuroscience offers more than new empirical evidence about the details of cognitive functions such as language, perception and action. Since it also shows many functions to be highly distributed, interconnected and dependent on mechanisms at different levels of processing, it challenges concepts that are traditionally used to describe these functions. The question is how to accommodate these concepts to the recent evidence. A recent proposal, made in Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience (2003) by Bennett and Hacker, is that concepts play a foundational role in neuroscience, that empirical research needs to presuppose them and that changing concepts is a philosophical task. In defending this perspective, PFN shows much neuroscientific writing to be dualistic in nature due to our poor grasp of its foundations. In our review article we take a different approach. Instead of foundationalism we plead for a mild coherentism, which allows for a gradual and continuous alteration of concepts in light of new evidence. Following this approach it is also easier to deal with some neurological conditions (like blindsight, synaesthesia) that pose difficulties for our concepts. Finally, although words and concepts seem to seduce us to thinking that many skills and tasks function separately, it is language skill that – as neuroscientific evidence shows – co-emerges with action/perception cycles and thus seems to require revision of some of our central concepts.

AB  - In an effort to clarify how deductive reasoning is accomplished, an fMRI study was performed to observe the neural substrates of logical reasoning and mathematical calculation. Participants viewed a problem statement and three premises, and then either a conclusion or a mathematical formula. They had to indicate whether the conclusion followed from the premises, or to solve the mathematical formula. Language areas of the brain (Broca's and Wernicke's area) responded as the premises and the conclusion were read, but solution of the problems was then carried out by non-language areas. Regions in right prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe were more active for reasoning than for calculation, whereas regions in left prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobe were more active for calculation than for reasoning. In reasoning, only those problems calling for a search for counterexamples to conclusions recruited right frontal pole. These results have important implications for understanding how higher cognition, including deduction, is implemented in the brain. Different sorts of thinking recruit separate neural substrates, and logical reasoning goes beyond linguistic regions of the brain.

AB  - In this paper, we hypothesize that the effects of the degree of typicality in natural semantic categories can be generated based on the structure of artificial categories learned with deep learning models. Motivated by the human approach to representing natural semantic categories and based on the Prototype Theory foundations, we propose a novel Computational Prototype Model (CPM) to represent the internal structure of semantic categories. Unlike other prototype learning approaches, our mathematical framework proposes a first approach to provide deep neural networks with the ability to model abstract semantic concepts such as category central semantic meaning, typicality degree of an object's image, and family resemblance relationship. We proposed several methodologies based on the typicality's concept to evaluate our CPM-model in image semantic processing tasks such as image classification, a global semantic description, and transfer learning. Our experiments on different image datasets, such as ImageNet and Coco, showed that our approach might be an admissible proposition in the effort to endow machines with greater power of abstraction for the semantic representation of objects' categories.

AB  - Summary
Humans use rapid gaze shifts, known as saccades, to explore visual scenes. These movements yield abrupt luminance changes on the retina, which elicit robust neural discharges at fixation onsets. Yet little is known about the spatial content of saccade transients. Here, we show that saccades redistribute spatial information within the temporal range of retinal sensitivity following two distinct regimes: saccade modulations counterbalance (whiten) the spectral density of natural scenes at low spatial frequencies and follow the external power distribution at higher frequencies. This redistribution is a consequence of saccade dynamics, particularly the speed/amplitude/duration relation known as the main sequence. It resembles the redistribution resulting from inter-saccadic eye drifts, revealing a continuum in the modulations given by different eye movements, with oculomotor transitions primarily acting by regulating the bandwidth of whitening. Our findings suggest important computational roles for saccade transients in the establishment of spatial representations and lead to testable predictions about their consequences for visual functions and encoding mechanisms.

The better resolved data produced by current and future facilities requires faster and more efficient lens modelling software. Consequently, we present Lenstool-HPC, a strong gravitational lens modelling and map generation tool based on High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques and the renowned Lenstool software. We also showcase the HPC concepts needed for astronomers to increase computation speed through massively parallel execution on supercomputers. Lenstool-HPC was developed using lens modelling algorithms with high amounts of parallelism. Each algorithm was implemented as a highly optimised CPU, GPU and Hybrid CPU–GPU version. The software was deployed and tested on the Piz Daint cluster of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS). Lenstool-HPC perfectly parallel lens map generation and derivative computation achieves a factor 30 speed-up using only 1 GPU compared to Lenstool. Lenstool-HPC hybrid Lens-model fit generation tested at Hubble Space Telescope precision is scalable up to 200 CPU–GPU nodes and is faster than Lenstool using only 4 CPU–GPU nodes.

AB  - The United States Army is undergoing a re-definition of its Civil Affairs officer positions. A recent project to define the educational requirements for an Army Civil Affairs Officer (38G) identified an educational requirement to help officers understand the complex ways in which the operations that advance the achievement of one stabilization objective often hinder the achievement of other objectives. The system level thinking was seen to be frequently insufficiently ingrained amongst Civil Affairs Officers (and the leaders they advised), who were both often perceived to be inclined, in the face of the complexities of the situation on the ground, to become too narrowly focused on achieving their specific assigned responsibilities, limiting their ability to see how the mission effectiveness of what they were recommending would be influenced by the state and trajectory of other Sectors and how, in turn, their recommendations would influence the mission effectiveness of other Sector stewards. While system dynamics modeling has proven itself to be effective in capturing and effectively communicating feedback loops that define such non-linear (and non-intuitive) systems they do not, in themselves, provide sufficient modeling richness to comprehensively capture the critical spatial (geographical) determinants of a successful state reconstruction process. For these purposes, a multi-agent cellular automata model is recommended both as a vehicle for introducing students to the complex nature of the state reconstruction process and, eventually, for use in the field by deployed Civilian Affairs Officers at all levels. This paper describes the problem and the modeling approach to address it.

AB  - Social sustainability can be mentioned as one of the pivotal objectives towards sustainable development which has received the least attention comparing to environmental and economic dimensions during these past years. Due to its impact on organization’s competitive power, researchers have proposed models to measure social performance in supply chains. However, most of these researches reveal shortcomings once encountering the cases with a huge number of criteria due to their complex computations. In order to fill this gap, this study proposes a new soft computing multi-criteria interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy distance to ideal solution approach based on interval-valued Pythagorean closeness which performs outstandingly in cases with a high fluctuation in the number of criteria. A new mechanism is defined to distinguish the weak performing social factors through supply chains by classifying them into four categorize based on their performance and distance to the best performing factors. This approach is unique in the sense that it both covers a remarkable amount of uncertainty and eases the computational processes of the previous multi-criteria decision making approaches by modifying the steps to select the most ideal solution. The feasibility and applicability of this approach have been validated by applications to a numerical case and comparative analysis.

AB  - We live at present with a largely linear materials economy. Our use of natural resources is characterized by the sequence “take – make – use – dispose” as materials progress from mine, through product, to landfill. Increasing population, rising affluence and the limited capacity for the planet to provide resources and absorb waste argue for a transition towards a more circular way of using materials. When products come to the end of their lives the materials they contain are still there. Repair, reuse and recycling (the three “Rs”) can return these to active use. Repair, reuse and recycling are not new ideas; they have been used for centuries to recirculate materials and, in less-developed economies, they still are. But in developed nations they have dwindled as the cost of materials fell and that of labor rose over time, making all three Rs uneconomic. So what is novel about the contemporary idea of a circular materials economy? Haven’t we been there before? The “circularity” concept is a way thinking that looks not just for efficiencies but also for new ways of providing the functions we need. In the last decade momentum has gathered about this transition. The idea of deploying rather than consuming materials, of using them not once but many times, and of redesign to make this a reality has economic as well as environmental appeal. Governments now sign up to programs to foster circular economic ideas and mechanisms begin to appear to advance them. This chapter examines the background, the successes and the difficulties of implementing a circular materials economy.

AB  - “Evolvability” is a concept normally associated with biology or ecology, but recent work on control of interdependent critical infrastructures reveals that network informatics systems can be designed to enable artificial, human systems to “evolve”. To explicate this finding, we draw on an analogy between disruptive behavior and stable variation in the history of science and the adaptive patterns of robustness and resilience in engineered systems. We present a definition of an evolvable system in the context of a model of robust, resilient and sustainable systems. Our review of this context and standard definitions indicates that many analysts in engineering (as well as in biology and ecology) do not differentiate Resilience from Robustness. Neither do they differentiate overall dependable system adaptability from a multi-phase process that includes graceful degradation and time-constrained recovery, restabilization, and prevention of catastrophic failure. We analyze how systemic Robustness, Resilience, and Sustainability are related to Evolvability. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of Resilience as an adaptive capability that integrates Sustainability and Robustness to achieve Evolvability. This conceptual framework is used to discuss nine engineering principles that should frame systems thinking about developing evolvable systems. These principles are derived from Kevin Kelly’s book: Out of Control, which describes living and artificial self-sustaining systems. Kelly’s last chapter, “The Nine Laws of God,” distills nine principles that govern all life-like systems. We discuss how these principles could be applied to engineering evolvability in artificial systems. This discussion is motivated by a wide range of practical problems in engineered artificial systems. Our goal is to analyze a few examples of system designs across engineering disciplines to explicate a common framework for designing and testing artificial systems. This framework highlights managing increasing complexity, intentional evolution, and resistance to disruptive events. From this perspective, we envision a more imaginative and time-sensitive appreciation of the evolution and operation of “reliable” artificial systems. We conclude with a short discussion of two hypothetical examples of engineering evolvable systems in network-centric communications using Error Resilient Data Fusion (ERDF) and cognitive radio.

AB  - Fostering problem-solving skills is vital for students to tackle the complexities of the 21st century. The integration of educational technology has spurred scholarly interest in cultivating students’ problem-solving skills. A systematic examination of these scholarly pursuits can yield invaluable insights and serve as a reference for both researchers and practitioners. In this context, the current study conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following questions: (1) What and how are educational technological tools applied to promote problem-solving skills? (2) What instructional strategies are used? (3) What is the impact of the application on students’ development of problem-solving skills? Web of Science was the database used to search literature, and 69 articles were included after the screening procedure. After analyzing the included studies, key findings and implications include: (1) Technological tools deployed in these studies serve diverse functions, often combined to establish immersive learning environments, which indicates that incorporating diverse cognitive and practical technology elements into curriculum design is essential for students’ successful problem-solving; (2) Instructional strategies like scaffolding, guidance, tool training, course orientation, and peer collaboration are employed to facilitate students’ problem-solving proficiencies. This finding stresses the significance of a comprehensive approach to developing problem-solving skills, involving guidance, practical training, situational awareness, and collaboration; (3) The incorporation of educational tools in purposefully designed instruction has a positive impact on students’ problem-solving skills. Consequently, educators and institutions are urged to strategically embrace these tools to foster students’ problem-solving abilities.

AB  - The current study examines the teaching of 21st century skills during an online academic course. Drawing on the established community of inquiry framework, we assumed that student learning experiences would be correlated with their level of involvement, their perceptions of the course quality and ethicality, and the resulting skills improvement. One hundred and thirty-four (134) college students who enrolled in an online course answered our questionnaire. This course setting was developed in order to create an active learning atmosphere with diverse online activities that were intended to facilitate the learning of 21st century skills. A partial correlation was found between student involvement and their learning experiences. Significant correlations were found between student perceptions of their 21st century skills improvement, the course's quality, the course's ethicality, and their learning experience. We concluded that the course we created produced a meaningful learning experience which empowered students.

AB  - Forty-two years ago, Capra published “The Tao of Physics” (Capra, 1975). In this book (page 17) he writes: “The exploration of the atomic and subatomic world in the twentieth century has …. necessitated a radical revision of many of our basic concepts” and that, unlike ‘classical’ physics, the sub-atomic and quantum “modern physics” shows resonances with Eastern thoughts and “leads us to a view of the world which is very similar to the views held by mystics of all ages and traditions.“ This article stresses an analogous situation in biology with respect to a new theoretical approach for studying living systems, Integral Biomathics (IB), which also exhibits some resonances with Eastern thought. Stepping on earlier research in cybernetics1 and theoretical biology,2 IB has been developed since 2011 by over 100 scientists from a number of disciplines who have been exploring a substantial set of theoretical frameworks. From that effort, the need for a robust core model utilizing advanced mathematics and computation adequate for understanding the behavior of organisms as dynamic wholes was identified. At this end, the authors of this article have proposed WLIMES (Ehresmann and Simeonov, 2012), a formal theory for modeling living systems integrating both the Memory Evolutive Systems (Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch, 2007) and the Wandering Logic Intelligence (Simeonov, 2002b). Its principles will be recalled here with respect to their resonances to Eastern thought.

AB  - Crisis occurrence in the healthcare context is, for different reasons, a phenomenon that happens abundantly. The priority of the healthcare system during a crisis is to provide quality care and superior services to the injured people. However, given the usually extreme severity of the crisis that results in a significant number of injured people, proper and timely responsiveness of healthcare systems is a challenging issue This study proposes a novel framework using a hybrid simulation–optimization approach to measure the healthcare responsiveness in crisis to address this real-world problem. This paper closely connects operations research techniques to critical systems thinking notions to evaluate the behavior of a system in the face of crisis. Since all arriving casualties to the hospital are first taken to the emergency department (ED), the ED in a case study is used to illustrate the performance of the presented approach. We designed seven crisis scenarios and one scenario of the ED system in a normal situation and modeled them using discrete-event simulation (DES). Patients’ interarrival times act as the driver of workload experienced in ED during crisis scenarios of varying severity. For crisis simulation scenarios that are unable to cope with the severity of the crisis, we developed an optimization model in an optimization tool to determine the optimal configuration of resources. The optimal configuration can improve healthcare resilience. The results show that an interarrival time of 13.8 min is the maximum threshold, below which feasible solutions could not be found, and the ED system is likely to collapse.

AB  - The mapping function method is a common approach to improve the accuracy of WENO type schemes. However, with the demand of the accuracy improvement higher, the mapping function becomes more and more complex, and the calculation cost also increases significantly. In this study, a novel smoothness indicator mapping method called WENO-ISM is proposed based on the WENO scheme. It employs a simple function which amplifies the original smoothness to improve the scheme's accuracy. In addition to the difference of the mapping function, the superior innovation of the designed scheme is that the mapping object is changed to the smoothness indicator instead of the nonlinear weight calculated from the WENO-JS scheme. The underlying idea of this method is to use this mapping function to directly regard the optimal weight of the stencil in the relatively smooth region as the nonlinear weight. For these, the calculation cost can be greatly reduced without loss of accuracy. In the meanwhile, the simple mapping function itself is with higher accuracy and lower cost. Numerical experiments with one-dimensional linear advection and ADR analysis show that this scheme is superior to other mapped WENO schemes in accuracy and especially in computation cost. Furthermore, improved results of this scheme are obtained by several typical one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical cases.

AB  - The metabolomic analysis provides a powerful approach for delving into intricate biological metabolism. Given metabolomics data's complexity and high-dimensional nature, it necessitates applying advanced analytical techniques for meaningful interpretation. This chapter centers on the pivotal role of chemometric tools in metabolomic analysis. These tools encompass a wide range of statistical and computational methods that empower us to extract valuable insights from extensive and intricate metabolomics datasets. They play a itical role in tasks such as data preprocessing, noise reduction, feature selection, and multivariate analysis, thereby enhancing our ability to unveil biologically relevant information. Moreover, these tools facilitate the integration of data from diverse analytical platforms, allowing researchers to identify and validate metabolites that are indicative of specific biological conditions. Additionally, chemometric methods aid in elucidating metabolic pathways and exploring interactions among metabolites, shedding light on the underlying biology. Given the intricacies involved, it is ucial to utilize specific analytical tools, including but not limited to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Projection to Latent Structures (PLS), permutation tests, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Hence, this chapter is dedicated to navigating the multifaceted landscape of multivariate metabolomics analysis, highlighting both its advantages and limitations.

AB  - We present a framework for formally proving that the composition of the behaviors of the different parts of a complex, real-time system ensures a desired global specification of the overall system. The framework is based on a simple compositional rely/guarantee circular inference rule, plus a methodology concerning the integration of the different parts into a whole system. The reference specification language is the TRIO metric linear temporal logic. The novelty of our approach with respect to existing compositional frameworks–most of which do not deal explicitly with real-time requirements–consists mainly in its generality and abstraction from any assumptions about the underlying computational model and from any semantic characterizations of the temporal logic language used in the specification. Moreover, the framework deals equally well with continuous and discrete time. It is supported by a tool, implemented on top of the proof-checker PVS, to perform deduction-based verification through theorem-proving of modular real-time axiom systems. As an example of application, we show the verification of a real-time version of the old-fashioned but still relevant “benchmark” of the dining philosophers problem.

AB  - Analogies are ubiquitous in science, both in theory and experiments. Based on an ethnographic study of a research lab in neural engineering, we focus on a case of conceptual innovation where the cross-breeding of two types of analogies led to a breakthrough. In vivo phenomena were recreated in two analogical forms: one, as an in vitro physical model, and the other, as a computational model of the first physical model. The computational model also embodied constraints drawn from the neuroscience and engineering literature. Cross connections and linkages were then made between these two analogical models, over time, to solve problems. We describe how the development of the intermediary, hybrid computational model led to a conceptual innovation, and subsequent engineering innovations. Using this case study, we highlight some of the peculiar features of such hybrid analogies that are now used widely in the sciences and engineering sciences, and the significant questions they raise for current theories of analogy.

AB  - I consider the ontology of languages and the linguistic units said to constitute them, in the light of a speculative sketch of how languaging about language might give rise to the idea of a language. The focus is principally on the role of reflexivity and the development of writing in facilitating the decontextualisation, abstraction and reification of linguistic units and languages themselves. The main trend in modern linguistics has been to take the products of these processes as realia, and to retroject them on to languagers as the basis for their languaging activities: I touch on some of the deleterious effects of this on theorising about the acquisition, storage and production of language. Finally, I consider how in thinking about these matters the concept of different ‘orders’ of language has been and might be interpreted and deployed. Whether or not this concept has a useful role to play in formulating them, the ideas assembled here are offered in the hope that they might serve as a platform from which to debate the significance and implications of the stultifying effect our modes of metalanguaging have so far had on inquiry into our engagement with language.

With a particular focus on Escherichia coli, this review examines the lessons learned when studying microbial physiology and metabolism under conditions that simulate large-scale bioreactors and methods to minimize cellular waste through reduction of maintenance energy, optimizing the stress response and minimizing culture heterogeneity. With general strategies to overcome these challenges, biomanufacturing process scale-up could be de-risked and the time and cost of bringing promising syntheses to market could be reduced.

AB  - Local, spatial state-action features can be used to effectively train linear policies from self-play in a wide variety of board games. Such policies can play games directly, or be used to bias tree search agents. However, the resulting feature sets can be large, with a significant amount of overlap and redundancies between features. This is a problem for two reasons. Firstly, large feature sets can be computationally expensive, which reduces the playing strength of agents based on them. Secondly, redundancies and correlations between features impair the ability for humans to analyse, interpret, or understand tactics learned by the policies. We look towards decision trees for their ability to perform feature selection, and serve as interpretable models. Previous work on distilling policies into decision trees uses states as inputs, and distributions over the complete action space as outputs. In contrast, we propose and evaluate a variety of decision tree types, which take state-action pairs as inputs, and provide various different types of outputs on a per-action basis. An empirical evaluation over 43 different board games is presented, and two of those games are used as case studies where we attempt to interpret the discovered features.

First, an iterative approach is put forward based on the approximator and historical information. Meanwhile, an execution scheme for the iterative approach is provided by an optimization policy. Then, combined with the reference model and measurement data, an extended identification method is applied in secure communication. Subsequently, a quantum-leading-following-based optimization with mutation strategy (MQLFBO) algorithm is proposed as the optimization policy. Next, the global convergence and computational complexity are respectively discussed for MQLFBO algorithm in theory. Finally, simulation experiments are performed on parameter identification for DPSs and its application in secure communication, which verify the fast convergence and high precision of the developed method.

For the experiment system, the secure remote experiment system with JT-60 has been successfully accomplished. For the remote data acquisition system, it will be possible to equivalently operate experimental data obtained from LHD data acquisition and management system (LABCOM system) and JT-60 Data System.

AB  - Building retrofit has received renewed interests in recent years, driven by energy-savings and indoor environmental quality goals. Digital technologies such as building performance simulation and optimization algorithms have been used to identify optimal retrofit schemes, yet the existing approaches are limited by the slow running speed of physics-based models and sub-optimal results. This study describes a novel framework, the Building Performance Optimization using Artificial Neural Network (BPO-ANN), which can automatically identify optimal building retrofit schemes. A robust Artificial Neural Network model was developed and validated as a surrogate to rapidly assess building performances, which was then connected to a genetic algorithm in search of Pareto optimal. The impact of key design attributes on building performances have been assessed using sensitivity analysis. The BPO-ANN framework has been tested in a high-performing campus building in Northern China under two competing objectives: building energy demand and occupant thermal comfort. It can automatically identify optimal design schemes, which were expected to achieve an energy-savings of 4% and reduce the annual thermal discomfort percentage by 4%. Sensitivity analysis suggested that window-to-wall ratio and HVAC setpoint have contributed the most to the performances of the campus building, followed by the roof U-value and wall U-value. The study has contributed methodologically to simulation-based optimization method, with novelties in the use of neural network algorithms to accelerate the otherwise time-consuming physics-based simulation models. It has also contributed a robust procedure in the tuning of hyperparameters in neural network models, with marked improvements in model prediction and computational efficiency.

AB  - The idea that cognitive development involves a shift towards abstraction has a long history in psychology. One incarnation of this idea holds that development in the domain of mathematics involves a shift from non-formal mechanisms to formal rules and axioms. Contrary to this view, the present study provides evidence that reliance on non-formal mechanisms may actually increase with age. Participants – Dutch primary school children – evaluated three-term arithmetic expressions in which violation of formally correct order of evaluation led to errors, termed foil errors. Participants solved the problems as part of their regular mathematics practice through an online study platform, and data were collected from over 50,000 children representing approximately 10% of all primary schools in the Netherlands, suggesting that the results have high external validity. Foil errors were more common for problems in which formally lower-priority sub-expressions were spaced close together, and also for problems in which such sub-expressions were relatively easy to calculate. We interpret these effects as resulting from reliance on two non-formal mechanisms, perceptual grouping and opportunistic selection, to determine order of evaluation. Critically, these effects reliably increased with participants’ grade level, suggesting that these mechanisms are not phased out but actually become more important over development, even when they cause systematic violations of formal rules. This conclusion presents a challenge for the shift towards abstraction view as a description of cognitive development in arithmetic. Implications of this result for educational practice are discussed.

AB  - Whole class discussions (WCDs) are an important pedagogical tool for mathematics classes but are challenging to characterize across large numbers of observations because of their dynamic and complex nature. In this paper, we report on an exploratory method to characterize WCDs in mathematics classes across large numbers of observations that we refer to as Conversation Profile Analysis (CPA). CPA uses Latent Class Modeling (LCM) with live observation data to generate profiles of WCDs in middle-grade mathematics classes. We report on our exploratory use of CPA to analyze observation data from 259 WCDs about data and statistics in middle school classes making use of an innovative approach to instruction called Data Modeling. We identified 4 profiles of WCDs and found that these profiles varied in likelihood across time and were associated with different ways students talked about key mathematical ideas. We also discuss broader implications of the CPA approach to studying WCDs in math classes.

In order to achieve accurate TQA value, the model adopted a Bi-LSTM-based architecture to process video-related blog text as auxiliary part to provide additional information for our TQA architecture. First, the auxiliary part constructs feature vector for each video-related text by the model originating from Bi-LSTM and Seq2Seq. Then, the feature vector was feed to a well-trained decoder to reconstruct the original input data. Then, the feature vector complied with the blog textual data are inputted into end-to-end TQA modal based on the 3D CNN straightly. Comprehensive experimental results on the blog text/video dataset from the well-known truism website “http://www.mafengwo.cn/” have shown that the proposed model reflects the subjective quality of online texts more accurately, and has better overall blog TQA assessment performance than the other state-of-the-art non-reference methods.

AB  - Students' academic achievement relies on a variety of pedagogical, affective, and individual factors. The investigation of academic emotions and epistemic cognition has been a focal point in existing research. Previous studies have predominantly delved into the essence of students' epistemic cognition and academic emotions. Nonetheless, the correlation between the epistemic cognition, academic emotions, and academic success of Chinese undergraduate students remains inadequately explored. This research delves into the interconnectedness of these variables and examines which facets of epistemic cognition and academic emotions can forecast students' academic performance. A total of three hundred and eighty (380) Chinese undergraduate students were chosen via random sampling for this study. Their self-reported academic achievements were taken into account. Additionally, they completed questionnaires tailored to evaluate their epistemic cognition and academic emotions. The participants' scores underwent Pearson correlation and multiple regression analyses. The findings indicate that positive emotions correlate positively, while negative emotions correlate negatively with students' academic success. Furthermore, positive emotions and three categories of epistemic cognition were found to be predictors of students' academic accomplishments. In conclusion, it is deduced that both epistemic cognition and positive emotions play a role in enhancing students' academic success. The implications of these findings extend to educational psychologists, educators, and students, both theoretically and practically.

AB  - How can cognitive robotics inform developmental psychology researchers and what can developmental psychology tell us about creating robots? More importantly, how can cognitive robotics and developmental psychology nourish each other to become a symbiotic relationship for future research? We address the theoretical underpinnings of developmental change using a cognitive architecture implemented on a robotic system and how our theories of knowledge representation relate to critical periods of infant development. Next, we will show how descriptive theories of cognitive development, specifically Zelazo's Levels of Consciousness (LOC; Zelazo, 2000, Zelazo, 2004, Zelazo and Jacques, 1996), can be mapped onto a computational cognitive architecture (ACT-R; Anderson & Lebiere, 1998). Following our discussion of Zelazo's theory, we will apply the ACT-R architecture specifically to the problem of object permanence. Finally, we will address how cognitive robotics can serve as a computational proving ground of developmental psychology for future research.

AB  - The prevalence of IoT based technology in contemporary society allows for the planning of smart city infrastructure with individually owned devices as participating nodes in a social smart network. Edge computing application into such an IoT network facilitates the distributed computing framework by bringing the computational application closer to the end-users in form of Fog sub-networks, comprising the local participating end-user IoT nodes as service requesters and specialized servers catering to the requests, modelled for the infrastructure category they are delivering (Smart healthcare, ITS, Smart architecture, etc.). Opportunistic-based last-mile connectivity between the Fog servers and participating nodes aides the dynamicity of the topology for efficient information. Aiding the same, the proposed edge computing enabled, sustainable, opportunistic IoT-based intuitive data exchange, collection and operation scheme that employs a dynamic routing procedure that considers human interactions, their movement patterns and their decision-making process. The proposed scheme employs probabilistic history-based parameters that keep track of node interactions. The interactions are modelled on the Firefly PSO, allowing exploitation of the social mobility. The Fuzzy logic is used for hop decision making based on the social and attribute-based parameters which mimic intuitive and pragmatic decision making of humans in terms of social interactions and mobility.

AB  - In this increasingly data-rich world, visual recordings of human behavior are often unable to be shared due to concerns about privacy. Consequently, data sharing in fields such as behavioral science, multimodal communication, and human movement research is often limited. In addition, in legal and other non-scientific contexts, privacy-related concerns may preclude the sharing of video recordings and thus remove the rich multimodal context that humans recruit to communicate. Minimizing the risk of identity exposure while preserving critical behavioral information would maximize utility of public resources (e.g., research grants) and time invested in audio–visual​ research. Here we present an open-source computer vision tool that masks the identities of humans while maintaining rich information about communicative body movements. Furthermore, this masking tool can be easily applied to many videos, leveraging computational tools to augment the reproducibility and accessibility of behavioral research. The tool is designed for researchers and practitioners engaged in kinematic and affective research. Application areas include teaching/education, communication and human movement research, CCTV, and legal contexts.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of spatial visualization skills when students solve area tasks. Spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. We examined middle school students’ representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. Task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). Findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. By contrast, Low and Average Spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. A novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. From a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence.

AB  - Frequency and phase of neural activity play important roles in the behaving brain. The emerging understanding of these roles has been informed by the design of analog devices that have been important to neuroscience, among them the neuroanalog computer developed by O. Schmitt and A. Hodgkin in the 1930s. Later J. von Neumann, in a search for high performance computing using microwaves, invented a logic machine based on crystal diodes that can perform logic functions including binary arithmetic. Described here is an embodiment of his machine using nano-magnetics. Electrical currents through point contacts on a ferromagnetic thin film can create oscillations in the magnetization of the film. Under natural conditions these properties of a ferromagnetic thin film may be described by a nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the film's magnetization. Radiating solutions of this system are referred to as spin waves, and communication within the film may be by spin waves or by directed graphs of electrical connections. It is shown here how to formulate a STO logic machine, and by computer simulation how this machine can perform several computations simultaneously using multiplexing of inputs, that this system can evaluate iterated logic functions, and that spin waves may communicate frequency, phase and binary information. Neural tissue and the Schmitt-Hodgkin, von Neumann and STO devices share a common bifurcation structure, although these systems operate on vastly different space and time scales; namely, all may exhibit Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. This suggests that neural circuits may be capable of the computational functionality as described by von Neumann.

In this mixed methods study, 49 fifth grade students participated in Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons focused on developing stories through coding during a school district's summer program. Fifth grade students (elementary level) completed pre- and post-writing assessments to measure 1) overall writing skills, 2) development of ideas, writing organization, grammar and usage, and mechanics, and 3) writing stamina. After completing the lessons and assessments, 10 students participated in a semi-structured interview to document perceptions of their writing abilities and engagement in writing. The results of this study show there was a significant increase in the overall scores on a pre- and post-writing assessment as well as writing stamina, and the interviews revealed that students were motivated in the storytelling process through narrative writing. The findings of this study support the implementation of coding programs as a tool for classroom instruction and the promotion of the development of writing skills for elementary students.

AB  - This paper examines the concept of representation in the brain which occurs in the writings of the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911). Jackson was immersed in Victorian physiological psychology, a hybrid of British associationism and a reflex theory of the operation of the nervous system. Furthermore, Jackson was deeply influenced by Herbert Spencer, and I argue that Spencer's progressivist evolutionary ideas are in tension with the more mechanistic approach of the reflex theory. I also discuss Jackson's legacy in the 20th century and the longstanding debate about localisation of function in the brain.

AB  - This paper describes theoretical design principles emerging from the development of tasks for standard undergraduate mathematics courses that address applications to teaching secondary mathematics. While researchers recognize that mathematical knowledge for teaching is a form of applied mathematics, applications to teaching remain largely absent from curriculum resources for courses for mathematics majors. We developed various materials that contain applications to teaching that have been integrated into four standard undergraduate mathematics courses. Three primary principles influenced the design of the tasks that prepare future teachers to learn and apply mathematics in a manner central to their future work. Additionally, this paper provides guidance for instructors desiring to develop or implement similar applications. The process of developing these tasks underscores the importance of key features regarding the roles of human beings in the tasks, the intentional focus on advanced content connected to school mathematics, and the integration of active engagement strategies.

We propose a twofold resolution of this paradox, attempting, in the process, to bridge work done on categorization in vision, neuropsychology, and physiology.

AB  - With the surge of the large volume of data availability, Machine Learning and mainly Deep Learning techniques are the leading solutions in classification and predictive tasks, targeted at data-efficient learning. These models learn by training on many diversified samples in a process that is computationally expensive or time-consuming. Moreover, in many real-world scenarios, the amount of available data for training is unsuitable, because it is unlabeled or covers only portions of the whole reference domain cases. This paper proposes an alternative approach for document classification that leverages the distribution of the data projected in the multi-dimensional feature space to assess the weight of features in the final classification. The approach does not rely on traditional iterative methods for classification but builds a relevance measure to assess the relevance/importance of the features describing the domain of interest. The idea is to harness this metric to select relevant features and then express the values calculated by these metrics in natural language by exploiting fuzzy variables and linguistic labels to make human comprehension more immediate. The approach has been employed for emotion extraction from social media messages. The novelty of this approach is twofold: first, the well-known TF-IDF measure was reinterpreted as a relevance measure of emotions discovered in text content. Then, the discovered emotion relevance was described by fuzzy linguistic labels, defined on an ad-hoc-designed fuzzy partition, to express the data classification in natural language, more suitable to human understanding.

AB  - This article (a) draws from various theories of creativity (e.g., 4P and 6P theories) and (b) uses several concepts from the creativity literature (e.g., self-actualization, emergence) to evaluate the claim that AI can be creative. This approach suggests that, at most, the output of AI represents products which, although lacking, may be attributed with creativity. Such attributions are often mistaken, and, significantly, products say little about the underlying process. Indeed, criticisms previously leveled at the view that the social recognition of products is required of creativity also apply to AI output. Several examples of products and overt actions that have been mistakenly attributed with creativity are discussed. The most telling of these is the ostensible emergence by a machine. The conclusion is that it makes no sense to refer to “creative AI.” One alternative is to extend the concept of “artificial intelligence” to creativity, which gives us “artificial creativity” as the label for what computers can do. Artificial creativity may be original and effective but it lacks several things that characterize human creativity. Thus it may be the most accurate to recognize that the output of AI as a kind of pseudo-creativity.

AB  - Marine renewables – which include mainly wave, tidal and current energy – have been hailed, for the past decades, as a potential solution to support the decarbonization of the society. Portugal and Spain have been traditionally avid for the testing and demonstration of such technologies, but the implementation of marine capacity is yet marginal, and there are many uncertainties regarding the future of the sector in the region. The main objective of this article is to show a future projection of marine renewable energies in both Iberian and Macaronesian regions for 2030 to research and technological development communities. To obtain this future projection, General Morphological Analysis and advanced clustering techniques have been used. The results are divided into five groups of potential scenarios, which vary significantly due to different political, social and technological parameters. The influence of variables such as innovation speed, infrastructure implementation, and comprehensive metocean data availability emerges as pivotal determinants shaping the sector's course. The knowledge from this systematization is expected to be used by researchers, technicians, governments or by any other agency involved in marine renewable energies in Spain and Portugal, as a guidance for their new projects and research lines.

AB  - We develop a general formulation of quantum statistical mechanics in terms of probability currents that satisfy continuity equations in the multi-particle position space, for closed and open systems with a fixed number of particles. The continuity equation for any closed or open system suggests a natural Bohmian interpretation in terms of microscopic particle trajectories, that make the same measurable predictions as standard quantum theory. The microscopic trajectories are not directly observable, but provide a general, simple and intuitive microscopic interpretation of macroscopic phenomena in quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss how various notions of entropy, proper and improper mixtures, and thermodynamics are understood from the Bohmian perspective.

AB  - How do bilinguals solve arithmetic problems in each of their languages? We investigated this question by exploring the neural substrates of mental arithmetic in bilinguals. Critically, our population was composed of a homogeneous group of adults who were fluent in both of their instruction languages (i.e., German as first instruction language and French as second instruction language). Twenty bilinguals were scanned with fMRI (3T) while performing mental arithmetic. Both simple and complex problems were presented to disentangle memory retrieval occuring in very simple problems from arithmetic computation occuring in more complex problems. In simple additions, the left temporal regions were more activated in German than in French, whereas no brain regions showed additional activity in the reverse constrast. Complex additions revealed the reverse pattern, since the activations of regions for French surpassed the same computations in German and the extra regions were located predominantly in occipital regions. Our results thus highlight that highly proficient bilinguals rely on differential activation patterns to solve simple and complex additions in each of their languages, suggesting different solving procedures. The present study confirms the critical role of language in arithmetic problem solving and provides novel insights into how highly proficient bilinguals solve arithmetic problems.

AB  - File type identification (FTI) has become a major discipline for anti-virus developers, firewall designers and for forensic cybercrime investigators. Over the past few years, research has seen the introduction of several classifiers and features. One of these advances is the so-called n-grams analysis, which is an interpretation of statistical counting in classified fragments. Recently, n-grams based approaches were already successfully combined with computational intelligence classifiers. However, the academic body of literature is scant when it comes to a comprehensive explanation of machine learning based approaches such as neural networks (NN) or support vector machines (SVM). For example, how the input parameters, including learning rate, different values of n for n-grams, etc. influence the results. In addition, very few studies have compared the scalability of NN vs. SVM approaches. Therefore, a systematic research in comparing different approaches is needed to address these questions. Hence, this paper investigates this type of comparison, by focusing on the n-gram analysis as a feature for the two different classifiers: SVMs and NNs. This paper details our experiments with two NNs and four SVMs, using linear kernels and RBF kernels on RealDC datasets. In general, we found that SVM-based approaches performed better than the NN, but their scalability is still a challenge.

AB  - This study explores the implementation of a detailed model pharmaceutical production facility in an undergraduate engineering class. Xandar Pharmaceuticals (XP), a fictitious manufacturer, was created and presented to undergraduate engineering students during a current good manufacturing practices (cGMP11current Good Manufacturing Practices.) course in two forms: (1) 3D virtual model and (2) 3D printed model. Data was collected from three separate cohorts over three years with a total of 197 participants. Surveys would gauge student’s sentiments and collect feedback, while quizzes assessed technical understanding. Statistical analysis and effect size calculations would evaluate the differences among the three cohorts. Survey results indicate the 3D printed model has small positive effects on study vs control (groups) regarding understanding of general industry related functions and practices. The 3D printed model also improved students’ interest in critical thinking and investigation. Qualitative feedback and sentiment analysis indicate the model was well received by students and received positive feedback related to visualization, industrial relevance, and student engagement. Use of the 3D printed model (but not the 3D virtual model) has had positive quantitative effects on student quiz scores and feedback. Qualitative improvements to student attitudes and interest are encouraging and suggest further use of 3D printed models in other courses may be beneficial.

AB  - Social institutions make use of collective power to shape individual behavior. Attempts to modify these institutions to improve the welfare, fairness, or equity of a society will benefit from having an accurate view of human nature so one can design the interventions in ways that actually lead to the desired outcome. Therefore, evolutionary psychology - i.e. the study of human nature - is particularly relevant when creating or reforming institutions, and instrumental in minimizing the frequent unintended consequences that institutional design often brings about. Here, we review the computational structure of human anger, and then analyze the fit between Western criminal justice systems and this universal emotion. This analysis reveals structural correspondences between anger and features of the criminal justice system, although important anomalies are noted. Finally, we offer an evolutionary account of the emotion of hatred and show how hatred can account for some failures in the criminal justice system (e.g., episodes of extra-judicial killing – “lynching”). We suggest that, ultimately, societal institutions will succeed or fail based on how compatible they are with human nature.

The idea that a symbol is much more than a mere meaningless token that can be processed through some algorithm, sheds new light on higher brain functions such as language and cognition. We present in this article a computational framework that may help in our understanding of the nature of grounded representations. Two models are briefly introduced that aim at emphasizing the difference we make between implicit and explicit representations.

AB  - There are currently no widely shared criteria by which to assess the validity of computational models in systems biology. Here we discuss the feasibility and desirability of implementing validation standards for modeling. Having such a standard would facilitate journal review, interdisciplinary collaboration, model exchange, and be especially relevant for applications close to medical practice. However, even though the production of predictively valid models is considered a central goal, in practice modeling in systems biology employs a variety of model structures and model-building practices. These serve a variety of purposes, many of which are heuristic and do not seem to require strict validation criteria and may even be restricted by them. Moreover, given the current situation in systems biology, implementing a validation standard would face serious technical obstacles mostly due to the quality of available empirical data. We advocate a cautious approach to standardization. However even though rigorous standardization seems premature at this point, raising the issue helps us develop better insights into the practices of systems biology and the technical problems modelers face validating models. Further it allows us to identify certain technical validation issues which hold regardless of modeling context and purpose. Informal guidelines could in fact play a role in the field by helping modelers handle these.

AB  - The need for appropriate decisions to tackle complex problems increases every day. Selecting destinations for vacation, comparing and optimizing resources to create valuable products, or purchasing a suitable car are just a few examples of puzzling situations in which there is no standard form to find an appropriate solution. Such scenarios become arduous when the number of possibilities, restrictions, and factors affecting the decision rise, thereby turning decision makers into almost mere spectators. In such circumstances, decision support systems (DSS) can play an important role in guiding people and organizations towards more accurate decision making. However, conventional DSS lack the necessary adaptability to account for dynamic changes and are frequently inadequate to tackle the subjectivity inherent in decision-maker's preferences and intention. We argue that these shortcomings can be addressed by a suitable combination of Semiotic Theory and Computational Intelligence algorithms, which together can make up a new generation of DSS. In this article, a formal description of an Intelligent Semiotic Machine is provided and tried out in practical decision contexts. The results obtained show that our approach can provide well-suited decisions based on user preferences, achieving appropriateness while fanning out subjective options without losing decision context, objectivity, or accuracy.

AB  - Individual-based modelling (IBM) is a powerful tool for simulating complex biological communities. By defining a population as comprising individuals that differ from one another, IBM can simulate the assembly and organisation of complex communities under various eco-evolutionary processes in a large spatial scale, with tremendous variables or parameters considered simultaneously. IBM disentangles a complex system into various sub-systems interacting with each other, allowing us to develop a unified library with a modular design for a wide range of complex scenarios in community assembly. In such a library, a number of parameters-controlled processes can be primitively coded as the sub-systems (or sub-models). Here, we released a Python-coded library as a framework for Metacommunity Individual-based Modelling (MetaIBM). As an open-source library, the MetaIBM has several merits, including: (a) it can be used to simulate a wide range of ecological problems of metacommunities. The metacommunity landscape and its environment gradients can be designed flexibly by users. Users can selectively turn off or on and set up parameters-controlled ecological processes according to their needs. (b) It adopts optimised algorithms and adapts to the high-performance computing devices, so that the users can explore a wide range of parameters space synchronously within a reasonable time. (c) It can be used to simulate a group of communities with up to millions of unique individuals, which is an originally plain portrayal of natural communities. To guide potential users, we provided the source codes of the library and a user manual. In the present article, we gave four examples to demonstrate how to design and model a metacommunity using the MetaIBM, simulating the community assembly in an islands-mainland model under the metacommunity framework with (a) neutral assumptions, (b) niche assumptions, (c) slow evolution scenarios, (d) rapid evolution scenarios. The examples showed that the MetaIBM can efficiently fit the community assembly, and reveal several intrigued species diversity patterns under the interaction of evolutionary processes and dispersal processes at multiple scales. The MetaIBM will be continuously maintained and updated to provide more functions in the future.

AB  - Mankind’s destiny points toward a quest for the stars. Realistically, it is difficult to achieve this using current space propulsion science and develop the prerequisite technologies, which for the most part requires the use of massive amounts of propellant to be expelled from the system. Therefore, creative approaches are needed to reduce or eliminate the need for a propellant. Many researchers have identified several unusual approaches that represent immature theories based upon highly advanced concepts. These theories and concepts could lead to creating the enabling technologies and forward thinking necessary to eventually result in developing new directions in space propulsion science. In this paper, some of these theoretical and technological concepts are examined – approaches based upon Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, spacetime curvature, superconductivity, and newer ideas where questions are raised regarding conservation theorems and if some of the governing laws of physics, as we know them, could be violated or are even valid. These conceptual ideas vary from traversable wormholes, Krasnikov tubes and Alcubierre’s warpdrive to Electromagnetic (EM) field propulsion with possible hybrid systems that incorporate our current limited understanding of zero point fields and quantum mechanics.

AB  - Hospitals use medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) more often to give patients quality continuous care. MCPS isa life-critical, context-aware, networked system of medical equipment. It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture—data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action—are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder whose neural basis remains difficult to ascertain. Among the available pathophysiological theories, recent work has pointed towards subtle perturbations in the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance within different neural circuits. Computational approaches have suggested interesting mechanisms that can account for both E/I imbalances and psychotic symptoms. Based on hierarchical neural networks propagating information through a message-passing algorithm, it was hypothesized that changes in the E/I ratio could cause a “circular belief propagation” in which bottom-up and top-down information reverberate. This circular inference (CI) was proposed to account for the clinical features of schizophrenia. Under this assumption, this paper examined the impact of CI on network dynamics in light of brain imaging findings related to psychosis. Using brain-inspired graphical models, we show that CI causes overconfidence and overactivation most specifically at the level of connector hubs (e.g., nodes with many connections allowing integration across networks). By also measuring functional connectivity in these graphs, we provide evidence that CI is able to predict specific changes in modularity known to be associated with schizophrenia. Altogether, these findings suggest that the CI framework may facilitate behavioral and neural research on the multifaceted nature of psychosis.

AB  - Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 must be lowered to mitigate climate change and rising global temperatures. CO2 utilization is the most promising approach for the sustainable reduction of CO2 emissions. Interdisciplinary research is gaining increasing attention due to its broader application potential and the promising results of combining various fields. Artificial intelligence in catalytic research could be cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Machine Learning (ML) and 3D printing technologies may soon be able to produce nanoscale raw materials to synthesize the catalyst for commercial-scale applications. In this review article, recent advances in catalyst synthesis using 3D printing technologies and ML-based catalytic reactions, particularly those in CO2 hydrogenation, are critically analyzed, with a focus on the function of ML model prediction. ML approaches with high prediction accuracies are discussed comprehensively. Based on the literature Gray-box models can provide useful insights by revealing the essential catalytic traits, factors, and circumstances that affect the results. They can also provide a practical solution by fusing the benefits of black-box algorithms, such as ensemble models and NNs, with feature importance analysis. Finally, suggestions and recommendations for the potential applications of ML in chemical science, especially in heterogeneous catalysis, are provided along with future research directions.

AB  - Numerical cognition is a field that investigates the sociocultural, developmental, cognitive, and biological aspects of mathematical abilities. Recent findings in cognitive neuroscience suggest that cognitive skills are facilitated by distributed, transient, and dynamic networks in the brain, rather than isolated functional modules. Further, research on the bodily and evolutionary bases of cognition reveals that our cognitive skills harness capacities originally evolved for action and that cognition is best understood in conjunction with perceptuomotor capacities. Despite these insights, neural models of numerical cognition struggle to capture the relation between mathematical skills and perceptuomotor systems. One front to addressing this issue is to identify building block sensorimotor processes (BBPs) in the brain that support numerical skills and develop a new ontology connecting the sensorimotor system with mathematical cognition. BBPs here are identified as sensorimotor functions, associated with distributed networks in the brain, and are consistently identified as supporting different cognitive abilities. BBPs can be identified with new approaches to neuroimaging; by examining an array of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks in experimental designs, employing data-driven informatics approaches to identify sensorimotor networks supporting cognitive processes, and interpreting the results considering the evolutionary and bodily foundations of mathematical abilities. New empirical insights on the BBPs can eventually lead to a revamped embodied cognitive ontology in numerical cognition. Among other mathematical skills, numerical magnitude processing and its sensorimotor origins are discussed to substantiate the arguments presented. Additionally, an fMRI study design is provided to illustrate the application of the arguments presented in empirical research.

AB  - The emerging autonomous electric vehicles have facilitated the implementation of the shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) service. In real-life applications, the operations of SAEVs may be affected by various uncertain factors, such as uncertain travel time caused by traffic congestion and uncertain service time caused by unpredictable customer delay. It is essential to consider uncertain factors to design conservative and robust routes for SAEVs. In this paper, we study a routing optimization problem of SAEVs, where the charging schedules, uncertain travel time, and uncertain service time are considered. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total operational cost that consists of fixed cost and travel cost of SAEVs. A branch-and-price algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Specifically, a tailored label setting algorithm is introduced to identify the robust feasible routes with accessible charging schedules for the pricing subproblem. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of generated instances. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both solution quality and computational time. Besides, based on the sensitivity analyses, we show the impact of the budgets of uncertainty, maximum deviations of uncertain parameters, battery capacity, fixed cost, and charging speed on the SAEV service. This work can also provide inspirations of both models and algorithms for many other application areas, such as urban logistics.

AB  - One of the most resilient features in the design of intelligent buildings is control. When implemented and used properly, buildings with proper control systems can perform very well. Achieving this varying objective requires advanced automation and monitoring tools where buildings rely less on human control and more on the embedded intelligence. This entails an integration platform that employs sensing technologies, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, and various proactive and predictive digital capabilities. This chapter focuses on the role of modeling and control in tackling challenges for sustainability and health. It raises questions and provokes a debate about data-driven and computational design innovation and its position in buildings. Various modeling and control approaches including conventional and nonconventional are presented. The next-generation highly integrated building automation and control systems are described. Different approaches used in the design of major building technical systems are discussed. The main research trends in the field of advanced control that evolve around several approaches including model-based, model-predictive, data-based, agent-based, and exergy-based have been highlighted.

AB  - It is not clear whether personality is related to basic perceptual processes at the level of automatic bottom-up processes or controlled top-down processes. Two experiments examined how personality influences perceptual dynamics, focusing on how cognitive flexibility moderates the relationship between personality and perceptual reversals of the Necker cube. The participants viewed stimuli either passively or with the intent to either hold or switch the orientation of the Necker cube. The influence of openness was predominantly evident in conditions necessitating intentional control over perceptual reversals. The link between openness and intentional perceptual reversals was always moderated by cognitive flexibility, which was measured in three different ways. No relationship was detected between personality traits and reversals in the passive viewing condition, suggesting that relatively spontaneous adaptation-inhibition processes may not be personality-dependent. Overall, our research sheds light on the nuanced influence of personality traits on perceptual experiences, mediated by cognitive flexibility.

AB  - This paper presents Concrete Institutional Economics as an economic paradigm to understand how the wish for sustainable energy in times of economic crisis can be used to generate jobs as well as economic growth. In most countries, including European countries, the USA and China, the implementation of sustainable energy solutions involves the replacement of imported fossil fuels by substantial investments in energy conservation and renewable energy (RE). In such situation, it becomes increasingly essential to develop economic thinking and economic models that can analyse the concrete institutions in which the market is embedded. This paper presents such tools and methodologies and applies them to the case of the Danish heating sector. The case shows how investments in decreasing fossil fuels and CO2 emissions can be made in a way in which they have a positive influence on job creation and economic development as well as public expenditures.

AB  - Using the naturally-occurring data of official UK Parliamentary transcripts for the development of a new high speed rail project, this paper takes one characteristic of the design process, the use of precedent, to explore how problems and solutions are framed during discussion. In contrast to accounts of reframing that describe one big insight changing the design process we show how one particular precedent allows a series of attempts at reframing to take place in discussion. We conclude by arguing that precedents enable a diffusion of semi-objective meaning in discussion, similar to a prototype in a more conventional design process. This contrasts with other types of discourse elements, such as storytelling, that function through the subjective accumulation of meaning.

AB  - While Homo sapiens is without doubt our planet’s most advanced species capable of imagining, creating and implementing tools, one of the many observable trends in evolution is the accelerating merger of biology and technology at increasing levels of scale. This is not surprising, given that our technology can be seen from a perspective in which the sensorimotor and, subsequently, prefrontal areas of our brain increasingly extending its motor (as did our evolutionary predecessors), perceptual, and—with computational advances, cognitive and memory capacities—into the exogenous environment. As such, this trajectory has taken us to a point in the above-mentioned merger at which the brain itself is beginning to meld with its physically expressed hardware and software counterparts—functionally at first, but increasingly structurally as well, initially by way of neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces. Envisioning the extension of this trend, I propose theoretical technological pathways to a point at which humans and non-biological human counterparts may have the option to have identical neural substrates that—when integrated with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), counterfactual quantum communications and computation, and AGI ecosystems—provide a global advance in shared knowledge and cognitive function while ameliorating current concerns associated with advanced AGI, as well as suggesting (and, if realized, accelerating) the far-future emergence of Transentity Universal Intelligence (TUI).

Today, they are considered to be a form of additive manufacturing and direct digital manufacturing (DDM), and the printing methods have since advanced to create higher quality output. Fashion designers and maker enthusiasts have since found that 3D printing technologies can be modified for apparel, thus allowing process and workflow disruption, or even hacking of the technologies, so that it is now important to rethink traditional skill sets and evolve them. Although 3D printing applications are still in their infancy, this chapter focuses on a few cases around activewear apparel and footwear with the use of 3D printing as they have been unique in their development approaches, direct and computational 3D modeling applications, material uses (e.g., nylon, thermoplastic polyurethane, or TPU), and applied technologies (e.g., fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering, PolyJet printing). The intention is to shed light on the challenges and the potential future integration of 3D printing technologies in the activewear industry.

This chapter is about the learning mechanisms that arise from the assumption of dealing with linear and linear-threshold machines. In most cases, the covered topics nicely intercept different disciplines, and are of remarkable importance to better grasp many approaches to machine learning. The chapter covers classic topics, like normal equations and ridge regression, as well as representational issues in pattern recognition that are connected with the notion of predicate order. Linear-threshold machines are described along with related computational geometry issues, and the view that arises from Bayesian decision. Classic gradient learning algorithms, including the stochastic version, are described in the continuum setting, as well as the Rosenblatt perceptron algorithm. Finally, some complexity issues are covered in both the discrete and continuous setting of computation.

In order to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data and the security of the communications between power terminals and the smart grid intranet, a lightweight security authentication and key agreement scheme is proposed in this article. The scheme provides mutual authentication based on the SM2 algorithm and key agreement which can prevent various attacks. Furthermore experimental evaluation and comparative analysis is conducted to indicate that the proposed scheme can resist many types of attacks with lower amounts of total computational resources and lower communications bandwidth. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme is suitable for smart grid.

For a key binary human silhouette, ℜ transform is employed to represent low-level features. The advantage of the ℜ transform lies in its low computational complexity and geometric invariance. We utilize a novel string matching scheme based on edit distance is proposed to analyze different human actions. Compared with other methods, ours is superior because the descriptor is robust to frame loss in the video sequence, disjoint silhouettes and holes in the shape, and thus achieves better performance in similar activities recognition, simple representation, computational complexity and template generalization. Sufficient experiments have proved the efficiency.

While parametric approaches discussed in Chapter 3 are useful in rationalizing the phase obtained in HEAs and can also be useful in identifying the window of parameters that can lead to the formation of HEAs with a particular structure, the computational methods can be more predictive in nature. Among the computational approaches, the most prominent ones are CALPHAD method, ab initio calculations, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, and phase-field modeling. The introduction of artificial intelligence is a disruptive addition and at the same time an extremely promising innovation. The current chapter gives an account of the status of these approaches in the HEA research.

AB  - Handheld devices, especially networked handheld devices, are growing in importance in education, largely because their affordability and accessibility create an opportunity for educators to transition from occasional, supplemental use of computers, to frequent and integral use of portable computational technology. Why and how might these new devices enhance school learning? We begin by discussing a simple but important factor: networked handhelds can allow a 1:1 student:device ratio for the first time, enabling ready-at-hand access to technology throughout the school day and throughout the learner's personal life. We argue that designers need to understand the capabilities of the new generation of handheld computers and wireless networks that are most relevant for learning. We follow this with a discussion of Learning Science theories that connect those capabilities to enhanced learning. The capabilities and features feed into design practices. We describe a set of example applications that are arising from the capabilities, theories and design practices previously described. Finally, we close with a discussion of the challenge of scale.

AB  - It has been well documented for more than 30 years, that significantly more effort is needed to prepare the HPC workforce needed today and well into the future. The Blue Waters Virtual School of Computational Science (VSCSE) provides an innovative model for addressing this critical need. The VSCSE uses a Small Private Online Course (SPOC) approach to providing graduate level credit courses to students at multiple institutions. In this paper, we describe the rationale for this approach, a description of the implementation, findings from external evaluations, and lessons learned. The paper concludes with recommendations for future strategies to build on this work to address the workforce needs of our global society.

AB  - Computational Social Science (CSS) involves interdisciplinary fields and exploits computational methods, such as social network analysis as well as computer simulation with the goal of better understanding social phenomena. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) represent an effective research tool for CSS and consist of a class of models, which, aim to emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules (i.e., independent actions, interactions and adaptation), performed by multiple agents. The efficiency and scalability of ABMs systems are typically obtained distributing the overall computation on several machines, which interact with each other in order to simulate a specific model. Unfortunately, the design of a distributed simulation model is particularly challenging, especially for domain experts who sporadically are computer scientists and are not used to developing parallel code. D-MASON framework is a distributed version of the MASON library for designing and executing ABMs in a distributed environment ensuring scalability and easiness. D-MASON enable the developer to exploit the computing power of distributed environment in a transparent manner; the developer has to do simple incremental modifications to existing MASON models, without re-designing them. This paper presents several novel features and architectural improvements introduced in the D-MASON framework: an improved space partitioning strategy, a distributed 3D field, a distributed network field, a decentralized communication layer, a novel memory consistency mechanism and the integration to cloud environments.

AB  - This paper proposes a new framework that takes advantage of the computing capabilities provided by the Internet of Thing (IoT) paradigm in order to support collaborative applications. It looks at the requirements needed to run a wide range of computing tasks on a set of devices in the user environment with limited computing resources. This approach contributes to building the social dimension of the IoT by enabling the addition of computing resources accessible to the user without harming the other activities for which the IoT devices are intended. The framework mainly includes a model of the computing load, a scheduling mechanism and a handover procedure for transferring tasks between available devices. The experiments show the feasibility of the approach and compare different implementation alternatives.

The purpose of this paper is to argue that we know shockingly little about the answer to this question, to highlight what we do know, how important the answers are, and how modern neuroscience technologies that allow us to measure and manipulate neural circuits with high spatiotemporal accuracy might finally bring us some answers. Neural oscillations are perhaps the best feature of EEG to use as anchors because oscillations are observed and are studied at multiple spatiotemporal scales of the brain, in multiple species, and are widely implicated in cognition and in neural computations.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI. The paper concludes by proposing strategies to enhance the capabilities of school leaders and teachers in promoting AIED in basic education.

AB  - Two key aspects of human public languages are syntax and semantics, where syntax concerns the combinatorial structure of linguistic expressions and semantics refers to their content or meaning. So, the claim that humans have a language of thought, defended in particular by Jerry Fodor, amounts to the view that thoughts are representational (semantic) and thought processes are computational, that is, they involve transformations of symbolic structures on the basis of their formal (syntactic) properties. The fact that thought, like language, exhibits ‘productivity’ and ‘systematicity’ argues for a system of mental representation that has language-like structure.

AB  - Background
Snakebite victims are commonly seen in KwaZulu-Natal Hospitals, with only a minority of patients requiring antivenom. This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom.
Methods
A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed.
Results
Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery.
Conclusion
Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock. The addition of antihistamine and corticosteroids to adrenaline for premedication has no added benefit.

AB  - Sustainable development and digital transformation profoundly re-shape industrial societies but have been studied largely independently. In light of pressing global environmental and social challenges, both transformations need to be well aligned with each other to achieve multiple objectives such as listed under the UN Sustainable Development goals (SDGs). Quantitative research on interlinkages, energy and material implications, and co-dependencies between the different digital transformation (DT) and sustainable development (SD) strategies is emerging and has so far focused on estimating the overall potential and on life cycle assessment (LCA). To frame the problem systematically, we developed a hierarchy of system levels for studying society's material and energy use, including the four levels: product/process, process cluster, life cycle/material cycle, and economy-wide. We mapped major DT strategies and the SDGs to the hierarchy and found a wide gap in system coverage: While most DT strategies focus on the product, process and process cluster levels, the SDGs predominantly target the economy-wide level. Socio-metabolic and industrial ecology research is needed to inform decision makers on how the two transformations can be aligned to reach overarching societal goals, such as the SDGs, expanding on and moving beyond LCA. Future research needs to assess combinations of multiple DT and SD strategies. It needs to study how DT can help decouple human wellbeing from negative environmental and social impacts. Research needs to focus on the strategies’ deployment potential, infrastructure needs, impacts on material cycles, and potential to transform both service demand and industrial production.

AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) also referred to as Brain-machine interface (BMI) is a buzz word in the world of neuroscience, translating the human brain thoughts into the chip. These devices may be surgically implanted or placed externally. Such components allow the user to control the actuators or sense the input data through bilateral communication to achieve the task. Most of the current applications focus on neural-prosthetics, artificial limbs, cochlear implants, and assistive devices for people affected by neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and more. Initially, it was developed to assist persons with neurological disorders. Due to the evolution of noninvasive imaging components, BCI is being extended for public communication like the brain–brain interfacing. The implementation of BCI on neuromorphic hardware components would further improve the computational complexity, execution speed, energy efficiency, and robustness against local failure. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are contributing to computer vision, speech recognition, game control, autonomous vehicle systems, disease classification/prediction, and many more. Though BCI has improved the lifestyle of the end-users, the responsiveness of those devices is not alike natural elements. Hence, to create an effective pathway from a brain to the external world through mapping, augmenting, assisting and troubleshooting, many computational intelligence methods have been proposed. In this chapter, the translation of brain waves into features and further classified to control any applications in an open/closed environment with a secure mechanism along with adaptive learning algorithms will be discussed.

AB  - The new generation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) models that represent gas- and particle-phase chemistry and thermodynamic partitioning using discrete two-dimensional grids (e.g. SOM, 2D-VBS) cannot be efficiently implemented into three-dimensional atmospheric chemical transport models (CTMs) due to the large number of bins (tracers) required. In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical framework, termed the Oxidation State/Volatility Moment Method, that is designed to address these computational burdens so as to allow the new generation of SOA models to be implemented into CTMs. This is accomplished by mapping the two-dimensional grids onto probability distributions that conserve carbon and oxygen mass. Assessment of the Moment Method strengths (speed, carbon and oxygen conservation) and weaknesses (numerical drift) provide valuable insight that can guide future development of SOA modules for atmospheric CTMs.

AB  - In this article we follow a range of significant academics, practitioners and policy makers in highlighting the need to engage with the disruptive digital transformation of the fourth industrial revolution. Often called universe 4.0, this is an economy based on data that dilutes, in an unprecedented fashion, the boundaries between the physical, biological and digital world in all spheres of society. In having to face up to the uncertainty, complexity and speed associated with this global challenge, organisations of all kinds will be impelled to rethink future skills, jobs and business models. We focus on how this uncertain situation affects public relations. We suggest that the resulting paradoxes and controversies become an opportunity to research and reflect on the past and present of our discipline and redirect attention to the processes, strategies, and tools of intervention required for improved contemporary and future effectiveness. This present study analyses universe 4.0 processes affecting both the practice and the social function of public relations and argues for close linkages with multidimensional strategic intelligences and disruptive technologies based on artificial intelligence. It also involves conducting exploratory qualitative research based on a bibliometric analysis of specialised literature; undertaking content analysis via computational linguistics techniques; and applying Delphi methodology to consider public relations in universe 4.0. Our findings suggest not only that strategic intelligence is under researched in our field, but that a more developed public relations intelligence capable of adapting to universe 4.0 needs to be a hybrid of existing public relations and contemporary strategic intelligence.

AB  - Recently, much research has focused on causal graphical models (CGMs) as a computational-level description of how children represent cause and effect. While this research program has shown promise, there are aspects of causal reasoning that CGMs have difficulty accommodating. We propose a new formalism that amends CGMs. This edge replacement grammar formalizes one existing and one novel theoretical commitment. The existing idea is that children are determinists, in the sense that they believe that apparent randomness comes from hidden complexity, rather than inherent nondeterminism in the world. The new idea is that children think of causation as a branching process: causal relations grow not directly from the cause, but from existing relations between the cause and other effects. We have shown elsewhere that these two commitments together, when formalized, can explain and quantitatively fit the otherwise puzzling effect of nonindependence observed in the adult causal reasoning literature. We then test the qualitative predictions of this new formalism on children in a series of three experiments.

AB  - An extensive review and re-thinking of jet flame heights and structure, extending into the choked/supersonic regime is presented, with discussion of the limitations of previous flame height correlations. Completely new dimensionless correlations for the plume heights, lift-off distances, and mean flame surface densities of atmospheric jet flames, in the absence of a cross wind, are presented. It was found that the same flow rate parameter could be used to correlate both plume heights and flame lift-off distances. These are related to the flame structure, jet flame instability, and flame extinction stretch rates, as revealed by complementary experiments and computational studies. The correlations are based on a vast experimental data base, covering 880 flame heights. They encompass pool fires and flares, as well as choked and unchoked jet flames of CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C3H8, C4H10 and H2, over a wide range of conditions. Supply pressures range from 0.06 to 90 MPa, discharge diameters from 4 × 10−4 to 1.32 m, and flame heights from 0.08 to 110 m. The computational studies enabled reaction zone volumes to be estimated, as a proportion of the plume volumes, measured from flame photographs, and temperature contours. This enabled mean flame surface densities to be estimated, together with mean volumetric heat releases rates. There is evidence of a “saturation” mean surface density and increases in turbulent burn rates being accomplished by near pro rata increases in the overall volume of reacting mixture.

AB  - Despite its importance in mathematical problem solving, verification receives rather little attention by the students in classrooms, especially at the primary school level. Under the hypotheses that (a) non-standard tasks create a feeling of uncertainty that stimulates the students to proceed to verification processes and (b) computational environments – by providing more available tools compared to the traditional environment – might offer opportunities for more frequent usage of verification techniques, we posed to 5th and 6th graders non-routine problems dealing with area of plane irregular figures. The data collected gave us evidence that computational environments allow the development of verification processes in a wider variety compared to the traditional paper-and-pencil environment and at the same time we had the chance to propose a preliminary categorization of the students’ verification processes under certain conditions.

In industrial processes, its value is an imperative indicator, which demonstrates the dielectric property of material and compiles information including separation information, chemical equilibrium, chemical reactivity analysis, and solubility modeling. Since, the available ε-prediction models are fairly primitive and frequently suffer from serious failures especially when deals with strong polar compounds. Therefore, we have developed a novel data-driven system to improve the efficiency and wide-range applicability of ε using in material sciences. This innovative scheme adopts the correlation distance and genetic algorithm to discriminate features’ combination and avoid overfitting. Herein, the prediction output of the single ML model as a coding to estimate the target value by simulating the layer-by-layer extraction in deep learning, and enabling instant search for the optimal combination of features is recruited. Our model established an improved correlation value of 0.956 with target as compared to the previously available best traditional ML result of 0.877. Our framework established a profound improvement, especially for material systems possessing ε value >50. In terms of interpretability, we have derived a conceptual computational equation from a minimum generating tree. Our innovative data-driven system is preferentially superior over other methods due to its application for the prediction of dielectric constants as well as for the prediction of overall micro and macro-properties of any multi-components complex.

AB  - We discuss three concepts that have made it possible to develop a quantitative understanding of trends in transition-metal catalysis: scaling relations, activity maps, and the d-band model. Scaling relations are correlations between surface bond energies of different adsorbed species including transition states; they open the possibility of mapping the many parameters determining the rate of a full catalytic reaction onto a few descriptors. The resulting activity map can be viewed as a quantitative implementation of the classical Sabatier principle, which states that there is an optimum “bond strength” defining the best catalyst for a given reaction. In the modern version, the scaling relations determine the relevant “bond strengths” and the fact that these descriptors can be measured or calculated makes it a quantitative theory of catalysis that can be tested experimentally by making specific predictions of new catalysts. The quantitative aspect of the model therefore provides new possibilities in catalyst design. Finally, the d-band model provides an understanding of the scaling relations and variations in catalytic activity in terms of the electronic structure of the transition-metal surface.

AB  - The advent of the modern GPU architecture has enabled computers to use General Purpose GPU capabilities (GPGPU) to tackle large scale problem at a low computational cost. This technological innovation is also available on mobile devices, addressing one of the primary problems with recent devices: the power envelope. Unfortunately, recent mobile GPUs suffer from a lack of accuracy that can prevent them from running any large scale data analysis tasks, such as principal component analysis (Shlens, 0000) (PCA). The goal of our work is to address this limitation by combining the high precision available on a CPU with the power efficiency of a mobile GPU. In this paper, we exploit the shared memory architecture of mobile devices in order to enhance the CPU–GPU collaboration and speed up PCA computation without sacrificing precision. Experimental results suggest that such an approach drastically reduces the power consumption of the mobile device while accelerating the overall workload. More generally, we claim that this approach can be extended to accelerate other vectorized computations on mobile devices while still maintaining numerical accuracy.

AB  - Abstract:
The study of trust in Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) has been an area of interest for many researchers over the last years. This is due to the fact that trust is the basis for agent communication wherein entities have to operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Several approaches have been proposed to define logical semantics for trust in MASs. However, these approaches are limited to reason about trust based on the sole agents’ mental states. Therefore, this paper considers trust from a high-level abstraction based on the social correct behaviors of agents. Specifically, we propose a logical framework that allows us to reason about unconditional trust and time. In particular, we introduce a new logical language called Trust Computation Tree logic (TCTL) that extends the Computation Tree Logic (CTL) with a new modality to represent trust. We describe the semantics by extending the interpreted systems formalism and consider a set of reasoning rules along with proofs to support our logic. Finally, we evaluate our approach using a real-life case study in the e-business domain to explain our proposed logic in a practical application.
