AB  - Objective
This article posits four principal objectives related to the overarching goal of broadening the conceptualization of health literacy. We propose a social ecological approach to health literacy and patient engagement by illustrating how this multilevel approach offers an array of strategic options for interventions.
Discussion
A social ecological approach supports a broader understanding of health literacy that aligns with increased patient engagement. The ecological model highlights the importance of context, demonstrates how health literacy and patient engagement are inextricably connected, and gives rise to strategies to enhance them both. We illustrate the five multilevel intervention strategies for addressing low health literacy and promoting patient engagement: accumulation, amplification, facilitation, cascade, and convergence strategies. In addition, we provide a theoretical foundation to facilitate the development of interventions to enhance health literacy and ultimately increase patient engagement.
Conclusions
The practice implications of adopting a broader social ecological perspective to address low health literacy shifts the field from thinking about individual educational interventions to how individual interventions may be augmented or supported by interventions at additional levels of influence. The potential benefit of adopting a multilevel intervention approach is that combining interventions could produce synergies that are greater than interventions that only utilize one level of influence.

AB  - As a well-known stochastic optimization algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has attracted the attention of many researchers all over the world, which has resulted in many variants of the basic algorithm, in addition to a vast number of parameter selection/control strategies. However, most of these algorithms evolve their population using a single fixed pattern, thereby reducing the intelligence of the entire swarm. Some PSO-variants adopt a multimode evolutionary strategy, but lack dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, competition among particles is ignored, with no consideration of individual thinking or decision-making ability. This paper introduces an evolution mechanism based on individual difference, and proposes a novel improved PSO algorithm based on individual difference evolution (IDE-PSO). This algorithm allocates a competition coefficient called the emotional status to each particle for quantifying individual differences, separates the entire swarm into three subgroups, and selects the specific evolutionary method for each particle according to its emotional status and current fitness. The value of the coefficient is adjusted dynamically according to the evolutionary performance of each particle. A modified restarting strategy is employed to regenerate corresponding particles and enhance the diversity of the population. For a series of benchmark functions, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed IDE-PSO, which outperforms many state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence, robustness, and scalability.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a versatile technology for exploiting diversified feedstocks to produce a wide range of products, including biochar, bio-oil, and syngas with high potential in diverse applications. The cardinal motivation of pyrolysis research is to productively use diverse biomass to reduce adverse impacts on ecology and enhance process economics. However, complex reactions of pyrolysis pose operational challenges. Thus, the present review targets the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of pyrolysis to enhance the understanding for better process control, improved performance, and product distribution. Pyrolysis mechanisms of the major structural components of biomass, such as cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose, as well as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, are discussed in detail. Various modeling techniques and tools, viz., mathematical, kinetic, computational fluid dynamic modeling, and machine learning algorithms, have been employed to better understand the pyrolysis mechanisms and product distribution. In addition, the most critical challenges, namely aerosol formation, tar formation and their removal mechanisms, that severely impact the pyrolysis process and products are identified and reported. Thus, the present work critically discusses state-of-art biomass pyrolysis, focusing on the reaction mechanism, modeling, and associated challenges to overcome, given that the pyrolysis products and the process are enhanced.

AB  - To improve programming performance for a larger student population, this study shed light on the commonalities of high achievers in programming classes. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated high achievers in primary school programming classes. This study adapted the hedonic-motivation system adoption model to identify high achievers' perceived attitudes, flow experience, programming intentions and perceived teacher support. With a response rate of 72%, 54 primary schools participated in the study. A survey was conducted and four hundred and thirty-two students were included in the moderated mediation analysis. The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes. The practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - A fuzzy decision tree is an important tool for knowledge acquisition in uncertain environments. Most of the existing fuzzy decision tree algorithms do not systematically consider the impact of the non-linear characteristics of the membership degree of fuzzy sets; they are therefore unable to integrate uncertainty processing preferences into the selection of extended attributes. This paper initially offers a generalized Hartley metric model and calculation method. We then introduce a fuzzy consciousness function and further provide generalized fuzzy partition entropy for the attribute-selecting heuristic of a fuzzy decision tree. We subsequently propose a generalized fuzzy partition entropy-based fuzzy ID3 algorithm (abbreviated as GFID3) that can support decision making and analyze the performance of the GFID3 through several case-based examples. The experimental results show that the GFID3 algorithm demonstrates better structural characteristics and operability in practical applications and has high computational precision. It ameliorates the deficiencies of existing fuzzy decision tree algorithms and can be used in fields such as complex systems optimization, data mining and intelligent systems.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Electron surface dissipation and quantum-limited size tend to control the material properties of exterior plasmon oscillation as the size of metal nanoparticles goes into the nanoscale domain. The need to examine this characteristic behaviour and its potential becomes imperative. This study explores the effects of the damping constant of electrons and size quantum-based frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF) of small metallic materials using an elementary model of electrons in a confined box. The frequency-dependent dielectric function is employed to study quantum size impacts and damping constant in the optical spectra region. The quantum amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and the absorbing spectra of silver-cube geometry for different sizes by adding damping constant and without damping constant are critically examined. The findings reveal that when the damping constant effect is absent, the multiple crests emerge for the quantum-amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and absorbing spectra of the metallic materials, highlighting the electronic discretization levels in the tiny quantum-limited structure. While the damping constant is included, the multiple summits are hidden and vanish owing to a considerable widening of the structures independently. The change in the numerical results from the quantum case to the classical case for growing widths is further illustrated for both cases. The numerical results enhance our knowledge of damping constant dissipation and quantum limited-size impact in small-scaled plasmonic devices.

AB  - Directing at the problem of inaccurate expression of tacit knowledge and low heuristic of retrieval results in the design inspiration drawing process of designers based on traditional motifs, a semantic data representation method of traditional motifs knowledge is put forward, and an effective knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval method for traditional motifs are described. First, the connotation of traditional motifs is deeply explored based on the theory of symbol semantics, realizing the interpretation and transfer of the semantic features in traditional motifs. Second, shape grammar is adopted for fractal traditional motifs, the hierarchical structure of traditional motifs is built, and the parametric coding of semantic features of traditional motifs is completed, providing the semantic data representation method of traditional motifs knowledge. Third, based on the clustering algorithm, the construction method of the traditional motifs knowledge base is explained, and a traditional motifs knowledge retrieval method taking into account the user's perceptual preference is proposed. Finally, setting the traditional Chinese motifs as an example, with a tea set as the designed product, the construction process of a small traditional motif knowledge base is shown in detail, proving the feasibility of this paper’s theory. Compared with the traditional theory, the semantic data representation method of traditional pattern knowledge is greatly advantageous in semantic differences elimination and computational efficiency.

KW  - KRO model
KW  - Knowledge graph

KW  - Intelligent adaptive learning model
AB  - The significant advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has led to the gradual emergence of intelligent adaptive learning as a pivotal modality for acquiring knowledge. The knowledge graph, as a crucial component of the intelligent adaptive learning model, assumes the vital responsibility of guiding and facilitating the learning process while evaluating its outcomes. The current knowledge graph, however, presents several challenges including fragmented knowledge content, inadequate ability characterization, and limited automatic construction capabilities, which hinder its effectiveness in assisting learners to achieve their learning objectives. The paper proposes the knowledge-resource-objective (KRO) model of knowledge graph, based on a robust correlation between knowledge, learning resources, and learning objectives. In the KRO model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is utilized for data pre-processing. Protége is employed for ontology construction. Entities and relations are synchronously annotated using the Main-Entity+ Relation +Begin-Inside-End-Single-Other (ME+R+BIESO) corpus labeling model to complete the triplet construction. Additionally, entities and relations are extracted synchronously utilizing a Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) model. Knowledge visualization and reasoning are achieved through Neo4j graph database. The study employs the Letter of Credit as a case study to examine the application of the KRO model, and assesses its efficacy through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The research demonstrates that the KRO model effectively targets learning objectives, restructures knowledge and resources, optimizes learning pathways, provides recommendations for learning resources, and visualizes learners' cognitive states. As a result, it enhances the effectiveness of intelligent adaptive learning. The subsequent research will continue to focus on the visual representation of learners' learning progress and explore the practical application of learners' profiles in diverse disciplines, aiming to facilitate the realization of personalized learning for individuals.

AB  - Purpose
Artificial intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks, Bayesian belief networks and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems, are complex mathematical models based on the human neuronal structure and thinking. Such tools are capable of generating data driven models of biological systems without making assumptions based on statistical distributions. A large amount of study has been reported of the use of artificial intelligence in urology. We reviewed the basic concepts behind artificial intelligence techniques and explored the applications of this new dynamic technology in various aspects of urological cancer management.
Materials and Methods
A detailed and systematic review of the literature was performed using the MEDLINE® and Inspec® databases to discover reports using artificial intelligence in urological cancer.
Results
The characteristics of machine learning and their implementation were described and reports of artificial intelligence use in urological cancer were reviewed. While most researchers in this field were found to focus on artificial neural networks to improve the diagnosis, staging and prognostic prediction of urological cancers, some groups are exploring other techniques, such as expert systems and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems.
Conclusions
Compared to traditional regression statistics artificial intelligence methods appear to be accurate and more explorative for analyzing large data cohorts. Furthermore, they allow individualized prediction of disease behavior. Each artificial intelligence method has characteristics that make it suitable for different tasks. The lack of transparency of artificial neural networks hinders global scientific community acceptance of this method but this can be overcome by neuro-fuzzy modeling systems.

AB  - Objectives
Computing the basic reproduction number (R0) in deterministic dynamical models is a hot topic and is frequently demanded by researchers in public health. The next-generation methods (NGM) are widely used for such computation, however, the results of NGM are usually not to be the true R0 but only a threshold quantity with little interpretation. In this paper, a definition-based method (DBM) is proposed to solve such a problem.
Methods
Start with the definition of R0, consider different states that one infected individual may develop into, and take expectations. A comparison with NGM has proceeded. Numerical verification is performed using parameters fitted by data of COVID-19 in Hunan Province.
Results
DBM and NGM give identical expressions for single-host models with single-group and interactive Rij of single-host models with multi-groups, while difference arises for models partitioned into subgroups. Numerical verification showed the consistencies and differences between DBM and NGM, which supports the conclusion that R0 derived by DBM with true epidemiological interpretations are better.
Conclusions
DBM is more suitable for single-host models, especially for models partitioned into subgroups. However, for multi-host dynamic models where the true R0 is failed to define, we may turn to the NGM for the threshold R0.

AB  - Given a distribution of pebbles to the vertices of a graph, a pebbling move removes two pebbles from a single vertex and places a single pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number π(G) is the smallest number such that, for any distribution of π(G) pebbles to the vertices of G and choice of root vertex r of G, there exists a sequence of pebbling moves that places a pebble on r. Computing π(G) is provably difficult, and recent methods for bounding π(G) have proved computationally intractable, even for moderately sized graphs. Graham conjectured that π(G□H)≤π(G)π(H), where G□H is the Cartesian product of G and H (1989). While the conjecture has been verified for specific families of graphs, in general it remains open. This study combines the focus of developing a computationally tractable, IP-based method for generating good bounds on π(G□H), with the goal of shedding light on Graham's conjecture. We provide computational results for a variety of Cartesian-product graphs, including some that are known to satisfy Graham's conjecture and some that are not. Our approach leads to a sizable improvement on the best known bound for π(L□L), where L is the Lemke graph, and L□L is among the smallest known potential counterexamples to Graham's conjecture.

AB  - Optimization is underlying technique of many graph-theoretic algorithms, including shortest paths and minimum spanning tree and hence – hidden component of landscape connectivity methods. Optimization solutions have different selectivity but it remains unexplored. Indeterminate solutions happen without warning and may be spatially biased. Errors are hidden. These issues may undermine connectivity measures and conclusions. Two optimization targets may be distinguished: mobile agent and connectivity provider, with different requirements. Review of how are they handled in literature finds them entangled and often misspecified, owing to inconclusive results, especially pronounced when conservation and explanatory goals are mixed. I categorize graph structures against targets and show how initial choice of structure introduces implicit optimization. Allowing for stochasticity of mobile agent resolves omniscience problem. Lastly, I advocate against creating landscape graphs with thresholds in favor of complete planar graphs. Thresholding is impractical, biased by design and yields non-optimal solutions due to simplistic partitioning.

Results show that U.S. teachers lag significantly behind Chinese teachers in SMK (concepts, computations, and word problems) and in some areas of PCK (e.g., such as identifying important points of teaching the fraction concepts and how to ensure students’ understanding). Although the Chinese teachers performed poorly in comparison to their U.S. counterparts on a test designed to measure GPK (e.g., psychological and educational theories and applications), its poor reliability calls these results into question. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of practical ideas for teacher training in the U.S. and China.

AB  - The spindle current of a machine tool contains a wealth of machining information and by analyzing its signal characteristics wear monitoring of milling tools can be achieved. Most current research in tool wear monitoring has been achieved by intelligent classification methods, but such methods are unable to identify wear states when cutting parameters change. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a new tool wear monitoring framework that identifies the wear state of milling cutters under different cutting parameters. The first step is to establish the mapping relationship between the spindle current signal and the milling force signal through neural networks under a variety of cutting parameters. Based on the mapping property between two signals, a TCN-LSTM based neural network prediction model is proposed to achieve accurate prediction of milling forces by spindle current signal. Various cutting information is then calculated based on the predicted milling forces and PLC communication, and a method is proposed to identify the machining status of the tool: the milling force coefficient monitoring method. The method reflect the wear status of the milling cutter by monitoring the range of threshold values, making the identification of the tool wear state without interference from variable spindle speeds, feeds and depths of cut. The proposed method provides a new solution for tool wear monitoring, breaking the inherent thinking of intelligent tool wear classification, and the experimental results prove the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.

AB  - Nuclear power has garnered significant attention as a clean energy resource in expediting carbon peaking and achieving carbon neutrality. It contributes to sustainable economic growth while addressing national energy security concerns. As one of the most crucial components, pressurized water reactors require improvements in several key aspects, including strengthening the natural circulation capacity, increasing the reactor power, and reducing the reactor volume. However, the volume of pressurized water reactors is usually positively correlated with their power. Increasing the reactor power results in an expansion of its volume, which poses challenges for the reactor layout and also requires additional investment. Hence, in order to reduce the reactor volume while meeting its performance requirements, this study introduces a novel design optimization approach utilizing an improved quantum fish swarm algorithm and intuitionistic linguistic decision-making. Firstly, a nonlinear mathematical model for volume optimization of the steam generator (SG) and pressurizer (PR) is constructed. Then, the improved quantum fish swarm algorithm is proposed to obtain volume optimization alternatives for the SG and PR. Quantum computation strategies are introduced to enhance the global optimization ability and population diversity. Additionally, the vision range and step size of the quantum fish swarm are adjusted adaptively to improve the optimization precision. To further accelerate the algorithm convergence, the prospect-elimination strategy is built. Last but not least, the intuitionistic linguistic decision-making is presented to gain the optimal design alternative by taking four characteristics into account, namely, the fuzziness and hesitancy of evaluation information, the consensus reaching process, the bounded rationality of decision-making behaviors, and the complementarity, independence and redundancy among nuclear evaluation criteria. A case study on the SG and PR design optimization is implemented to demonstrate the reliability and reasonability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Wearable technologies are the latest techniques used in the field of computational mental health care. There is a hope that using wearable technology some of the assumptions can be made, which reduces the cost of treatment. It helps patients staying in home rather than getting worse and admitted to any rehabilitation. The artificial intelligence (AI) is applied more specially in this field. AI technology is useful for patients to know there problem in prior and themselves take care of their health using applications as per their requirement. In this chapter, we have discussed wearable technologies and AI related to psychiatric disorders of people. The collected data till now support usage of AI-implemented models, other predictions, and treatments for mental disorders. Text-to-speech conversion also helps AI devices and patients can use it.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex and heterogeneous mental disorder, and researchers have only recently begun to understand its neuropathology. However, since the time of Kraepelin and Bleuler, much information has been accumulated regarding the behavioral abnormalities usually encountered in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Despite recent progress, how the latter are caused by the former is still debated. Here, we argue that circular inference, a computational framework proposed as a potential explanation for various schizophrenia symptoms, could help end this debate. Based on Marr's three levels of analysis, we discuss how impairments in local and more global neural circuits could generate aberrant beliefs, with far-ranging consequences from probabilistic decision making to high-level visual perception in conditions of ambiguity. Interestingly, the circular inference framework appears to be compatible with a variety of pathophysiological theories of schizophrenia while simulating the behavioral symptoms.

AB  - Commodity graphics hardware has seen incredible growth in terms of performance, programmability, and arithmetic precision. Even though these trends have been primarily driven by the entertainment industry, the price-to-performance ratio of graphics processors (GPUs) has attracted the attention of many within the high-performance computing community. While the performance of the GPU is well suited for computational science, the programming interface, and several hardware limitations, have prevented their wide adoption. In this paper we present Scout, a data-parallel programming language for graphics processors that hides the nuances of both the underlying hardware and supporting graphics software layers. In addition to general-purpose programming constructs, the language provides extensions for scientific visualization operations that support the exploration of existing or computed data sets.

In other words, we give a recursion-theoretic characterization of the complexity classes NCk for k≥1 without reference to a machine model, nor explicit bounds in the recursion schema. Actually, we give two equivalent descriptions of the classes NCk, k≥1. One is based on a tree structure à la Leivant, the other is based on words. This latter puts into light the role of computation of pointers in circuit complexity. We show that transducers are a key concept for pointer evaluation.

AB  - This paper presents a trajectory-tracking approach for verifying soundness of workflow/Petri nets represented by a decision-process Petri net. Well-formed business processes correspond to sound workflow nets. The advantage of this approach is its ability to represent the dynamic behavior of the business process. We show that the problem of finding an optimum trajectory for validation of well-formed business processes is solvable. To prove our statement we use the Lyapunov stability theory to tackle the soundness verification problem for decision-process Petri nets. As a result, applying Lyapunov theory, the well-formed verification (soundness) property is solved showing that the workflow net representation using decision process Petri nets is uniformly practically stable. It is important to note that in a complexity-theoretic sense checking the soundness property is computationally tractable, we calculate the computational complexity for solving the problem. We show the connection between workflow nets and partially ordered decision-process Petri net used for business process representation and analysis. Our computational experiment of supply chains demonstrate the viability of the modeling and solution approaches for solving computer science problems.

AB  - With the crystallization of the “generative enterprise” half a century ago, two concepts became salient: the initial state and final states of the language faculty, respectively, UG (the genetic component) and I-languages. Since then inquiry has gained far greater scope and depth. It has also led to sharpening of fundamental principles of language. At first, descriptive adequacy appeared to require rich and complex assumptions about UG. A primary goal has always been to overcome this deficiency. Core properties of concern have included compositionality, order, projection (labeling), and displacement. Early work assigned the first three to phrase structure rules and the last to the transformational component. Simplification of computational procedures suggests that compositionality and displacement (along with the “copy theory”) fall together while order may be a reflex of sensorimotor externalization, conclusions that have far-reaching consequences. As for labeling, minimal computation restricts options to the few that have considerable empirical support.

AB  - Systems or network biology focuses on the investigation of complex interactions in biological systems. Much of the promise of systems biology in biomedicine revolves around its potential to explain disease as a perturbation of a normal system. This chapter highlights many of the reasons that a systems biology–based approach is needed for understanding complex disorders. At its most basic, systems biology comprises three challenges: (1) how to generate a sufficient quantity of data to analyze variability in networks, (2) how to properly integrate data from multiple disparate sources into a usable corpus of knowledge, and (3) how to use that corpus of knowledge to model a component system and optimize it. Model construction allows predictions of the behavior of a system and, ultimately, an understanding of how to change that behavior in predictable ways. Once the key components are organized into a logical series, then formal modeling of the disease process can be applied, tested, additional experimental data added, the system calibrated, and retested. The optimal model or models are yet to be determined experimentally for any system, but with the continued rapid increase in high-throughput data generation and the continued increase in computational power, large-scale integrations and models can be achieved. The challenge will be to accurately anticipate the information necessary to be included in the model, as accurate assessment of the context is essential to the appropriate understanding of the effect of individual variation and the integration of that understanding into clinical practice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) education has posed fundamental challenges to early childhood education (ECE), including (1) why AI is necessary and appropriate for learning in the early years, (2) what is the subset of key AI ideas and concepts that can be learned by children, and (3) how to engage children in a meaningful experience that allows them to acquire these fundamental AI concepts. This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.

AB  - The nervous system is sensitive to statistical regularities of the external world and forms internal models of these regularities to predict environmental dynamics. Given the inherently social nature of human behavior, being capable of building reliable predictive models of others' actions may be essential for successful interaction. While social prediction might seem to be a daunting task, the study of human motor control has accumulated ample evidence that our movements follow a series of kinematic invariants, which can be used by observers to reduce their uncertainty during social exchanges. Here, we provide an overview of the most salient regularities that shape biological motion, examine the role of these invariants in recognizing others' actions, and speculate that anchoring socially-relevant perceptual decisions to such kinematic invariants provides a key computational advantage for inferring conspecifics' goals and intentions.

AB  - The study of children’s gestures has proved useful in understanding learning and conceptual development in subjects such as mathematics but has not yet been carried out in computing education. This paper presents an analysis of the way in which children describe programming concepts and their use of spontaneous co-speech gestures. We conducted two interviews at two different times (one directly after a programming activity, and one approximately two weeks later) with 45 primary school students in Saudi Arabia (aged 6 to 7). We analysed their responses when asked to explain two programming concepts: program and iteration. Participants using metaphorical gestures drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations, namely (i) computing constructs as physical objects (ii) computing processes as a motion along the path. Participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes (longitudinal, transverse, and frontal) when referring to chronological sequences. These findings were broadly in keeping with those found in previous work on University computing students’ gestures. However, our study also showed that gestures used by child learners whose first language is a right-to-left language (i.e., Arabic) had directional differences compared to the gestures used by adult learners whose first language is a left-to-right language (e.g., English). This work is the first step towards understanding young children’s embodied descriptions of programming concepts following introductory programming activities, and the potential role of gestures in supporting their learning.

AB  - As an inherent part of epidemiologic research, practical decisions made during data collection and analysis have the potential to impact the measurement of disease occurrence as well as statistical and causal inference from the results. However, the computational skills needed to collect, manipulate, and evaluate data have not always been a focus of educational programs, and the increasing interest in “data science” suggest that data literacy has become paramount to ensure valid estimation. In this article, we first motivate such practical concerns for the modern epidemiology student, particularly as it relates to challenges in causal inference; second, we discuss how such concerns may be manifested in typical epidemiological analyses and identify the potential for bias; third, we present a case study that exemplifies the entire process; and finally, we draw attention to resources that can help epidemiology students connect the theoretical underpinning of the science to the practical considerations as described herein.

KW  - Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks Applications of Deep Learning in Biology Patient Classification Molecular Modelling Molecular Networks Analysis Cellular Function Prediction
AB  - We are now well into the information driven age with complex, heterogeneous, datasets in the biological sciences continuing to grow at a rapid pace. Moreover, distilling of such datasets, to find new governing principles, are underway. Leading the surge are new and exciting algorithmic developments in computer simulation and machine learning, most notably for the latter, those centred on deep learning. However, practical applications of cell centric computations within the biological sciences, even when carefully benchmarked against existing experimental datasets, remain challenging. Here we discuss the application of deep learning methodologies to support our understanding of cell functionality and as an aid to patient classification. Whilst comprehensive end-to-end deep learning approaches that utilise knowledge of the cell and its molecular components to aid human disease classification are yet to be implemented, important for opening the door to more effective molecular and cell-based therapies, we illustrate that many deep learning applications have been developed to tackle components of such an ambitious pipeline. We end our discussion on what the future may hold, especially how an integrated framework of computer simulations and deep learning, in conjunction with wet-bench experimentation, could enable to reveal the governing principles underlying cell functionalities within the tissue environments cells operate.

AB  - Purpose
This paper aims to fully understand the relationship between students' classroom emotions and teachers' behaviors in the teaching environment, provide personalized teaching support, stimulate teachers' motivation, and enhance the emotional connection between teachers and students. This paper designs a teacher's ability model based on emotion-behavior relevance theory and artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Methods
Firstly, this paper expounds on the integration of emotion-behavior relevance theory, AI, and teacher's ability model under the background of ideological and political education. Subsequently, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is deeply analyzed in relation to the development of psychology and AI technology. Guided by the theory of emotion-behavior relevance, an ANN model is used to optimize the classroom emotion recognition module in the teacher's ability model. The accuracy of the optimized teacher's ability model in recognizing attention and resistance is verified by experiments. The relationship between the teacher's classroom emotions, students' classroom behavior, and the teacher's teaching ability is analyzed.
Results
The experimental results show that the optimized model can effectively identify students' classroom emotions, and the accuracy of identifying attention and resistance reaches 93.6 % and 92 %, respectively, significantly exceeding the traditional model. For other emotions, the accuracy of the experimental group ranges from 80.6 % to 87.9 %, while that of the control group is only 61.1 %. The optimized model shows a better effect on the emotional recognition of multiple students. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model. In addition, by analyzing teachers' emotions in real classroom videos, people can observe that teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors change with the changes in students' classroom emotions. Under the students' positive emotions, teachers scored high in psychological emotions, behaviors, and teaching achievements, with the lowest scores of 87, 80, and 85, respectively. Under students' negative emotions, teachers' related scores are low, with the highest scores of 40, 40, and 42. This highlights the critical influence of the emotional attitude and values of the main characters on teachers' teaching ability in the classroom environment from the psychological perspective.
Conclusion
Students' positive emotions, such as concentration and devotion, will arouse teachers' satisfaction and happiness, motivate them to teach more diligently, and improve the teaching effect. On the contrary, students' negative emotions, such as resistance and doubt, may cause teachers to feel depressed and discouraged. This proves the importance and effectiveness of integrating the emotion-behavior relevance theory into teaching. Students' emotions impact teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors and affect the teaching effect. In this case, teachers need to use their emotional adjustment ability to adjust their feelings in time to better guide students and improve teaching efficiency. This paper provides valuable insights for optimizing the teacher's ability model.

AB  - A review of helicopter rotor blade tip design technology has been carried out with a view to undertaking subsequent computations to evaluate the performance of new tip designs. The review starts by briefly looking at (fixed) wing tip design concepts and the underlying fluid mechanics on which they are based in order to see if there is any carry-over of ideas on which improved tip design concepts might be based. Then, rotor blade tip shapes that have been used, or suggested for use, on past and present rotorcraft are examined to obtain a better understanding of the helicopter tip design problem. In parallel, the review traces the development of analysis tools to evaluate the performance of the rotor and blade tip design. It is clear that in the past, the designer relied heavily on classical aerodynamic knowledge, supplemented by experience and intuition, supported by wind tunnel and model rotor testing, and relatively low-order aerodynamic calculations. New rotor designs were, and still are the subject of intensive flight test verification. However, recent development of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) now offers an opportunity to accurately predict the viscous, compressible flow-field in the tip region, and thus predict the performance of new rotor and tip designs, provided that the solver has adequate resolution, is able to handle all aspects of the helicopter problem, and sufficient computational resources are available to complete the design in a practical time-scale.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique for assessing environmental impacts in order to identify the key points of a process/product/service as well as suggesting alternatives to improve its environmental performance. The LCA methodology allows a ‘cradle-to-grave’ perspective, considering that all stages involved in the life cycle of a product or activity have a responsibility on the environmental consequences of it. Related terms such as life cycle engineering, social life cycle, and life cycle thinking are emerging with a wider perspective. In this article, an overview of the main aspects of the LCA methodology is provided. Application of LCA in food biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, biopolymers, biofuels, and waste management of the biodegradable fractions is reviewed. Not only the utility of LCA to biotechnological processes, but also its main limitations are presented. The current tendencies in the development of LCA highlight the need to update the tools applicable to different areas with the increasing demand for more accurate environmental information. The main footprints commonly used as LCA indicators have been combined recently with the final goal of obtaining a single indicator useful for decision-making. The interest in LCA for product design and the interactions of LCA with other environmental tools are also commented on.

KW  - Narrative
KW  - Quantum computing
AB  - We refer to serious entertainment using the hellenic term psychagogy which literally means ‘education of the soul’. Based on Aristotle’s definition of tragedy we define psychagogy as the enactment in a complete form of events that are inherently significant and their consequences are perceived in a deep and profound way. We then turn our attention to narration as one of the main forms of psychagogy. In order to capture subjective elements in the structure and dynamics of narratives we use concepts from quantum theory. We describe how the notions of superposition, entanglement, interference and measurement can be applied to represent beliefs, decisions and actions of the protagonists in a computational narrative event and pinpoint potential synergies between these two fields. We apply these ideas to alternative kinds of narratives such as aristotelic or metaleptic forms exploring issues related to plot interactivity and provide examples for each one of them. Finally, we describe the implementation of these ideas in a novel special-purpose language called QuNL for embedding quantum computational concepts in digital narratives.

KW  - Insight - prediction - active inference - ideas - heuristics - Aha - problem solving
AB  - Perhaps it is no accident that insight moments accompany some of humanity’s most important discoveries in science, medicine, and art. Here we propose that feelings of insight play a central role in (heuristically) selecting an idea from the stream of consciousness by capturing attention and eliciting a sense of intuitive confidence permitting fast action under uncertainty. The mechanisms underlying this Eureka heuristic are explained within an active inference framework. First, implicit restructuring via Bayesian reduction leads to a higher-order prediction error (i.e., the content of insight). Second, dopaminergic precision-weighting of the prediction error accounts for the intuitive confidence, pleasure, and attentional capture (i.e., the feeling of insight). This insight as precision account is consistent with the phenomenology, accuracy, and neural unfolding of insight, as well as its effects on belief and decision-making. We conclude by reflecting on dangers of the Eureka Heuristic, including the arising and entrenchment of false beliefs and the vulnerability of insights under psychoactive substances and misinformation.

AB  - Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly being applied to the drug-design process as a result of the development of novel algorithms, growing access, the falling cost of computation and the development of novel technologies for generating chemically and biologically relevant data. There has been recent progress in fields such as molecular de novo generation, synthetic route prediction and, to some extent, property predictions. Despite this, most research in these fields has focused on improving the accuracy of the technologies, rather than on quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions. Uncertainty quantification will become a key component in autonomous decision making and will be crucial for integrating machine learning and chemistry automation to create an autonomous design–make–test–analyse cycle. This review covers the empirical, frequentist and Bayesian approaches to uncertainty quantification, and outlines how they can be used for drug design. We also outline the impact of uncertainty quantification on decision making.

Here, I review some of the most common and popular methods to assess whether these apparent concerns are justified. I suggest that the field is approaching maturity and that some methods are capable of giving quantitative predictions, which are confirmed experimentally. This suggests that water-placement methods should be used more widely to help direct chemistry efforts, although more successful examples are required to help validate the techniques.

AB  - Decreasing the environmental impact, increasing the degree of social responsibility, and considering the economic motivations of organizations are three significant features in designing a reverse logistics network under sustainability respects. Developing a model, which can simultaneously consider these environmental, social, and economic aspects and their indicators, is an important problem for both researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we try to address this comprehensive approach by using indicators for measurement of aforementioned aspects and by applying fuzzy mathematical programming to design a multi-echelon multi-period multi-objective model for a sustainable reverse logistics network. To reflect all aspects of sustainability, we try to minimize the present value of costs, as well as environmental impacts, and optimize the social responsibility as objective functions of the model. In order to deal with uncertain parameters, fuzzy mathematical programming is used, and to obtain solutions on Pareto front, a customized multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is applied. The validity of the proposed solution procedure has been analyzed in small and large size test problems based on four comparison metrics and computational time using analysis of variance. Finally, in order to indicate the applicability of the suggested model and the practicality of the proposed solution procedure, the model has been implemented in a medical syringe recycling system. The results reveal that the suggested MOPSO algorithm overtakes epsilon-constraint method from the aspects of quality of the solutions as well as computational time. Proper use of the proposed process could help managers efficiently manage the flow of recycled products with regard to environmental and social considerations, and the process offers a sustainable competitive advantage to corporations.

We examine some 20 physical and mathematical models of computation that are either known or suspected to have super-Turing or hypercomputational capabilities, and argue that there is nothing in principle to prevent the physical implementation of hypercomputational systems. Hypercomputation may indeed be intrinsic to physics; recursion ‘emerges’ from hypercomputation in the same way that classical physics emerges from quantum theory as scale increases. Furthermore, even if hypercomputation were one day shown to be physically infeasible, there would still remain a role for hypercomputation as an organising principle for advanced research.

AB  - Incremental learning is an alternative approach for maintaining knowledge by utilizing previous computational results of dynamic data contexts. As a new and important part of incremental learning, incremental Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) is an emerging field of concerning evolution of object or attributes sets and dynamic knowledge processing in the dynamic big data. However, existing incremental CCL algorithms still face some challenges that improve the generalization ability of new concepts, and the previously acquired knowledge should be efficiently utilized to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. At the same time, formal concept analysis has become a potential direction of cognitive computing, which can describe the processes of CCL. Attribute topology (AT) as a new representation of formal concepts can clearly display the relationship between new data and original data for reducing the complexity of the CCL process; therefore, we present an incremental concept-cognitive algorithm based on AT for incremental concept calculation, which is expressed by a concept tree. First, a relationship between the new object and some of the original objects is established. Then, on the basis of this finding, we propose an algorithm for updating the concept and presenting them through a concept tree. The algorithm determines the position and subtree of the new object by the relationship between the object and the original objects. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate that the concept update algorithm based on AT is feasible and effective, and different orders of increments will result in different concept tree structures.

AB  - In this paper, the authors present research into autonomously responsive architectural systems that adapt to environmental changes using hygroscopic material properties. Instead of using superimposed layers of singular purpose mechanisms–for sensing, actuation, control and power–in the form of high-tech electronic equipment as is emblematic for current approaches to climate responsiveness in architecture, the presented research follows an integrative, no-tech strategy that can be considered to follow biological rather than mechanical principles. In nature plants employ different systems to respond to environmental changes. One particularly promising way is hygroscopic actuation, as it allows for metabolically independent movement and thus provides an interesting model for autonomous, passive and materially embedded responsiveness. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the parameters, variables and syntactic elements that enable the development of such meteorosensitive architectural systems based on the biomimetic transfer of the hygroscopic actuation of plant cones. It provides a summary of five years of research by the authors on architectural systems which utilize the hygroscopic qualities of wooden veneer as a naturally produced constituent within weather responsive composite systems, which is presented through an extensive analysis of research samples, prototypes at various scales, and two comprehensive case studies of full scale constructions.

Adopting a case study approach, five distinct and complementary types of analysis have been conducted: comprehensive sentiment analysis and topic modelling, an analysis using multiple thesauri, statistical analyses for hypothesis testing, and machine learning for classification. The methodological innovation, through the construction of thesauri, has enabled the measurement of sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioural dimensions in unique and emblematic attractions, experiences, and transportation within a tourist destination, based on visitor reviews. This new approach allows tourism professionals and destination managers to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to enhance tourist satisfaction. The findings suggest that there are significant differences in the relationships between specific dimensions and that gender and culture moderate or impact these relationships.

In the competitive environment several distributors are in competition and arriving to the customers earlier than other competitors affect amount of the sale. The main objectives are to minimize the travel cost and maximize the sale to serve customers before other rival distributors. To measuring the efficiency of the problem an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is proposed and it compared with an original PSO algorithm in terms of accuracy. Computational results indicate that the improved PSO algorithm performs well in terms of accuracy but the original PSO performs better in computational time.

AB  - Neuromodulatory signaling is generally considered broad in its impact across cortex. However, variations in the characteristics of cortical circuits may introduce regionally-specific responses to diffuse modulatory signals. Features such as patterns of axonal innervation, tissue tortuosity and molecular diffusion, effectiveness of degradation pathways, subcellular receptor localization, and patterns of receptor expression can lead to local modification of modulatory inputs. We propose that modulatory compartments exist in cortex and can be defined by variation in structural features of local circuits. Further, we argue that these compartments are responsible for local regulation of neuromodulatory tone. For the cholinergic system, these modulatory compartments are regions of cortical tissue within which signaling conditions for acetylcholine are relatively uniform, but between which signaling can vary profoundly. In the visual system, evidence for the existence of compartments indicates that cholinergic modulation likely differs across the visual pathway. We argue that the existence of these compartments calls for thinking about cholinergic modulation in terms of finer-grained control of local cortical circuits than is implied by the traditional view of this system as a diffuse modulator. Further, an understanding of modulatory compartments provides an opportunity to better understand and perhaps correct signal modifications that lead to pathological states.

AB  - This report addresses the development of experimental and computational estimations of the anisotropic elastic moduli (EM) of single crystals to aid in the a priori (i.e., starting with the crystal structure) prediction of the trend as a function of the direction of applied stress. Experimentally EM values in the normal direction to the X-, Y- and Z-planes of block shaped aspirin and acetaminophen crystals were determined using data generated by the newly designed compression stage housed in our powder X-ray diffractometer. Computational estimations of EM were made using the applicable modules in Material Studio® 5.5. The measured EM values normal to the (100), (020) and (002) planes of aspirin, and (20−1), (020) and (001) planes of acetaminophen crystals by both methods succeeded in detected the anisotropic behavior. However, disparity in the relative values between measured EM values by different techniques was observed. This may be attributed to deformation sources other than lattice compression including inelastic processes such as local failure and plasticity as well as deformation at the crystal–probe interfaces due to crystal surface roughness (asperities). The trend of the ratio of the values from the respective methods showed reasonable agreement and promise for the technique. The present approach demonstrated the suitability of the compression stage to determine and predict anisotropic EM of subjected small molecular organic crystals.

AB  - Epidemic processes take place in not only time but also space. Physical space is the domain in which the encounters that lie at the basis of epidemic dynamics takes place. If we are to understand infectious diseases beyond a trivial or hypothetical spatial configuration (such as the spread of a disease in a highly assortatively mixed closed unit like a hospital ward), we must entertain ways to quantitatively model spatial interactions. This may be accomplished in discrete or continuous spaces alike. In computational settings, discretization is the norm. For ease of use, continuous real spaces are often discretized into a grid or lattice. In addition, graphs can be used to mathematically expand and articulate a wider notion of “neighborhood” than what a lattice-confined model, such as a cellular automaton, could provide for. This chapter discusses the move from a simple discrete space lattice models to real-world geospatial applications of infectious disease dynamics.

AB  - Programming languages are, at the same time, instruments and communicative artifacts that evolve rapidly through use. In this paper I describe an online computing platform called BioBike. BioBike is a trading zone where biologists and programmers collaborate in the development of an extended vocabulary and functionality for computational genomics. In the course of this work they develop interactional expertise with one another’s domains. The extended BioBike vocabulary operates on two planes: as a working programming language, and as a pidgin in the conversation between the biologists and engineers. The flexibility that permits this community to dynamically extend BioBike’s working vocabulary—to form new pidgins—makes BioBike unique among computational tools, which usually are not themselves adapted through the collaborations that they facilitate. Thus BioBike is itself a crucial feature—which it is tempting to refer to as a participant—in the developing interaction.

AB  - Given a set S of n points in the plane and a fixed angle 0<ω<π, we show how to find in O(nlogn) time all triangles of minimum area with one angle ω that enclose S. We prove that in general, the solution cannot be written without cubic roots. We also prove an Ω(nlogn) lower bound for this problem in the algebraic computation tree model. If the input is a convex n-gon, our algorithm takes Θ(n) time.

AB  - The different software modules (e.g., components) that constitute a system are not isolated entities. In fact, they need to interact according to a certain coordination protocol in order to achieve a common goal. This coordination protocol crosscuts the different software modules, hindering their reusability, independence, maintenance and evolution, but these drawbacks can be solved by separating coordination from computations and encapsulating coordination outside the components that perform computations. Aspect-Oriented Programming has been demonstrated to be an interesting technology for handling certain crosscutting concerns, such as coordination. This paper explains how coordination protocols can be implemented outside computational modules using general purpose aspect-oriented programming languages.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of understanding and constructing intelligent machines that are human-like (or more intelligent than humans). Simulation of AI approaches should be classified as emulation of human brains. Methods and procedures of analysis should be used to recognize and utilize cognitive processes. We provide examples of both the history of AI and the most recent breakthroughs in AI so that readers can get a sense of both. This chapter also describes advances in AI applications. Neural networks, evolutionary computing, logic-based reasoning, knowledge representation, rule-based systems, and pattern recognition are briefly introduced. Additionally, we have discussed how AI is being used in a variety of cutting-edge multidisciplinary applications, including industry 4.0 and the AI revolution, explainable AI, recommender systems, and their integration with AI. Additionally, the chapter looks at the advantages and disadvantages of AI. Because AI has so many diverse applications, there is a discussion over its benefits and risks. This chapter also discusses future scope and ethics-related projects.

AB  - Advances in large language model (LLM) technology enable chatbots to generate and analyze content for our work. Generative chatbots do this work by predicting responses rather than knowing the meaning of their responses. In other words, chatbots can produce coherent-sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content, referred to as hallucinations. When humans uncritically use this untruthful content, it becomes what we call botshit. This article focuses on how to use chatbots for content generation work while mitigating the epistemic (i.e., the process of producing knowledge) risks associated with botshit. Drawing on risk management research, we introduce a typology framework that orients how chatbots can be used based on two dimensions: response veracity verifiability and response veracity importance. The framework identifies four modes of chatbot work (authenticated, autonomous, automated, and augmented) with a botshit-related risk (ignorance, miscalibration, routinization, and black boxing). We describe and illustrate each mode and offer advice to help chatbot users guard against the botshit risks that come with each mode.

AB  - Cooperation occurs at all stages of human life and is necessary for small groups and large-scale societies alike to emerge and thrive. This chapter bridges research in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, neuroeconomics, and social psychology to help understand group cooperation. We present a value-based framework for understanding cooperation, integrating neuroeconomic models of decision-making with psychological and situational variables involved in cooperative behavior, particularly in groups. According to our framework, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex serves as a neural integration hub for value computation during cooperative decisions, receiving inputs from various neuro-cognitive processes such as attention, affect, memory, and learning. We describe factors that directly or indirectly shape the value of cooperation decisions, including cultural contexts and social norms, personal and social identity, and intergroup relations. We also highlight the role of economic, social, and cultural institutions in shaping cooperative behavior. We discuss the implications for future research on cooperation.

AB  - In the intensely developing information society, the education of pre-service teachers presents an organisational, methodological, and conceptual challenge. Recent years have necessitated reflection on the content and modalities of the formation of digital competence in pre-service teachers. This article – considers which components the digital competences of the new generations of teachers should contain and how this area can be effectively developed within academic education. The article is the result of interviews conducted with 35 experts (recognized scholars in the field of media pedagogy) from North and South America, Africa, Australia and Oceania, Asia, and Europe. Qualitative interviews using the Delphi methodology were conducted between June and September 2022. Using grounded theory principles, it was noted that there is a need to modify pre-service teachers' curricula in the following areas: creating, retrieving and managing digital content; integrating ICT into subject content; developing soft skills; enhancing interactivity in the classroom; social aspects of ICT; distance learning; new socio-technical processes; advanced digital competencies; predictive learning; analysing the impact of ICT on human life; data protection; e-risks; low digital competencies; understanding media messaging; and supporting people with disabilities.

In addition, we illustrate the importance of considering the confidence of the answers, and show how ambiguity may be used as a guide for the automatic adjustment of the problem representation. To our knowledge, this is the first published account of a computational model's attempt at the entire Raven's test suite.

The research method includes the pre-test and the final test in the form of a quiz, with questions addressed to players to determine the improvement achieved after playing the game “Miryoku” for five days. The Android-based SpeechRecognizer API will be implemented as the core of the algorithm. Data collection was carried out using the distribution of a survey form to 31 participants with minimal skills in Japanese and or who wish to learn Japanese. The result was an increase in the average score obtained by the participants from 64.77 out of 100 on the initial test to a score of 87.77 out of 100 on the final test. It can be concluded that game media is in demand and effective for learning Japanese as seen from the improvement.

AB  - Designing with building performance simulation feedback in the early design stage has existed since the early days of computational modeling. However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages.

In this review, we highlight work that uses network-level approaches to shed light on key innovations in ancient life, including the emergence of proto-metabolic networks, collective autocatalysis and bioenergetics coupling. Recent experiments and computational analyses have revealed new aspects of this ancient history, paving the way for the use of large datasets to further improve our understanding of life's principles and abiogenesis.

Mirowski's proposed alterative is called into question on the basis of two crucial weaknesses. First there is Mirowksi's penchant for what Polanyi has called Laplacian reductionism. Second there is Mirowski's inability to develop a comprehensive and consistent theory of evolutionary economics. Mirowski's work is questioned in terms of what social theorists call the ‘structuration paradox’.

AB  - The worldview on environmentalism has evolved significantly from traditional environmental concerns to the emergence of some new concepts, such as the limit to the human ability and the balance of nature. Transport policymakers may pose a question of whether this new way of thinking has an effect on mode choice. However, a clear answer to this question has not been found. Similarly, the intuitive expectation that physical activity can be a motivation for the selection of more physically active travel modes has not been well documented. This study attempts to investigate the potential influences of the ecological view on environmentalism and attitude towards physical activity on mode choice. The analytic data comes from a sample of 821 respondents with 1840 reported trips in an online survey conducted in Nagoya, Japan in 2018. The postulated effects were investigated in the framework of an integrated choice and latent variable model and a latent class choice model. The estimates from our models showed that environmentalism had a positive effect on the share of rail though its effect on class assignment, and attitude towards physical activity had a positive effect on both utilities and shares of bicycling and walking. In addition, findings from our study signified the importance of heterogeneity treatments in mode choice models with latent variables.

AB  - In all areas of cancer therapy, resistance is a major problem and eventually leads to relapse of the disease. A variety of biological mechanisms have been reported that contribute to the resistance phenotype in cancer, including genetic mutations. The development of approaches to combat or overcome resistance depends on a thorough understanding of the principles according to which drug resistant phenotypes emerge and evolve. Mathematical oncology has made a number of important contributions to our understanding of the drivers of resistance. The emergence of resistance is an evolutionary process, and thus its mathematical/computational modeling can be informed by the rich methodology developed in the context of evolutionary biology. This article concentrates on showing how mathematical models can drive progress in advancing our understanding of resistance evolution in cancer, and how it might help us with progress in the clinic.

AB  - Abstract concepts are a powerful tool for making wide-ranging predictions in new situations based on little experience. Whereas looking-time studies suggest an early emergence of this ability in human infancy, other paradigms like the relational match to sample task often fail to detect abstract concepts until late preschool years. Similarly, non-human animals show difficulties and often succeed only after long training regimes. Given the considerable influence of slight task modifications, the conclusiveness of these findings for the development and phylogenetic distribution of abstract reasoning is debated. Here, we tested the abilities of 3 to 5-year-old children, chimpanzees, and capuchin monkeys in a unified and more ecologically valid task design based on the concept of “overhypotheses” (Goodman, 1955). Participants sampled high- and low-valued items from containers that either each offered items of uniform value or a mix of high- and low-valued items. In a test situation, participants should switch away earlier from a container offering low-valued items when they learned that, in general, items within a container are of the same type, but should stay longer if they formed the overhypothesis that containers bear a mix of types. We compared each species' performance to the predictions of a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model forming overhypotheses at a first and second level of abstraction, adapted to each species' reward preferences. Children and, to a more limited extent, chimpanzees demonstrated their sensitivity to abstract patterns in the evidence. In contrast, capuchin monkeys did not exhibit conclusive evidence for the ability of abstract knowledge formation

AB  - Organizations are increasingly leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze and resolve complex problems. This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape.

AB  - Since cloud computing has been developing as a successful business and growing interest of organizations to make use of the environment, the volume of provided services is highly demanding. Cloud computing environment has high maintenance costs, therefore, the resources are limited; due to rapid progress and the highly demanded volume of utilization of resources, ascertaining an appropriate approach for controlling and managing resources has become essential in this area. Therefore, an algorithm must be designed to perform better in all QoS. A significant factor in current exploratory methods is that each method owns distinctive features and perhaps does not estimate all QoSes. For example, one specific method has low energy consumption but does not consider SLA violation. Concerning the aims of the present study, the granular model is designed which uses various criteria involved in computations; in practice, by entering the values given in the past and discovering the relationships among them, the most desirable classification is produced. The membership function and the inference rule are derived from the data provided by the actual workload. Experimental analysis of the results showed that this method works out better than all other related methods and avails consistent performance in all QoS criteria.

AB  - The development of digital design and fabrication technologies is enabling an expanding inter-relationship between technology and design. Material-based design is defined as a computational informing process that enhances the integration between structure, material, and form within the logic of fabrication technologies. The term informed tectonics is introduced as a central concept in material-based design. The current research aim is to formulate taxonomy based on a series of selected case studies embedded in the context of current knowledge. The taxonomy is derived from observations and critical analysis of case studies. Through the comparative analysis of selected case studies of material-based design in research and practice, conceptual models processes and principles have been identified and formulated.

AB  - Background and objective
Alzheimer’s disease accounts for approximately 70% of all dementia cases. Cortical and hippocampal atrophy caused by Alzheimer’s disease can be appreciated easily from a T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance scan. Since a timely therapeutic intervention during the initial stages of the syndrome has a positive impact on both disease progression and quality of life of affected subjects, Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis is crucial. Thus, this study relies on the development of a robust yet lightweight 3D framework, Brain-on-Cloud, dedicated to efficient learning of Alzheimer’s disease-related features from 3D structural magnetic resonance whole-brain scans by improving our recent convolutional long short-term memory-based framework with the integration of a set of data handling techniques in addition to the tuning of the model hyper-parameters and the evaluation of its diagnostic performance on independent test data.
Methods
For this objective, four serial experiments were conducted on a scalable GPU cloud service. They were compared and the hyper-parameters of the best experiment were tuned until reaching the best-performing configuration. In parallel, two branches were designed. In the first branch of Brain-on-Cloud, training, validation and testing were performed on OASIS-3. In the second branch, unenhanced data from ADNI-2 were employed as independent test set, and the diagnostic performance of Brain-on-Cloud was evaluated to prove its robustness and generalization capability. The prediction scores were computed for each subject and stratified according to age, sex and mini mental state examination.
Results
In its best guise, Brain-on-Cloud is able to discriminate Alzheimer’s disease with an accuracy of 92% and 76%, sensitivity of 94% and 82%, and area under the curve of 96% and 92% on OASIS-3 and independent ADNI-2 test data, respectively.
Conclusions
Brain-on-Cloud shows to be a reliable, lightweight and easily-reproducible framework for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease from 3D structural magnetic resonance whole-brain scans, performing well without segmenting the brain into its portions. Preserving the brain anatomy, its application and diagnostic ability can be extended to other cognitive disorders. Due to its cloud nature, computational lightness and fast execution, it can also be applied in real-time diagnostic scenarios providing prompt clinical decision support.

AB  - For a large part of its history cognitive science has been grounded in views of the mind based on the traditional Cartesian dualisms. These dichotomies have been reinforced in particular by the view of the mind as an encased symbol-processing system “protected from the external world” (Newell, A., Rosenbloom, P. S., & Laird J. E. (1990). Symbolic architectures for cognition. In M.I. Posner (Ed.), Foundations of cognitive science, Cambridge, MA: Bradford Books/MIT Press, pp. 93–131:107). Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) seeks to supersede Cartesianism, thinking about cognition and culture as mutually constitutive of each other. This approach analyzes thought processes as embedded in and manifested through systems of historically developing, culturally mediated activity. Consequently for CHAT, a basic unit for the study of human thought is joint mediated activity. In this paper we will discuss an example of research that follows the CHAT approach to the analysis of learning and development. The data sample is taken from a session of the Fifth Dimension, an after-school activity designed to implement CHAT principles in order to promote the cognitive and social development of adult and child participants alike.

AB  - The integration of big data technology in the manufacturing process has become a norm, and as society's dependence on the digital economy increases, colleges and universities must adjust their teaching methods to cater to their students' needs. In evaluating the success of business-school partnerships, there is a need for common criteria and visualising data analysis results. However, the current educational approach presents some challenges, including a lack of practical experience with software, overemphasis on theoretical concepts, and inadequate training in problem-oriented statistical modeling and big data statistics projects. Industry-education cooperation should be leveraged to enhance the implementation of big data technology and promote its overall development. This paper analyses the shortcomings of traditional talent training models in higher education and proposes incorporating industrial education to address the gaps. The paper aims to bridge the industry-education gap by developing and implementing an Inter-Technology Information Management (ITIM) system for quality education. The ITIM system uses a fuzzy algorithm to evaluate the quality of education and provides various intelligent functional modules, such as group management, financial management, and process-to-process communication. Compared to other integration models, the proposed management system offers superior performance with an industrial education performance accuracy of 98%, an average analysis, and calculation time of 20 ms and a maximum performance efficiency of 98%.By incorporating dynamic analysis of industry education, the experimental results of the talent training model have led to improvements in teaching effectiveness, student learning, and theoretical-applied teaching quality.

A socio-ecological lens enables examination of multi-level influences within the religious practice of tithing (giving 10% of one’s earnings to the church). Distal influences (e.g., tax law) and proximal influences (e.g., norms for payment, parental practices) are investigated to explain the emergence of mathematical problems during the practice of tithing. Exploration of children’s success and strategy use as a function of problem context found differential success and strategy use when children solved problems of tithing, as compared to a mathematically similar school context. This research demonstrates how proximal and distal factors can illuminate the contours of everyday mathematical performance.

This study aimed to identify industry expectations towards the industrial metaverse. A questionnaire was sent to 18 companies to collect their views on potential industrial metaverse use cases and possible challenges that may occur. The companies identified use cases under eight thematic groups: remote operation and maintenance, sales and marketing, training, guidance and support, knowledge sharing and collaboration, novel services and business opportunities, and flexible utilization and workforce availability. Companies pointed out that challenges in using the metaverse may originate from technology acceptance, technology maturity, data governance, regulations and standards, cyber security and safety and cost. These findings provide company perspective on the industrial metaverse discussion and can be used when researching the topic and developing metaverse solutions further.

AB  - Iceland features a high share of renewable energy supply but remains largely dependent on fossil fuels for transport and is relatively car dependent for mobility. In the context of a public transport system perceived by users and non-users as inadequate, we document individuals' corresponding micro-stories and show how these constrain their ‘functionings’ within a mobility capabilities perspective. We then show how this relates to a set of mobility justice principles, informing inferences for a more just and inclusive transition to decarbonised mobility. While acknowledging that the country has a pattern of urbanisation and challenging terrain that help to explain the limitations of its public transport system, we nonetheless argue that additional investment and policy measures will be required to address transport poverty. For data, we draw on analysis of Icelandic bus routes, focus groups with representative public, and interviews with vulnerable individuals. We find that transport decarbonisation policy needs to account for existing material poverty and be far more equitable if a just transition to low-carbon mobility is achieved. We also reveal how mobility justice issues interact with other dimensions of justice such as distributive, procedural, cosmopolitan, restorative, and recognition.

AB  - Distinct photoactive material compositions have been investigated starting from the mid-70s to reduce energy and pollution associated with ammonia synthesis. Hitherto, photocatalysts suffer from low ammonia yield and incomprehensive understanding of the mechanisms. The target of this research is to develop a systematic and comprehensive approach to screen and design durable and efficient metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts to drive the photofixation of nitrogen at atmospheric conditions. This work discusses the available databases in the context of photocatalysis for the first time and reviews essential descriptors by incorporating Quantum Mechanics and molecular simulation techniques, taking into consideration sustainability aspects. As a result of a study on Hypothetical MOFs, Zn3(BTC)2(C6H5) has shown to satisfy the requirement for photofixation of nitrogen, using hydrogen and nitrogen as inputs, to ammonia. Comparison between Zn3(BTC)2(C6H5) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) has been made based on geometrical, bandgap, diffusion coefficients, adsorption properties and life cycle assessment analysis of the production phase.

AB  - A highly effective method for controlling the spread of an infectious disease is vaccination. However, there are many situations where vaccines are in limited supply. The ability to determine, under this constraint, a vaccination strategy which minimises the number of people that become infected over the course of a potential epidemic is essential. Two questions naturally arise: when is it best to allocate vaccines, and to whom should they be allocated? We address these questions in the context of metapopulation models of disease spread. We discover that in practice it is generally optimal to distribute all vaccines prophylactically, rather than withholding until infection is introduced. For small metapopulations, we provide a method for determining the optimal prophylactic allocation. As the optimal strategy becomes computationally intensive to obtain when the population size increases, we detail an approximation method to determine an approximately optimal vaccination scheme. We find that our approximate strategy is consistently at least as good as three strategies reported in the literature across a wide range of parameter values.

AB  - Determining the relative pose between the object and the camera using 2D to 3D point correspondences is one of key problems in photogrammetry and the accuracy and speed of its computation is very important. A fast iterative algorithm to solve the problem is proposed in this article. The algorithm formulates objective function to minimize the object-space collinearity error. Then the optimal translation vector is computed in terms of rotation matrix. Finally the optimal rotation matrix is estimated by applying a new absolute orientation method which is also proposed in this article. The new absolute orientation method uses the Fobenius norm, determinant and adjoint of matrix to formulate the closed-form optimal estimation of the rotation matrix, instead of the popular SVD-based method. Empirical results suggest the proposed algorithm performs the same accuracy and noise-resistance with extremely fast speed compared with the current employed algorithms.

The current and ongoing challenges brought on by climate change will require future scientists who have hands-on experience using advanced molecular techniques, can work with large data sets, and can make correlations between metadata and microbial diversity. A course-embedded research project can prepare students to answer complex research questions that might help plants adapt to climate change. The project described herein uses plants as a host to study the impact of climate change-induced drought on host-microbe interactions through next-generation DNA sequencing and analysis using a command-line program. Specifically, the project studies the impact of simulated drought on the rhizosphere microbiome of Fast Plants rapid cycling Brassica rapa using inexpensive greenhouse supplies and 16S rRNA V3/V4 Illumina sequencing. Data analysis is performed with the freely accessible Python-based microbiome bioinformatics platform QIIME 2.

AB  - Uncertainty is an important consideration in topology optimization to produce robust and reliable solutions. There are several possibilities to take into account the uncertainty in the topology optimization of continuum structures. In this paper, we assume that the only source of uncertainty is the variability of the applied load directions. Most models in this area apply parametric statistical tools to describe the directional uncertainty of the applied loads to produce robust structures which are insensitive to the directional uncertainty as much as possible. In the most popular parametric statistical approach the expected-compliance, based on the directional normality assumption, is used as the preferred measure of robustness. We will proof indirectly that this approach is far from the engineering practice and may give hardly interpretable or totally misleading results, which will be demonstrated by two carefully selected counter-examples. The counter-examples validate the fact that the expected-compliance, as a statistical abstraction based on more or less theoretical assumption about normality, not a general applicable measure of robustness. It will be shown, that the non-parametric and really robust volume-constrained worst-load-direction-oriented minimax-compliance model, used in this paper only as a proofing tool in a very simple form, is a viable alternative of the parametric expected-compliance model and its results and its problem solving process as a whole are very close to the engineering thinking. The worst-load-direction-oriented minimax-compliance-model provides expressive, rigorous, generally applicable, and objective information about the robustness. The parametric expected-compliance in itself as the preferred measure of robustness is unable to characterize the compliance variability, in contrast of the minimax approach which can be describe the compliance variability by a robust range-like measure computed very easily as the difference of the maximal- and minimal-compliance on the set of the feasible loading directions.

AB  - The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) system, a modeling and simulation tool, offers certain advantages for studying water systems. These systems are modeled as a collection of supply, demand, and transmission entities. Domain experts can construct whole water system models from template model parts (entities) with built-in constraints for combining them. The parameterized entities are simulated with the aid of textual and visual experiment set-ups. A set of scripts are provided for reading and writing data in entities. Lack of access to the source code of these model entities makes using integrating them other kinds of models more difficult. This is a crucial restriction since modeling water systems increasingly need to be used with the models, for example, energy and food systems to improve understanding and predictions of water supply and demand policies. Given the significance of combining water system models with other types of models, this paper proposes developing a Componentized-WEAP (C-WEAP) by embedding the WEAP system in a RESTful framework. The water system entities are mapped to meta-components using the Ecore modeling methodology. Each meta-component is paired with its concrete counterpart in the WEAP system. A complete set of meta-components for the entities is developed. An existing water system model is developed in the C-WEAP RESTful framework. The simulation of this water system demonstrates the computational cost of the proposed framework is negligible. The developed C-WEAP RESTful framework promotes integrating it with other software systems.

AB  - Recent tumor genome sequencing confirmed that one tumor often consists of multiple cell subpopulations (clones) which bear different, but related, genetic profiles such as mutation and copy number variation profiles. Thus far, one tumor has been viewed as a whole entity in cancer functional studies. With the advances of genome sequencing and computational analysis, we are able to quantify and computationally dissect clones from tumors, and then conduct clone-based analysis. Emerging technologies such as single-cell genome sequencing and RNA-Seq could profile tumor clones. Thus, we should reconsider how to conduct cancer systems biology studies in the genome sequencing era. We will outline new directions for conducting cancer systems biology by considering that genome sequencing technology can be used for dissecting, quantifying and genetically characterizing clones from tumors. Topics discussed in Part 1 of this review include computationally quantifying of tumor subpopulations; clone-based network modeling, cancer hallmark-based networks and their high-order rewiring principles and the principles of cell survival networks of fast-growing clones.

AB  - Over the past decade neuroscience has been attacking the problem of cognition with increasing vigor. Yet, what exactly is cognition, beyond a general signifier of anything seemingly complex the brain does? Here, we briefly review attempts to define, describe, explain, build, enhance and experience cognition. We highlight perspectives including psychology, molecular biology, computation, dynamical systems, machine learning, behavior and phenomenology. This survey of the landscape reveals not a clear target for explanation but a pluralistic and evolving scene with diverse opportunities for grounding future research. We argue that rather than getting to the bottom of it, over the next century, by deconstructing and redefining cognition, neuroscience will and should expand rather than merely reduce our concept of the mind.

AB  - The more detailed and accurate earth observation has been made driven by the progress of satellites and sensors optical photography technology, which poses both an opportunity and a challenge to small object segmentation task. However, the inherent difficulty and inadequate consideration still make small object segmentation task inevitably encounter a performance gain bottleneck. We analyze the longstanding but underestimated challenges in this task and give a peer-to-peer solution to response them. Specifically, we design a dual-branch awareness structure dedicated to small object segmentation, named Pos-DANet, which is composed with a small object activation branch and a fuzzy refinement branch. The small object activation branch is used to aware the small objects and avoid the negative influence of redundant background. The fuzzy refinement branch utilizes the fuzzy modeling to improve the segmentation accuracy of small objects. These two branches work collaboratively to make the whole structure to focus more on small objects and achieve satisfying segmentation results. Finally, we propose a hierarchical unbiased loss to eliminate the bias against small objects in the regression process. Extensive experiments demonstrated that Pos-DANet exhibits a higher qualitative and quantitative performance than the advanced methods within small objects, which achieves the best results in mIoU (71.12 %, 83.33 %) and sIoU (63.23 %, 68.89 %) on two datasets.

AB  - Since emerging in 2009, cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have captured the imaginations of many investors and users in accumulating private wealth detached from government control and oversight. This article examines how the rise of bitcoin has particular geographies and trajectories of uneven development across the globe. The generation (or ‘mining’) of cryptocurrencies is computationally-intensive, requiring computer hardware, cool air and cheap energy. Adopting the case study of Quebec, Canada, we show how these variables interact to produce a relationship between digital currencies, economic imaginaries and space in the regions where cryptomining is clustered. We argue that these new geographies of cryptocurrency ‘mining’ leave residual marks on the regions where they are located but remain highly mobile – moving from location to location in search of the cheap energy that supports private accumulation. Adopting an illustrative case study of Quebec, Canada, we work to render visible the materiality of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Far from existing both nowhere and everywhere, the generation of bitcoin is foregrounded in local contexts and regional economic imaginaries with both spatial and social implications for the cities and towns where cryptomining takes place. We conclude with a call for further research into this emergent ‘crypto-regionalism’ and its consequences.

AB  - In recent years, schizophrenia research has focused on inhibitory interneuron dysfunction at the level of neurobiology and on cognitive impairments at the psychological level. Reviewing both experimental and computational findings, we show how the temporal structure of the activity of neuronal populations, exemplified by brain rhythms, can begin to bridge these levels of complexity. Oscillations in neuronal activity tie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia to alterations in local processing and large-scale coordination, and these alterations in turn can lead to the cognitive and perceptual disturbances observed in schizophrenia.

AB  - We review recent progress on the information paradox. We explain why exponentially small correlations in the radiation emitted by a black hole are sufficient to resolve the original paradox put forward by Hawking. We then describe a refinement of the paradox that makes essential reference to the black-hole interior. This analysis leads to a broadly-applicable physical principle: in a theory of quantum gravity, a copy of all the information on a Cauchy slice is also available near the boundary of the slice. This principle can be made precise and established – under weak assumptions, and using only low-energy techniques – in asymptotically global AdS and in four dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. When applied to black holes, this principle tells us that the exterior of the black hole always retains a complete copy of the information in the interior. We show that accounting for this redundancy provides a resolution of the information paradox for evaporating black holes and, conversely, that ignoring this redundancy leads to paradoxes even in the absence of black holes. We relate this perspective to recent computations of the Page curve for holographic CFTs coupled to nongravitational baths. But we argue that such models may provide an inaccurate picture of the rate at which information can be extracted from evaporating black holes in asymptotically flat space. We discuss large black holes dual to typical states in AdS/CFT and the new paradoxes that arise in this setting. These paradoxes also extend to the eternal black hole. They can be resolved by assuming that the map between the boundary CFT and the black-hole interior is state dependent. We discuss the consistency of state-dependent bulk reconstructions. We conclude by examining the viability of arguments for firewalls, fuzzballs and other kinds of structure at the horizon.

AB  - To enhance the performance of classical neural networks, a quantum-inspired neural networks model based on the controlled-Hadamard gates is proposed. In this model, the inputs are discrete sequences described by a matrix where the number of rows is equal to the number of input nodes, and the number of columns is equal to the sequence length. This model includes three layers, in which the hidden layer consists of quantum neurons, and the output layer consists of classical neurons. The quantum neuron consists of the quantum rotation gates and the multi-qubits controlled-Hadamard gates. A learning algorithm is presented in detail according to the basic principles of quantum computation. The characteristics of input sequence can be effectively obtained from both breadth and depth. The experimental results show that, when the number of input nodes is closer to the sequence length, the proposed model is obviously superior to the BP neural networks.

AB  - We provide an expository account, from the viewpoint of geographic information science, of oriented matroids. The importance of these structures is that they provide an approach to space which is discrete and hence can be used for robust computation. A finite set of points in the plane can be given the structure of an oriented matroid and this finite structure captures enough of the geometrical structure of the idealized continuous plane to be able to perform useful computations such as finding the convex hull of a subset of the points. The advantage of oriented matroids over some approaches to discrete space, such as Schneider’s realms, is that they are purely finite combinatorial structures that make no mention of Rn or Qn, even though the intended models are finite subsets of these spaces.

AB  - The quantum theory of atoms in molecules, QTAIM, is used to identify atoms in molecules, AIM, and quantify their interactions through the partitioning of molecule into atomic basins in the real space and it is confined only to the purely electronic systems composed of electrons as quantum particles and the nuclei as clamped point charges. The extended version of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM, MC-QTAIM, bypasses this border and makes it possible to identify AIM and quantify their interactions in systems composed of multiple quantum particles that electrons may or may not be one of their components opening a new door for the analysis of the exotic AIM and bonds. In this contribution, two conjectures, called the Bader conjecture, BC, and the extended Bader conjecture, EBC, are proposed as the cornerstones of the real-space partitioning of a molecule into atomic basins within the context of the QTAIM and the MC-QTAIM, respectively. A literature survey on various few-body quantum systems composed of quarks, nucleons, and elementary particles like muons and positrons is also done unraveling the fact that in all these diverse systems there are unambiguous cases of clusterizations. These clustered systems, irrespective to their components, behave as if they are molecules composed of some kind of atoms, instead of being an amorphous mixture of quantum particles. In the case of the muonic and the positronic molecules, computational studies reveal that the AIM structures of these systems are well-captured by the EBC. Beyond identifying atomic basins, both QTAIM and MC-QTAIM attribute properties to AIM, which is their share from the molecular expectation values of quantum observables. It is demonstrated that not only the share from the average value of an observable may be attributed to an atomic basin but also the fluctuation of each basin property is also quantifiable.

AB  - This study has several objectives. Firstly, the authors adopt a scoping review of extant research to identify common emerging themes in the ChatGPT model. Secondly, the manuscript explores the emerging innovation and knowledge management challenges by problematizing gaps that need to be explored. This study setting comprises a comprehensive scoping review and analysis of the ChatGPT and related literature. Based on a substantive content analysis of 652 articles between the years 2018 and 2023, four themes emerged from the literature that present gaps to be explored in future research. The technology acceptance model (TAM) grounds the theoretical framework to explore the emerging themes and potential user satisfaction criteria. In addition, this is the first study to broaden the TAM innovation literature by applying knowledge generation criteria to assess the extent to which ChatGPT would satisfy expected user sensemaking represented by know-that, know-how, know-why, and care-why knowledge. Two research questions assessed the findings against TAM and knowledge generation criteria. Based on the emerging gaps identified, the review found that by applying TAM, user satisfaction is not expected to be high especially when applied in educational settings given specific learner needs in complex learning situations. While aspects of user knowledge is expected to increase exponentially, the quality of the information generated by ChatGPT is not expected to result in high user know-why knowledge and complex system understanding. At a time when generative AI models are challenging traditional scientific means of delivering education pedagogy in driving student and user learning, this study has important implications for the future of the ChatGPT model application within educational and broader settings.

AB  - Attaching meaning to arbitrary symbols (i.e. words) is a complex and lengthy process. In the case of numbers, it was previously suggested that this process is grounded on two early pre-verbal systems for numerical quantification: the approximate number system (ANS or ‘analogue magnitude’), and the object tracking system (OTS or ‘parallel individuation’), which children are equipped with before symbolic learning. Each system is based on dedicated neural circuits, characterized by specific computational limits, and each undergoes a separate developmental trajectory. Here, I review the available cognitive and neuroscientific data and argue that the available evidence is more consistent with a crucial role for the ANS, rather than for the OTS, in the acquisition of abstract numerical concepts that are uniquely human.

AB  - In the theoretical analysis of the physical basis of computation there is a great deal of confusion and controversy (e.g., on the existence of hyper-computers). First, we present a methodology for making a theoretical analysis of computation by physical systems. We focus on the construction and analysis of simple examples that are models of simple sub-theories of physical theories. Then we illustrate the methodology by presenting a simple example for Newtonian Kinematics, and a critique that leads to a substantial extension of the methodology. The example proves that for any set A of natural numbers there exists a 3-dimensional Newtonian kinematic system MA, with an infinite family of particles Pn whose total mass is bounded, and whose observable behaviour can decide whether or not n∈A for all n∈N in constant time. In particular, the example implies that simple Newtonian kinematic systems that are bounded in space, time, mass and energy can compute all possible sets and functions on discrete data. The system is a form of marble run and is a model of a small fragment of Newtonian Kinematics. Next, we use the example to extend the methodology. The marble run shows that a formal theory for computation by physical systems needs strong conditions on the notion of experimental procedure and, specifically, on methods for the construction of equipment. We propose to extend the methodology by defining languages to express experimental procedures and the construction of equipment. We conjecture that the functions computed by experimental computation in Newtonian Kinematics are “equivalent” to those computed by algorithms, i.e. the partial computable functions.
