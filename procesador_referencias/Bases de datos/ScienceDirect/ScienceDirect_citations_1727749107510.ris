AB  - Acquisition of knowledge must be interwoven with the process of applying it. However, traditional training methods which provide abstract knowledge have shown ineffective for gaining experience of the work. In order to solve this problem, more and more researchers have included narrative in simulation, which is known as narrative simulation. By providing the narratives, participants recognize the choices, decisions, and experience that lead to the consequences of those decisions. It has been proven that narrative simulation is very useful in facilitating in-depth learning and reflective learning. However, conventional methods of data collection and narrative construction for narrative simulation are labor intensive and time consuming. They make use of previous narratives manually and directly. They are inadequate to cope with the fast moving world where knowledge is changing rapidly. In order to provide a way for facilitating the construction of narrative simulation, a novel computational narrative construction method is proposed. By incorporating technologies of knowledge-based system (KBS), computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the proposed method provides an efficient and effective way for collecting narratives and automating the construction of narratives. The method converts the unstructured narratives into a structural representation for abstraction and facilitating computing processing. Moreover, it constructs the narratives that combine multiple narratives into a single narrative by applying a forecasting algorithm. The proposed method was successfully implemented in early intervention in mental health care of a social service company in Hong Kong since the case records in that process have structural similarities to narrative. The accuracies of data conversion and predictive function were measured based on recall and precision and encouraging results were obtained. High recall and precision are achieved in the data conversion function, and high recall for the predictive function when new concepts are excluded. The results show that it is possible for converting multiple narratives into a single narrative automatically. Based on the approach, it helps to stimulate knowledge workers to explore new problem solving methods so as to increase the quality of their solutions.

AB  - We develop a conceptual framework for collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing, providing systematic guidance for how human marketers and consumers can team up with AI, which has profound implications for retailing, which is the interface between marketers and consumers. Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. Marketers should optimize the mix and timing of AI-HI marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between AI and HI strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence.

AB  - Although solutions based on artificial and computational intelligence have made life easier, the fast development of technology also raises questions about near future and log term human cognition and social interaction. Through a survey of the literature and qualitative analysis, our work examined current research on how the AI/CI affects human cognitive functions and social interactions. We discuss how AI and CI are influencing e.g. how we humans gather information, build relationships, and communicate with others, with and without the new frontline technologies. Additionally, proposals for future advances are discussed along with the ethical and societal ramifications these technologies have, could and might bring into our lives. We think that by developing a deeper knowledge of how AI/CI affects human cognition and social interaction, new contributions are made to a positive conversation and encourage a responsible approach to incorporating new technologies into our daily lives.

AB  - The workshop “Bioinformatics for Biotechnology Applications (HavanaBioinfo 2012)”, held December 8–11, 2012 in Havana, aimed at exploring new bioinformatics tools and approaches for large-scale proteomics, genomics and chemoinformatics. Major conclusions of the workshop include the following: (i) development of new applications and bioinformatics tools for proteomic repository analysis is crucial; current proteomic repositories contain enough data (spectra/identifications) that can be used to increase the annotations in protein databases and to generate new tools for protein identification; (ii) spectral libraries, de novo sequencing and database search tools should be combined to increase the number of protein identifications; (iii) protein probabilities and FDR are not yet sufficiently mature; (iv) computational proteomics software needs to become more intuitive; and at the same time appropriate education and training should be provided to help in the efficient exchange of knowledge between mass spectrometrists and experimental biologists and bioinformaticians in order to increase their bioinformatics background, especially statistics knowledge.

AB  - Almost all design problems in the sciences and engineering can be formulated as optimization problems, and many image processing problems can also be related to or formulated as optimization problems. These optimization problems can be solved by optimization techniques. However, these problems are often highly nonlinear and are subject to multiple nonlinear constraints, which makes them very challenging to solve. The further complication to these challenges is the stringent time requirements and high dimensionality, which means that traditional optimization techniques, such as gradient-based methods cannot deal with such kinds of problems well. Recent trends tend to use bio-inspired optimization techniques as a promising alternative, and it is usually combined with traditional methods, especially in the area of image processing. These bio-inspired computational methods are usually based on swarm intelligence and can be very effective in coping with nonlinearity in real-world problems. This chapter presents an overview of bio-inspired computation and its application in image processing, including some current trends and important issues, such as efficiency and time constraints.

AB  - In the wild, thinking demonstrably uses interactive processes that draw on a wide range of external resources, spanning multiple time scales. As Malafouris (2015, p. 361) puts it, “cognition is not a within property; it is an in-between process”. Interactive processes configure extended systems within which each human agent is embedded. Yet much research on higher cognition, such as problem solving, reflects an implicit but deep commitment to methodological individualism that casts the agent as the ontological locus of cognition, and largely dictates the nature of the research enterprise. Thus, tasks to measure capacities and gauge reasoning performance are designed in a manner that reduces or eliminates the possibility of interacting with the problem presentation; if thinking takes place in the head, there is no need or reason to engineer procedures wherein agents can interact with the task's physical constituents. Conversely, a methodological interactivism forces one to acknowledge the participative yet not all-encompassing role of capacities such as working memory and thinking dispositions; it also encourages the granular mapping of the cognitive ecosystem from which new ideas emerge. To adopt an interactivist perspective is thus to focus on the cognitive resources of the extended system inviting a careful description of how these resources are dynamically configured over time and space to promote the development of new ideas in problem solving. In turn, a systemic perspective encourages the development of interventions that promote cognitive performance through the optimisation of systemic rather than individualist cognitive resources.

AB  - In this paper, we trace four origins of agent-based computational economics (ACE), namely, the markets origin, the cellular-automata origin, the tournaments origin, and the experiments origin. Along with this trace, we examine how these origins have motivated different concepts and designs of agents in ACE, which starts from the early work on simple programmed agents, randomly behaving agents, zero-intelligence agents, human-written programmed agents, autonomous agents, and empirically calibrated agents, and extends to the newly developing cognitive agents, psychological agents, and culturally sensitive agents. The review also shows that the intellectual ideas underlying these varieties of agents cross several disciplines, which may be considered as a part of a general attempt to study humans (and their behavior) with an integrated interdisciplinary foundation.

AB  - The history of perceptual control theory's growing influence in the field of Industrial-Organizational Psychology is described. This history began in the early 1980's and included mostly conceptual work that described how control theory concepts might be used to understand applied phenomena. Both conceptual and empirical work on control theory ideas continued throughout the 1990's despite a substantial backlash against the theory by prominent scholars in the field. However, it was conceptual and empirical work in the 21st century that defined its potential integrative value and its theoretical rigor. Moreover, research regarding self-efficacy demonstrated how informal theories of human behavior might be better understood from a control theory perspective. Much of the current work with perceptual control theory involves the construction and testing of computational models that represent the links among perceptual, learning, and thinking modes of self-regulation and control.

AB  - Purpose
Reliability and maintainability are the key system effectiveness measures in process and manufacturing industries, and treatment plants, especially in E-waste management plants. The present work is proposed with a motto to develop a stochastic framework for the e-waste management plant to optimize its availability integrated with reliability, availability, maintainability, and dependability (RAMD) measures and Markovian analysis to estimate the steady-state availability of the E-waste management plant. In the analysis an effort is also made to identify the best performing algorithm for availability optimization of the e-waste plant.
Methodology
A stochastic model for a particular plant is developed and its availability is optimized using various metaheuristic approaches like a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolutions (DE). The most sensitive component is identified using RAMD methodology while the effect of deviation in various failure and repair rates are observed by the proposed model. The failure and repair rates follow an exponential distribution. All time-dependent random variables are statistically independent.
Originality/Novelties
A novel stochastic model is presented for an e-waste management plant and optimum availability is obtained using metaheuristic approaches. The proposed methodology is not so far discussed in the reliability analysis of process industries.
Findings
The numerical results of the proposed model compared to identify the most efficient algorithm. It is observed that genetic algorithm provides the maximum value (0.92330969) of availability at a population size 2500 after 500 iterations. PSO algorithm attained the maximum value (0.99996744) of availability just after 50 iterations and 100 population size. So, its rate of convergence is faster than GA. The optimum value of availability is 0.99997 using differential evolution after 500 iterations and population size of more than 1000. These findings are very beneficial for system designers.
Practical Implications
The proposed methodology can be utilized to find the reliability measures of other process industries.

The cases we present here demonstrate four different types of cross-domain connections: (a) mathematically reproducing the work of a computer program, (b) cyclically improving a program to produce better output, (c) coupling math to output to justify program improvements and (d) coupling math to code to justify program design. We provide rich examples of the ways in which students make these connections and discuss affordances for mathematical learning in this context.

AB  - This paper explores the hydrological history of the Hunter River and Estuary (Newcastle, Australia), to identify pathways for incorporating climate-sensitive adaptation approaches into urban development and planning. The research method utilises mapping as a methodological discovery tools to visually articulate the correlation of pre-colonial hydrological landscapes, the transformation of the estuary over two centuries, the areas identified as at risk, and the opportunities for developing a climate-resilient estuary. This research aims to contribute to the redefinition of the discourse on the role of estuary planning for changing climate, focusing on four critical aspects: identify the impacts of urbanisation and industrialisation on ecosystems and its correlation with climate hazard at the estuary; visualise such transformations over time and space to identify critical spatial and climate factors threatening inhabitation; propose strategic spatial practices towards adaptation and resilience; and synthesising the options to foster reflective thinking and establish a correlation with novel policies, governance and practices. The study highlights that adopting new urbanism aligned with cultural and ecological principles can mitigate future climate impacts through re-naturalisation and urban adaptation to sea-level rise by focusing on proactive approaches to building resilient communities. This paper also acknowledges the need for site-specific adaptive design and planning strategies at multiple scales and governance levels.

AB  - This study highlights the potential benefits of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into chemical engineering education. In this study, Chat-GPT, a user-friendly LLM, is used as a problem-solving tool. Chemical engineering education has traditionally focused on fundamental knowledge in the classroom with limited opportunities for hands-on problem-solving. To address this issue, our study proposes an LLMs-assisted problem-solving procedure. This approach promotes critical thinking, enhances problem-solving abilities, and facilitates a deeper understanding of core subjects. Furthermore, incorporating programming into chemical engineering education prepares students with vital Industry 4.0 skills for contemporary industrial practices. During our experimental lecture, we introduced a simple example of building a model to calculate steam turbine cycle efficiency, and assigned projects to students for exploring the possible use of LLMs in solving various aspect of chemical engineering problems. Although it received mixed feedback from students, it was found to be an accessible and practical tool for improving problem-solving efficiency. Analyzing the student projects, we identified five common difficulties and misconceptions and provided helpful suggestions for overcoming them. Our course has limitations regarding using advanced tools and addressing complex problems. We further provide two additional examples to better demonstrate how to integrate LLMs into core courses. We emphasize the importance of universities, professors, and students actively embracing and utilizing LLMs as tools for chemical engineering education. Students must develop critical thinking skills and a thorough understanding of the principles behind LLMs, taking responsibility for their use and creations. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing chemical engineering education's learning experience and outcomes by integrating LLMs.

AB  - In everyday life the use of vehicles has expanded immensely for some ventures and house hold applications, likewise the running time of engine cycle is exceptionally long. Thus because of the consistent running enormous measure of heat is produced. At the point when this heat isn't appropriately disseminated, the engine gets more fragile very soon and life of the engine declines because of the heat development. To build the life of the engine, heat dispersal is expanded by giving fins at external of engine chamber. The shape of the fins and the material used for the fin increases its heat dissipation capacity and in turn increases the cooling of the engine for proper functioning. The present work focuses on the design of fins of circular and tapered shapes for a 2-stroke engine. The temperature distribution and the heat dissipation along the fin surface of two shapes has been observed by a steady state thermal analysis. Alusil and Silumin has been selected as the fin materials and a computational evaluation has also been done using FEM. A better shape of the fin along with a suitable material has been selected based on the results observed by FEM and on comparison with the existing shape and material of the fin.

AB  - Although the effects of attention on movement execution are well documented behaviorally, much less research has been done on the neurophysiological changes that underlie attentional focus effects. This study presents two experiments exploring effects of attention during an isometric plantar-flexion task using surface electromyography (sEMG). Participants' attention was directed either externally (towards the force plate they were pushing against) or internally (towards their own leg, specifically the agonist muscle). Experiment 1 tested the effects of attention on accuracy and efficiency of force produced at three target forces (30, 60, and 100% of the maximum voluntary contraction; MVC). An internal focus of attention reduced the accuracy of force being produced and increased cocontraction of the antagonist muscle. Error on a given trial was positively correlated with the magnitude of cocontraction on that trial. Experiment 2 tested the effects of attention on muscular fatigue at 30, 60 and 100%MVC. An internal focus of attention led to less efficient intermuscular coordination, especially early in the contraction. These results suggest that an internal focus of attention disrupts efficient motor control in force production resulting in increased cocontraction, which potentially explains other neuromechanical findings (e.g. reduced functional variability with an internal focus).

AB  - An agent-based model is a virtual world comprising distributed heterogeneous agents who interact over time. In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare. Examples include the spatial and temporal coordination of human activities, the diffusion of new ideas or of infectious diseases, and the emergence and ecological dynamics of innovative ideas or of deadly new diseases.

AB  - This paper reexamines neurophysiological results from echolocating big brown bats to propose a new perspective on FM biosonar processing in the auditory system. Individual auditory neurons are frequency-tuned and respond to brief, 2–10ms FM sweeps with an average of one spike per sound to register their tuned frequencies, to detect echo arrival, or to register a local null in the echo spectrum. When initiated by the broadcast, these responses comprise a cascade of single spikes distributed across time in neurons tuned to different frequencies that persists for 30–50ms, long after the sound has ended. Their progress mirrors the broadcast's propagation away from the bat and the return of echoes for distances out to 5–8m. Each returning echo evokes a similar pattern of single spikes that coincide with ongoing responses to the broadcast to register the target's distance and shape. The hypothesis advanced here is that this flow of responses over time acts as an internal model of sonar acoustics that the bat executes using neuronal computations distributed across many neurons to accumulate a dynamic image of the bat's surroundings.

AB  - We develop a formal model for distributed measurement-based quantum computations, adopting an agent-based view, such that computations are described locally where possible. Because the network quantum state is in general entangled, we need to model it as a global structure, reminiscent of global memory in classical agent systems. Local quantum computations are described as measurement patterns. Since measurement-based quantum computation is inherently distributed, this allows us to extend naturally several concepts of the measurement calculus [V. Danos, E. Kashefi and P. Panangaden, The measurement calculus (2004), arXiv:quant-ph/0412135], a formal model for such computations. Our goal is to define an assembly language, i.e. we assume that computations are well-defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques. The operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic transition system, and we define operational equivalence in a way that it corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity. With this in place, we prove that teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel, and this also within the context of larger networks.

KW  - Region computation
KW  - Diagram generation
AB  - Euler diagrams are an accessible and effective visualisation of data involving simple set-theoretic relationships. Sets are represented by closed curves in the plane and often have wellformedness conditions placed on them in order to enhance comprehensibility. The theoretical underpinning for tool support has usually focussed on the problem of generating an Euler diagram from an abstract model. However, the problem of efficient computation of the abstract model from the concrete diagram has not been addressed before, despite this computation being a necessity for computer interpretations of user drawn diagrams. This may be used, together with automated manipulations of the abstract model, for purposes such as semantic information presentation or diagrammatic theorem proving. Furthermore, in interactive settings, the user may update diagrams “on-line” by adding and removing curves, for example, in which case a system requirement is the update of the abstract model (without the necessity of recomputation of the entire abstract model). We define the notion of marked Euler diagrams, together with a method for associating marked points on the diagram with regions in the plane. Utilising these, we provide on-line algorithms which quickly compute the abstract model of a weakly reducible wellformed Euler diagram (constructible as a sequence of additions or removals of curves, keeping a wellformed diagram at each step), and quickly updates both the set of curves in the plane as well as the abstract model according to the on-line operations. Efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with a common, naive algorithm. Furthermore, the methodology enables a straightforward implementation which has subsequently been realised as an application for the user classification domain.

AB  - This paper discusses the problem of defining marginal costs when integer variables are present, in the context of short-term power auctions. Most of the proposals for price computation existing in the literature are concerned with short-term competitive equilibrium (generators should not be willing to change the dispatch assigned to them by the auctioneer), which implies operational-cost recovery for all of the generators accepted in the auction. However, this is in general not enough to choose between the different pricing schemes. We propose to include an additional criterion in order to discriminate among different pricing schemes: prices have to be also signals for generation expansion. Using this condition, we arrive to a single solution to the problem of defining prices, where they are computed as the shadow prices of the balance equations in a linear version of the unit commitment problem. Importantly, not every linearization of the unit commitment is valid; we develop the conditions for this linear model to provide adequate investment signals. Compared to other proposals in the literature, our results provide a strong motivation for the pricing scheme and a simple method for price computation.

AB  - This paper has proposed an integrated healthcare monitoring solution for the soldiers deployed in adverse environmental conditions, using the internet of things (IoT) with distributed computing. For these soldiers, the health parameters of every individual need to be monitored on a real-time basis and subsequent analysis of the dataset to be made for initiating appropriate medical support with the lowest possible delay. In this paper, a three-layer service-oriented IoT architecture has been proposed where the computational functionalities are distributed among all the layers. The proposed distributed computing mechanism has implemented two levels of filtration of redundant information that belongs to safe soldiers. The first level of filtering is done at the end-node using the Fuzzy classification approach and the second level of filtering is done at the intermediate node using the time-series pattern analysis approach. This layer-wise filtration process results in a reduction in data flooding and computational burden on the cloud due to which system response time improves to suit emergency applications. A prototype has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB  - Creativity, transforming imaginative thinking into reality, is a mental imagery simulation in essence. It can be incorporeal, concerns sophisticated and/or substantial thinking, and involves objects. In the present study, a mental imagery task consisting of creating a scene using familiar (FA) or abstract (AB) physical or virtual objects in real (RMI) and augmented reality (VMI) environments, and an execution task involving effectively creating a scene in augmented reality (VE), were utilised. The beta and gamma neural oscillations of healthy participants were recorded via a 32 channel wireless 10/20 international EGG system. In real and augmented environments and for both the mental imagery and execution tasks, the participants displayed a similar cortico-cortical neural signature essentially based on synchronous vs asynchronous beta and gamma oscillatory activities between anterior (i.e. frontal) and posterior (i.e. parietal, occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal) areas bilaterally. The findings revealed a transient synchronised neural architecture that appears to be consistent with the hypothesis according to which, creativity, because of its inherent complexity, cannot be confined to a single brain area but engages various interconnected networks.

There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS.

AB  - Biochemical and genetic regulatory networks are often modeled by Petri nets. We study the algebraic structure of the computations carried out by Petri nets from the viewpoint of algebraic automata theory. Petri nets comprise a formalized graphical modeling language, often used to describe computation occurring within biochemical and genetic regulatory networks, but the semantics may be interpreted in different ways in the realm of automata. Therefore, there are several different ways to turn a Petri net into a state-transition automaton. Here, we systematically investigate different conversion methods and describe cases where they may yield radically different algebraic structures. We focus on the existence of group components of the corresponding transformation semigroups, as these reflect symmetries of the computation occurring within the biological system under study. Results are illustrated by applications to the Petri net modelling of intermediary metabolism. Petri nets with inhibition are shown to be computationally rich, regardless of the particular interpretation method. Along these lines we provide a mathematical argument suggesting a reason for the apparent all-pervasiveness of inhibitory connections in living systems.

AB  - Interest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained increased popularity over the past decade. The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing computational simulation—from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the “black boxes” in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple “click of a button.” The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to “acquire” data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.

AB  - The needs of everyday life, such as counting and measuring, are roots of theoretical mathematics. I believe these roots are why mathematical ideas ground research so amazingly well within many scientific fields. Initially trained as a theoretical mathematician and having collaborated with non-mathematicians in the field of bone research, I address the advantages and challenges of collaborations across fields of research among investigators trained in different disciplines. I report on the mathematical ideas that have guided my research on the mechanics of bone tissue. I explain how the mathematical ideas of local vs. global properties influence my research. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) is a tool that I use consistently, in association with other microscopy techniques, to investigate bone in its healthy state and in the presence of bone disease, in humans and in animal models. I review the results that I and investigators around the world have obtained with PLM. Applied to thin bone sections, PLM yields extinct (black) and bright (white) signals that are interpreted in terms of the orientation of collagen type I, by means of other microscopy techniques. Collagen type I is an elementary component of bone tissue. Its orientation is important for the mechanical function of bone. Images obtained by PLM at a specific bone site yield big data sets regarding collagen orientation. Multiple data sets in respect of multiple sites are often needed for research because the bone tissue differs by location in response to the distinct forces acting on it. Mathematics, defined by philosophers as the theory of patterns, offers the backdrop for pattern identification in the big data sets regarding collagen orientation. I also discuss the computational aspect of the research, pursuant to which the patterns identified are incorporated in simulations of mechanical behaviors of bone. These mathematical ideas serve to understand the role of collagen orientation in bone fracture risk.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges facing the cognitive sciences is to explain what it means to know a language, and how the knowledge of language is acquired. The dominant approach to this challenge within linguistics has been to seek an efficient characterization of the wealth of documented structural properties of language in terms of a compact generative grammar—ideally, the minimal necessary set of innate, universal, exception-less, highly abstract rules that jointly generate all and only the observed phenomena and are common to all human languages. We review developmental, behavioral, and computational evidence that seems to favor an alternative view of language, according to which linguistic structures are generated by a large, open set of constructions of varying degrees of abstraction and complexity, which embody both form and meaning and are acquired through socially situated experience in a given language community, by probabilistic learning algorithms that resemble those at work in other cognitive modalities.

AB  - Tourism is a very important sector and has a major influence on development and national income. Moreover, Indonesia has thousands of tourist destinations that are very beautiful and interesting to visit, both for Indonesians and foreigners. It's just that, there are still many local tours, such as tourist villages, which are still not well known by most people. In fact, there are many cultures, customs, places of recreation, or characteristics of an area that need to be seen and introduced to outsiders, even to Indonesians themselves. Therefore, this study aims to explain the problems that occur in the field of tourism, as well as provide solutions in the form of tourism applications that aim to help promote local Indonesian tourism, as well as make it easy for travel enthusiasts to organize their travel plans. The process of making this travel application is also carried out through various research and interviews with potential users and IT people in order to produce an attractive and effective application. This study uses the design thinking method. Researchers collected data sources from literature studies and surveys through questionnaires, where the results of the data obtained from the questionnaires were numerical or quantitative. The aim is to determine the level of public interest in tourism, as well as determine the level of potential users of this tourism application. That way, the goals of this application will be achieved and effective in helping solve tourism problems.

CADD methods have made key contributions to the development of drugs that are in clinical use or in clinical trials. Such methods have emerged and evolved along with experimental approaches used in drug design. In this chapter we discuss the major CADD methods and examples of recent applications to drugs that have advanced in clinical trials or that have been approved for clinical use. We also comment on representative trends in current drug discovery that are shaping the development of novel methods, such as computer-aided drug repurposing. Similarly we present emerging concepts and technologies in molecular modeling and chemoinformatics. Furthermore, this chapter discusses the authors’ point of view of the challenges of traditional and novel CADD methods to increase their positive impact in drug discovery.

However, existing systems mainly served as a workflow system, a reporting system, or a database system for storing this kind of information. The massive amount of unstructured narrative data makes it extremely difficult to be shared and reused. Actual knowledge sharing and reuse among the workers is still limited. This paper presents a Computational Knowledge Elicitation and Sharing System which attempts to elicit knowledge from individuals as well as a team and converts it into a structured format and shared among the team. The proposed system accomplishes several current technologies in knowledge-based system, artificial intelligence and natural language processing, which converts the narrative knowledge of knowledge workers into a concept mapping representation. With a sufficient number of narratives, patterns are revealed and an aggregate concept map for all participating members is produced. It converts the unstructured text into a more structured format which helps to summarize and share the knowledge that can be taken in handling different case management issues. Such integration is considered to be novel. A prototype system has been implemented based on the method successfully in the mental healthcare of a social service organization for handling their case management issues. An experiment has been carried out for measuring the accuracy for converting the unstructured data into the structured format. The theoretical results are found to agree well with the experimental results.

AB  - This paper presents a computational theory of developmental mental architectures for artificial and natural systems, motivated by neuroscience. The work is an attempt to approximately model biological mental architectures using mathematical tools. Six types of architecture are presented, beginning with the observation-driven Markov decision process as Type-1. From Type-1 to Type-6, the architecture progressively becomes more complete toward the necessary functions of autonomous mental development. Properties of each type are presented. Experiments are discussed with emphasis on their architectures.

AB  - This article investigates the different ways that uncertainty is understood and approached across design disciplines. Structural attitudes toward uncertainty are assessed in design thinking literature before other possible ways of viewing uncertainty in the design process are introduced. Uncertainty is then presented as a source of epistemological difference between design disciplines, and this difference is explicated through a project that uses literature survey and analytical diagramming to map differences between discipline attitudes to uncertainty. Our review identifies uncertainty as a prevalent source of discipline difference with the goal of better describing barriers, and effective responses to them, in inter- and trans-disciplinary design agendas.

AB  - Energy conservation and emissions reduction in the construction industry are important steps in achieving China's goals of peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. The premise for building carbon emission (CE) reduction is to produce accurate CE calculations. Existing calculation methods for building CEs have many problems, such as complicated calculations, large data demands, time-consuming and laborious processes, weak design orientation of results, and poor feedback on emission reduction. At the same time, the calculation of CEs during the process of architectural design faces obstacles such as uncertainty of information, incomplete data, and difficulty in obtaining a bill of quantities based on design information. To resolve these obstacles, this study, based on a designer's vocabulary and thinking mode, describes the construction of a “design-oriented” calculation methods for building-embodied carbon emissions (ECEs). The prediction and assessment of the impact on the building environment during the architectural design process were helpful for identifying the key areas for carbon reduction, exploring potential emission reduction hotspots, and providing timely feedback for design optimization, which can have important theoretical value and practical significance in promoting the construction of low-carbon buildings.

AB  - Graphics processing unit (GPU) is an electronic circuit which manipulates and modifies the memory for better image output. Deep learning involves huge amounts of matrix multiplications and other operations which can be massively parallelized and thus sped up on GPUs. A single GPU might have thousands of cores while a CPU usually has no more than 12 cores. GPU's practical applicability is affected by two issues: long training time and limited GPU memory, which is greatly influenced as the neural network size grows. In order to overcome these issues, this chapter presents various technologies in distributed parallel processing which improve the training time and optimize the memory, and hardware engine architectures will be explored for data size reduction. The GPUs generally used for deep learning are limited in memory size compared to CPUs, so even the latest Tesla GPU has only 16 GB of memory. Therefore, GPU memory cannot be increased to that extent easily, so networks must be designed to fit within the available memory. This could be a factor limiting progress, overcoming which would be highly beneficiary to the computational intelligence area.

AB  - It is now rare to find biological, or genetic investigations that do not rely on the tools, data, and thinking drawn from the genomic sciences. Much of this revolution is powered by contemporary sequencing approaches that readily deliver large, genome-wide data sets that not only provide genetic insights but also uniquely report molecular outcomes from experiments that biophysicists are increasingly using for potentiating structural and mechanistic investigations. In this perspective, I describe a path of how biophysical thinking greatly contributed to this revolution in ways that parallel advancements in computer science through discussion of several key inventions, described as “foundational devices.” These discussions also point at the future of how biophysics and the genomic sciences may become more finely integrated for empowering new measurement paradigms for biological investigations.

AB  - The Fisher scoring and Gauss–Newton methods are two known methods for maximum likelihood computation. This paper provides a generalization for each method in a unified manner so that they can be used for some difficult maximum likelihood computation, when, for example, there exist constraints on the parameters. A generalized method does not use directly the Newton-type iteration formulas of these methods, but, instead, uses the corresponding quadratic functions transformed from them. It proceeds by repeatedly approximating the log-likelihood function with the quadratic functions in the neighborhoods of the current iterates and optimizing each quadratic function within the parameter space. It is shown that each quadratic function has a weighted linear regression formulation, which can be conveniently solved. This generalization also extends the applicability of the Fisher scoring method to situations when the expected Fisher information matrices are unavailable in closed form. Fast computation can generally be anticipated, owing to their small rates of convergence and a rapid solution of each linear regression problem. While the generalized Gauss–Newton method may sometimes suffer for the so-called large residual problem, the generalized Fisher scoring method has performed consistently well in the numerical experiments we conducted.

AB  - Despite the popularity of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, their tuning aspect continues to present challenges for researches and plant operators. Various control design methodologies have been proposed in the literature, such as auto-tuning, self-tuning, and pattern recognition. The main drawback of these methodologies in the industrial environment is the number of tuning parameters to be selected. In this paper, the design of a PID controller, based on the universal model of the plant, is derived, in which there is only one parameter to be tuned. This is an attractive feature from the viewpoint of plant operators. Fuzzy and neural approaches – bio-inspired methods in the field of computational intelligence – are used to design and assess the efficiency of the PID controller design based on differential evolution optimization in nonlinear plants. The numerical results presented herein indicate that the proposed bio-inspired design is effective for the nonlinear control of nonlinear plants.

This work reflects on the use of scenario- and problem-based learning as a way of conveying not only fundamental knowledge, but also to provide training in the use of computational Process Systems Engineering (PSE) tools applied to open-ended real world problems. The teaching framework also has a strong emphasis on the development of professional skills and to evaluate the recommended design solutions considering multiple perspectives such as economics, safety, environment and societal context. The framework is implemented through week-long group projects called Scenarios, taking place mainly in the first two years of study, and examples are given of different variations of Scenarios. This teaching approach has multiple benefits, including but not limited to, students’ understanding of PSE tools and the development of their critical engineering thinking.

ABSTRACT
Undergraduate genetics courses have historically focused on simple genetic models, rather than taking a more multifactorial approach where students explore how traits are influenced by a combination of genes, the environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. While a focus on simple genetic models can provide straightforward examples to promote student learning, they do not match the current scientific understanding and can result in deterministic thinking among students. In addition, undergraduates are often interested in complex human traits that are influenced by the environment, and national curriculum standards include learning objectives that focus on multifactorial concepts. This research aims to discover to what extent multifactorial genetics is currently being assessed in undergraduate genetics courses. To address this, we analyzed over 1,000 assessment questions from a commonly used undergraduate genetics textbook; published concept assessments; and open-source, peer-reviewed curriculum materials. Our findings show that current genetics assessment questions overwhelmingly emphasize the impact of genes on phenotypes and that the effect of the environment is rarely addressed. These results indicate a need for the inclusion of more multifactorial genetics concepts, and we suggest ways to introduce them into undergraduate courses.

AB  - This research explores the effect of the structuredness of design concept generation techniques on temporal network neurocognition. Engineering graduate students (n = 30) completed three concept generation tasks using techniques with different levels of structuredness: brainstorming, morphological analysis, and TRIZ. Students’ brain activation in their prefrontal cortex (PFC) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The temporal dynamic of central regions in brain networks were compared between tasks. Central regions facilitate functional interaction and imply information flow through the brain. A consistent central region appears in the medial PFC. Consistent network connections occurred across both hemispheres suggesting a concurrent dual processing of divergent and convergent thinking. This study offers novel insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanism when using these concept generation techniques.

AB  - This paper argues that there is a synchronicity among biological and computational levels on an organism and provides arguments and proofs based on experimental research gathered in the literature. The leading thread is the interplay between quantum biology (QB) and complexity. As the paper asks whether QB does contribute to complexity science (CS), five arguments are provided: (i) Firstly a state-of-the art of QB and its relationship to CS is sketched out. Thereafter, the attention is directed to answering the question set out; (ii) Secondly, it digs into the understanding of life toward deeper levels of reality; (iii) It is shown that non-trivial quantum effects shed insightful lights on the information processing of and within living beings; (iv) Once the distinction is made between increasing levels of complexity and increasing levels of organization, the focus lies in the importance of QB for organization, and not so much for complexity as such; (v) The role of information rises at the center of all concerns, and the intertwining of complexity and information processing. At the end some conclusions are drawn.

AB  - Abstract thinking is a cognitive process that involves the assimilation of concepts reduced from diffuse sensory input, organized, and interpreted in a manner beyond the obvious. There are multiple facets by which abstraction is measured that include semantic, visual-spatial and social comprehension. This study examined the prevalence and course of abstract and concrete responses to semantic proverbs and aberrant abstraction (composite score of semantic, visual-spatial, and social comprehension) over 20 years in 352 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and unipolar non-psychotic depression. We utilized linear models, two-way ANOVA and contrasts to compare groups and change over time. Linear models with Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) to determine association. Our findings show that regardless of diagnosis, semantic proverb interpretation improves over time. Participants with schizophrenia give more concrete responses to proverbs when compared to affective psychosis and unipolar depressed without psychosis. We also show that the underlying structure of concretism encompasses increased conceptual overinclusion at index hospitalization and idiosyncratic associations at follow-up; whereas, abstract thinking overtime encompasses increased visual-spatial abstraction at index and rich associations with increased social comprehension scores at follow-up. Regardless of diagnosis, premorbid functioning, descriptive characteristics, and IQ were not associated with aberrant abstraction. Delusions are highly and positively related to aberrant abstraction scores, while hallucinations are mildly and positively related to this score. Lastly, our data point to the importance of examining the underlying interconnected structures of ‘established’ constructs vis-à-vis mixed methods to provide a description of the rich interior world that may not always map onto current quantitative measures.

KW  - Reduced order model
KW  - Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
KW  - Incompressible nonisothermal flow
AB  - A new method is presented to generate reduced order models (ROMs) in Fluid Dynamics problems. The method is based on the expansion of the flow variables on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) basis, calculated from a limited number of snapshots, which are obtained via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Then, the POD-mode amplitudes are calculated as minimizers of a properly defined overall residual of the equations and boundary conditions. The residual can be calculated using only a limited number of points in the flow field, which can be scattered either all over the whole computational domain or over a smaller projection window. This means that the process is both computationally efficient (reconstructed flow fields require less than 1% of the time needed to compute a full CFD solution) and flexible (the projection window can avoid regions of large localized CFD errors). Also, various definitions of the residual are briefly discussed, along with the number and distribution of snapshots, the number of retained modes, and the effect of CFD errors, to conclude that the method is numerically robust. This is because the results are largely insensitive to the definition of the residual, to CFD errors, and to the CFD method itself, which may contain artificial stabilizing terms. Thus, the method is amenable for practical engineering applications.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a leading health burden worldwide. Previous research has demonstrated that linguistic analysis of depressed individuals’ written and oral speech has potential as a diagnostic and monitoring biomarker. We sought to determine if the semantic content of speech differs between individuals with current MDD, past MDD, and controls. We recruited 53 volunteers for a simulated telehealth psychiatric intake interview. The sample included 14 individuals with current MDD, 21 with past MDD, and 18controls, all confirmed using a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The manually-transcribed interview transcripts were analyzed utilizing the LIWC-22 dictionary and statistical tests were applied to identify differences in the linguistic patterns between each clinical categorization. When comparing depressed subjects (either current or past) versus controls, significant differences were found for emotional tone, total function words, auxiliary verbs, negative tone, negative emotion, anxiety, sadness, attention, and visual. Individuals with past MDD only differed from those with current MDD in use of analytical thinking and auxiliary verbs. These results indicate that LIWC categories could differentiate current or past depressed subjects from controls, but fewer differences emerged when comparing current and past MDD. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.

We prove that, for a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients bounded by 2ρ, the topology of the induced curve can be computed with Õ(n8ρ(n+ρ)) bit operations (Õ indicates that we omit logarithmic factors). Our analysis improves the previous best known complexity bounds by a factor of n2. The improvement is based on new techniques to compute and refine isolating intervals for the real roots of polynomials, and on the consequent amortized analysis of the critical fibers of the algebraic curve.

AB  - There has been an ongoing debate in research regarding the use of heuristics in decision-making. Advocators have succeeded in showing that applying heuristics not only reduces effort but can even be more accurate than analytical approaches under certain conditions. Others point out the biases and cognitive distortions inherent in disregarding information. Researchers have used both simulations and experiments to study how the use of heuristics affects the decision's outcome. However, a good decision is determined by the process and not a lucky outcome. It is a conscious reflection on the decision-maker's information and preferences. Therefore, a heuristic must be assessed by its ability to match a structured decision processing all available information. Thus, the question remains: how often does the reduction of information considered in heuristic decisions lead to a different recommended alternative? We applied different heuristics to a dataset of 945 real, personal decisions. We have found that by using heuristics instead of a fully developed decision structure, in 60.34% of cases, a different alternative would have been recommended to the decision-maker leading to a mean relative utility loss for the deviating decisions of 34.58%. This shows that a continuous effort to reflect on the weighing of objectives and alternatives leads to better decisions.

AB  - The relationship between nonword repetition ability and vocabulary size and vocabulary learning has been a topic of intense research interest and investigation over the last two decades, following the demonstration that nonword repetition accuracy is predictive of vocabulary size (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989). However, the nature of this relationship is not well understood. One prominent account posits that phonological short-term memory (PSTM) is a causal determinant both of nonword repetition ability and of phonological vocabulary learning, with the observed correlation between the two reflecting the effect of this underlying third variable (e.g., Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998). An alternative account proposes the opposite causality: that it is phonological vocabulary size that causally determines nonword repetition ability (e.g., Snowling, Chiat, & Hulme, 1991). We present a theory of phonological vocabulary learning, instantiated as a computational model. The model offers a precise account of the construct of PSTM, of performance in the nonword repetition task, of novel word form learning, and of the relationship between all of these. We show through simulation not only that PSTM causally affects both nonword repetition accuracy and phonological vocabulary size, but also that phonological vocabulary size causally affects nonword repetition ability. The plausibility of the model is supported by the fact that its nonword repetition accuracy displays effects of phonotactic probability and of nonword length, which have been taken as evidence for causal effects on nonword repetition accuracy of phonological vocabulary knowledge and PSTM, respectively. Thus the model makes explicit how the causal links posited by the two theoretical perspectives are both valid, in the process reconciling the two perspectives, and indicating that an opposition between them is unnecessary.

AB  - Belief elicitation is important in many different fields of economic research. We show that how a researcher elicits such beliefs – in particular, whether the belief is about the participant’s opponent, an unrelated other, or the population of others – strongly affects the belief reports. We study the underlying processes and find a clear consensus effect. Yet, when matching the opponent’s action would lead to a low payoff and the researcher asks for the belief about this opponent, ex-post rationalization kicks in and beliefs are re-adjusted again. Hence, we recommend to ask about unrelated others or about the population in such cases, as ‘opponent beliefs’ are even more detached from the beliefs participants had when deciding about their actions in the corresponding game. We find no evidence of wishful thinking in any of the treatments.

AB  - The study presents ten different exercises covering various computational tools. These exercises are practical applications presented to improve the understanding and skills of students in important concepts of chemical-aided process synthesis. A few exercises aim to build a foundation in computational techniques for chemical engineering undergraduates. The exercises are based on a spreadsheet that covers the design of regression analysis to find the optimum Antoine constants, array calculation for multicomponent distillation material balance, and the generation of a Gantt chart to plan and study the activities of batch processes. The other exercises included an introduction to process simulation, simulation, and reactor rating, and a simulation of multicomponent shortcut distillation. These exercises provide students with hands-on experience in utilizing process simulation software essential for analysing and optimizing chemical processes in real-world scenarios. The exercises also included the design of a heat exchanger network and solving a linear programming problem. An anonymous survey was collected from the cohort that had undergone the exercises, and the practical grades were compared with the batch that did not study the proposed exercises. Additionally, student feedback on practical exercises was collected. Based on the experience of the course coordinator and the collected feedback from participants, it was clear that the exercises helped students to inculcate critical thinking and self-learning abilities. An article essentially sheds light on the computer-aided practical exercises that enable chemical engineering graduates to engage in lifelong learning.

AB  - Quantum computing (QC) is a new area of research which incorporates elements from mathematics, physics, and computing. Quantum computing has generated a growing interest among scientists, technologists, and industrialists. Over the past decade it provided a platform for research to people in the scientific, technical, and industrial fields. Quantum physics concepts have been used in developing the basics of QC. In QC, the parallel processing feature has reduced the algorithm complexities which are being used. This feature helped find solutions to several optimization problems and issues that were related to it. Quantum inspired intelligent computational methods have been used in several application areas. Image segmentation is one such area and the exploration of this feature in image segmentation is the primary focus of this chapter.

AB  - We are rapidly moving into an era where AI and robots are part of everyday interactions in society and education, and there are immense discussions today about current and future technologies. Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents. The evidence shows emerging ways children relate to these. The potential of including children's actions and voices in the ongoing societal and educational debates on AI is discussed.

KW  - Conditional rewrite theories
AB  - Trace exploration is concerned with techniques that allow computation traces to be dynamically searched for specific contents. Depending on whether the exploration is carried backward or forward, trace exploration techniques allow provenance tracking or impact tracking to be done. The aim of provenance tracking is to show how (parts of) a program output depends on (parts of) its input and to help estimate which input data need to be modified to accomplish a change in the outcome. The aim of impact tracking is to identify the scope and potential consequences of changing the program input. Rewriting Logic (RWL) is a logic of change that supplements (an extension of) the equational logic by adding rewrite rules that are used to describe (nondeterministic) transitions between states. In this paper, we present a rich and highly dynamic, parameterized technique for the forward inspection of RWL computations that allows the nondeterministic execution of a given conditional rewrite theory to be followed up in different ways. With this technique, an analyst can browse, slice, filter, or search the traces as they come to life during the program execution. The navigation of the trace is driven by a user-defined, inspection criterion that specifies the required exploration mode. By selecting different inspection criteria, one can automatically derive a family of practical algorithms such as program steppers and more sophisticated dynamic trace slicers that compute summaries of the computation tree, thereby facilitating the dynamic detection of control and data dependencies across the tree. Our methodology, which is implemented in the Anima graphical tool, allows users to evaluate the effects of a given statement or instruction in isolation, track input change impact, and gain insight into program behavior (or misbehavior).

AB  - The resurgence of computer programming in the school curriculum brings a promise of preparing students for the future that goes beyond just learning how to code. This study reviewed research to analyse educational outcomes for children learning to code at school. A systematic review was applied to identify relevant articles and a thematic analysis to synthesise the findings. Ten articles were included in the synthesis and an overarching model was developed which depicts the themes. The results demonstrate that although students are learning to code, a range of other educational outcomes can be learnt or practiced through the teaching of coding. These included mathematical problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, self-management and academic skills. The review also identified the importance of instructional design for developing these educational outcomes through coding.

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared.

AB  - Objective:
Stimulation of axons within the dorsal columns of the human spinal cord has become a widely used therapy to treat refractory neuropathic pain. The mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated and may even be contrary to standard “gate control theory.” Our hypothesis is that a computational model provides a plausible description of the mechanism by which dorsal column stimulation (DCS) inhibits wide dynamic range (WDR) cell output in a neuropathic model but not in a nociceptive pain model.
Materials and Methods:
We created a computational model of the human spinal cord involving approximately 360,000 individual neurons and dendritic processing of some 60 million synapses—the most elaborate dynamic computational model of the human spinal cord to date. Neuropathic and nociceptive “pain” signals were created by activating topographically isolated regions of excitatory interneurons and high-threshold nociceptive fiber inputs, driving analogous regions of WDR neurons. Dorsal column fiber activity was then added at clinically relevant levels (e.g., Aβ firing rate between 0 and 110 Hz by using a 210-μsec pulse width, 50–150 Hz frequency, at 1–3 V amplitude).
Results:
Analysis of the nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and modulated circuits shows that, in contradiction to gate control theory, 1) nociceptive and neuropathic pain signaling must be distinct, and 2) DCS neuromodulation predominantly affects the neuropathic signal only, inhibiting centrally sensitized pathological neuron groups and ultimately the WDR pain transmission cells.
Conclusion:
We offer a different set of necessary premises than gate control theory to explain neuropathic pain inhibition and the relative lack of nociceptive pain inhibition by using retrograde DCS. Hypotheses regarding not only the pain relief mechanisms of DCS were made but also regarding the circuitry of pain itself, both nociceptive and neuropathic. These hypotheses and further use of the model may lead to novel stimulation paradigms.

AB  - The recognition-primed decision (RPD) model is a primary naturalistic decision-making approach which seeks to explicitly recognize how human decision makers handle complex tasks and environment based on their experience. Motivated by the need for quantitative computer modeling and simulation of human decision processes in various application domains, including medicine, we have developed a general-purpose computational fuzzy RPD model that utilizes fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules, and fuzzy reasoning to represent, interpret, and compute imprecise and subjective information in every aspect of the model. Experiences acquired by solicitation with experts are stored in experience knowledge bases. New local and global similarity measures have been developed to identify the experience that is most applicable to the current situation in a specific decision-making context. Furthermore, an action evaluation strategy has been developed to select the workable course of action. The proposed fuzzy RPD model has been preliminarily validated by using it to calculate the extent of causality between a drug (Cisapride, withdrawn by the FDA from the market in 2000) and some of its adverse effects for 100 hypothetical patients. The simulated patients were created based on the profiles of over 1000 actual patients treated with the drug at our medical center before its withdrawal. The model validity was demonstrated by comparing the decisions made by the proposed model and those by two independent internists. The levels of agreement were established by the weighted Kappa statistic and the results suggested good to excellent agreement.

AB  - Embodiment theory predicts that mental imagery of object words recruits neural circuits involved in object perception. The degree of visual imagery present in routine thought and how it is encoded in the brain is largely unknown. We test whether fMRI activity patterns elicited by participants reading objects' names include embodied visual-object representations, and whether we can decode the representations using novel computational image-based semantic models. We first apply the image models in conjunction with text-based semantic models to test predictions of visual-specificity of semantic representations in different brain regions. Representational similarity analysis confirms that fMRI structure within ventral-temporal and lateral-occipital regions correlates most strongly with the image models and conversely text models correlate better with posterior-parietal/lateral-temporal/inferior-frontal regions. We use an unsupervised decoding algorithm that exploits commonalities in representational similarity structure found within both image model and brain data sets to classify embodied visual representations with high accuracy (8/10) and then extend it to exploit model combinations to robustly decode different brain regions in parallel. By capturing latent visual-semantic structure our models provide a route into analyzing neural representations derived from past perceptual experience rather than stimulus-driven brain activity. Our results also verify the benefit of combining multimodal data to model human-like semantic representations.

AB  - Uncovering the root causes of complex diseases requires complex approaches, yet many studies continue to isolate the effects of genetic and social determinants of disease. Epidemiologic efforts that under-utilize genetic epidemiology methods and findings may lead to incomplete understanding of disease. Meanwhile, genetic epidemiology studies are often conducted without consideration of social and environmental context, limiting the public health impact of genomic discoveries. This divide endures despite shared goals and increases in interdisciplinary data due to a lack of shared theoretical frameworks and differing language. Here, we demonstrate that bridging epidemiological divides does not require entirely new ways of thinking. Existing social epidemiology frameworks including Ecosocial theory and Fundamental Cause Theory, can both be extended to incorporate principles from genetic epidemiology. We show that genetic epidemiology can strengthen, rather than detract from, efforts to understand the impact of social determinants of health. In addition to presenting theoretical synergies, we offer practical examples of how genetics can improve the public health impact of epidemiology studies across the field. Ultimately, we aim to provide a guiding framework for trainees and established epidemiologists to think about diseases and complex systems and foster more fruitful collaboration between genetic and traditional epidemiological disciplines.

AB  - The remarkable advances of high-performance computing to facilitate and increase efficiency in helping to resolve or support assessments on the toxic effects of chemicals on tissues and genomic material have led to development of novel in silico methods. These methods can support risk assessment via integration of study data that can be translated into meaningful predictive information. This chapter describes some methods in computational toxicology and how to integrate experimental data with computational assessments for supporting risk assessment.

AB  - Isolating blocks may be used as computational tools to search for the invariant manifolds of orbits and hyperbolic invariant sets associated with libration points while also giving additional insight into the dynamics of the flow in these regions. We use isolating blocks to investigate the dynamics of objects entering the Earth–Moon system in the circular restricted three-body problem with energies close to the energy of the L2 libration point. Specifically, the stable and unstable manifolds of Lyapunov orbits and the hyperbolic invariant set around the libration points are obtained by numerically computing the way orbits exit from an isolating block in combination with a bisection method. Invariant spheres of solutions in the spatial problem may then be located using the resulting manifolds.

AB  - Product concept generation and evaluation are two major activities for obtaining an optimal concept in conceptual design. In this paper, an integrated computational intelligence approach is proposed for dealing with these two aspects. A group of satisfactory concepts are generated first by using genetic algorithm and incorporating the information from knowledge base. Then concept evaluation and decision making are implemented using fuzzy neural network to obtain an optimal concept. Our procedure of using computational intelligence in conceptual design is described. The key issues in implementing the proposed approach are discussed, and finally the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated with an engineering example.

AB  - Intelligence and cognitive abilities often denoted good thinking. However, critics of intelligence tests have long pointed out that the failures of rational judgments and decision-making imperfectly correlate with intelligence. Reviewing the work of Keith Stanovich and his colleagues, paper highlights the role of individual differences in judgment and decision-making. Paper presents a case for typical performance measure of cognitive ability besides thinking dispositions to explain variations in rational thought. Specifically, we examine and model the relationship between need for cognition (a measure of thinking dispositions), absorptive capacity (typical performance measure of intelligence) and normative decision-making tasks.

AB  - Generative linguistics is often claimed by Chomsky to have a 'Galilean style', which is intended to position linguistics as a science continuous with standard practise in the natural sciences. These claims, however, are more suggestive than explanatory. The paper will, first, explain just what a Galilean style is. It will then be argued that its application to two key notions in generative linguistics - the competence/performance distinction (with reference to centre-embedding) and the notion of computation - demands a departure from what we might expect of a Galilean style. In this sense, the epithet is misleading. It will also be shown, however, that the 'Galilean' label is appropriate once we factor in the difference between a science concerned with kinematics (the relations between objects in space and time) and one concerned with language.

AB  - This project has developed a geometry learning software that integrates multiple computer technologies to address the challenges of deep analysis of knowledge points and establishing connections in learning software. The software combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet101) to encode text and image features. A self-attention mechanism is used to fuse information from both modalities, enabling decoding of geometric models and classification of corresponding knowledge points.This project uses LSTM and ResNet101 models to extract text and visual features for problem-solving using the Multi Mode Thinking Chain (CoT) method. Classification labels are utilized to generate text responses for problem-solving ideas. Furthermore, a recommendation module is proposed, which combines knowledge tracking and neural collaborative filtering algorithms to capture student behavior and knowledge point vectors. Implicit factors representing students' mastery of different knowledge points are used as inputs in neural collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations. The results demonstrate improvements in accuracy using the ResNet + LSTM multimodal algorithm, achieving a 13 % increase compared to single-modal classification. The multimodal CoT approach also outperforms language models like GPT3.5 and VisualBert by 10 %. Additionally, the combined algorithm of knowledge tracking and neural collaborative filtering shows a 13.3 % higher F1 value compared to ordinary algorithms, confirming the superiority of the adopted method in this project.

AB  - Optimization problems of modern day power system are very challenging to resolve because of its design complexity, wide geographical dispersion and influence from many unpredictable factors. For that reason, it is essential to apply most effective optimization techniques by taking full benefits of simplified formulation and execution of a particular problem. This study presents a summary of significant hybrid bio-inspired computational intelligence (CI) techniques utilized for power system optimization. Authors have reviewed an extensive range of hybrid CI techniques and examined the motivations behind their improvements. Various applications of hybrid bio-inspired CI algorithms have been highlighted in this paper. In addition, few drawbacks regarding the hybrid CI algorithms are explained. Current trends in CI techniques from the past researches have also been discussed in the domain of power system optimization. Lastly, some future research directions are suggested for further advancement of hybrid techniques.

AB  - In this paper, experimental, computational intelligence based and statistical investigations of warp tensions in different back-rest oscillations are presented. Firstly, in the experimental stage, springs having different stiffnesses are used to obtain different back-rest oscillations. For each spring, fabrics are woven in different weft densities and the warp tensions are measured and saved during weaving process. Secondly, in the statistical investigation, the experimental data are analyzed by using linear multiple and quadratic multiple-regression models. Later, in the computational intelligence based investigation, the data obtained from the experimental study are analyzed by using artificial neural networks that are universal approximators which provide a massively parallel processing and decentralized computing. Specially, radial basis function neural network structure is chosen. In this structure, cross-validation technique is used in order to determine the number of radial basis functions. Finally, the results of regression analysis, the computational intelligence based analysis and experimental measurements are compared by using the coefficient of determination. From the results, it is shown that the computational intelligence based analysis indicates a better agreement with the experimental measurement than the statistical analysis.

We analyze when these players follow max⁡min or max⁡max decision criteria, which we identify with pessimistic or optimistic attitudes, respectively. Explicitly formalizing these attitudes and how players reason interactively under ignorance, we characterize the behavioral implications related to common belief in these events: while optimism is related to Point Rationalizability, a new algorithm—Wald Rationalizability—captures pessimism. Our characterizations allow us to uncover novel results: (i) regarding optimism, we relate it to wishful thinking á la Yildiz (2007) and we prove that dropping the (implicit) “belief-implies-truth” assumption reverses an existence failure described therein; (ii) we shed light on the notion of rationality in ordinal games; (iii) we clarify the conceptual underpinnings behind a discontinuity in Rationalizability hinted in the analysis of Weinstein (2016).

AB  - To ensure optimal utilization and bioavailability, iron uptake, transport, subcellular localization, and assimilation are tightly regulated in plants. Herein, we examine recent advances in our understanding of cellular responses to Fe deficiency. We then use intracellular mechanisms of Fe homeostasis to discuss how formalizing cell biology knowledge via a mathematical model can advance discovery even when quantitative data is limited. Using simulation-based inference to identify plausible systems mechanisms that conform to known emergent phenotypes can yield novel, testable hypotheses to guide targeted experiments. However, this approach relies on the accurate encoding of domain-expert knowledge in exploratory mathematical models. We argue that this would be facilitated by fostering more “systems thinking” life scientists and that diversifying your research team may be a practical path to achieve that goal.

AI chatbots such as ChatGPT by OpenAI appear to be improving in conversational and other capabilities and this paper explores such advances using version 4. Based on a review of the research literature, a conceptual framework is formulated for responsible use of AI chatbots in education supporting cognitive flexibility in AI-rich learning environments. The framework is then operationalized for use in this paper through the development of exemplars for math, english language arts (ELA), and studying with ChatGPT to close learning gaps in an effort to foster more ethical and responsible approaches to the design and development of AI chatbots for application and use in teaching and learning environments. This paper extends earlier foundational work on cognitive flexibility and AI chatbots as well as work on cognitive flexibility in support of creativity and innovation with AI chatbots in urban civic spaces.

AB  - This paper revisits Myerson and Satterthwaite's (1983) classic analysis of mechanism design for bilateral trading, replacing equilibrium with a level-k model of strategic thinking and focusing on direct mechanisms. The revelation principle fails for level-k models, so restricting attention to direct mechanisms and imposing incentive-compatibility are not without loss of generality. If, however, only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible and traders' levels are observable, Myerson and Satterthwaite's characterization of mechanisms that maximize traders' total surplus subject to incentive constraints generalizes qualitatively to level-k models. If only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible but traders' levels are not observable, generically a particular posted-price mechanism maximizes traders' total expected surplus subject to incentive constraints. If direct, non-level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible and traders best respond to them, total expected surplus-maximizing mechanisms may take completely different forms.

Students successfully completed most of the tasks in 45minutes. Results from the Troubleshooting Assessment demonstrated that students developed sufficient fluency with programming to be able to apply their knowledge to new problems. These results suggest that troubleshooting scenarios can be used to assess student fluency in computer programming and computer-based problem solving.

The nuances in the pre-service teachers’ strategies were examined for the role of spatial visualization in the solution process. The findings suggest that inadequacies in visualizing the spatial configurations of the tasks led to incorrect numerical solutions despite the presence of conceptual knowledge. Furthermore, the tendency to rely on formula-based approaches appeared to have suppressed the preliminary spatial processing of the configurations. Theoretically, the paper offers insights into the mechanism that may be involved in the solution of spatially-related mathematical tasks. The findings imply that pre-service teachers need to be sufficiently engaged in spatial reasoning activities.

A total of 2124 students’ responses were analyzed to examine the impact of the prompts along multiple dimensions. In response to problem-posing prompts with more specific requirements, students tended to engage in more in-depth mathematical thinking and posed much more linguistically and semantically complex problems with more relationships or steps required to solve them. The findings from this study not only contribute to our understanding of problem-posing processes but also have direct implications for teaching mathematics through problem posing.

AB  - With the diversification of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the interest in their use in every segment and field of society in recent years has been increasing rapidly. One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.

AB  - Background
Depression is linked to cognitive biases towards more negative and less positive self-relevant information. Rumination, perseverative negative thinking about the past and the self, may contribute to these biases.
Methods
159 adolescents (12–18 years), with a range of depression symptoms, completed the SRET during fMRI. Multiple regressions tested associations between conventional self-report and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measured rumination, and neural and behavioral responses during a self-referent encoding task (SRET).
Results
Higher rumination (conventional self-report and EMA) was associated with more negative and fewer positive words endorsed and recalled. Higher self-reported (but not EMA) rumination was associated with higher accuracy in recognizing negative words and greater insula and dorsal anterior cingulate activity to negative versus positive words.
Limitations
The sample included mostly non-Hispanic White participants with household incomes above the national average, highlighting the need for replication in more diverse samples. Word endorsement discrepancies required fMRI analyses to model neural response to viewing negative versus positive words.
Conclusions
Adolescents with higher rumination endorsed and recalled more negative and fewer positive words and recognized more negative words during the SRET. Higher insula reactivity, a key region for modulating externally-oriented attention and internally-oriented self-referential processes, may contribute to links between rumination and negative memory biases. These findings provide insight into neurocognitive mechanisms underlying depression.

AB  - While much of the current study on quantum computation employs low-level formalisms such as quantum circuits, several high-level languages/calculi have been recently proposed aiming at structured quantum programming. The current work contributes to the semantical study of such languages by providing interaction-based semantics of a functional quantum programming language; the latter is, much like Selinger and Valiron's, based on linear lambda calculus and equipped with features like the ! modality and recursion. The proposed denotational model is the first one that supports the full features of a quantum functional programming language; we prove adequacy of our semantics. The construction of our model is by a series of existing techniques taken from the semantics of classical computation as well as from process theory. The most notable among them is Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI), categorically formulated by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott. The mathematical genericity of these techniques—largely due to their categorical formulation—is exploited for our move from classical to quantum.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive review of all significant research applying computational optimisation to sustainable building design problems. A summary of common heuristic optimisation algorithms is given, covering direct search, evolutionary methods and other bio-inspired algorithms. The main summary table covers 74 works that focus on the application of these methods to different fields of sustainable building design. Key fields are reviewed in detail: envelope design, including constructions and form; configuration and control of building systems; renewable energy generation; and holistic optimisations of several areas simultaneously, with particular focus on residential and retrofit. Improvements to the way optimisation is applied are also covered, including platforms and frameworks, algorithmic comparisons and developments, use of meta-models and incorporation of uncertainty. Trends, including the rise of multi-objective optimisation, are analysed graphically. Likely future developments are discussed.

AB  - This study delves into the intricate psycholinguistic mechanisms that underpin image formation within the educational network discourse, with a specific focus on the dynamics of suggestion and manipulation. In an era where digital communication reigns supreme, understanding how language shapes perceptions and influences behavior is paramount. This research seeks to unravel the complex interplay between suggestion, manipulation, and the formation of images within educational networks. Drawing from insights across disciplines such as psychology, linguistics, and communication studies, this study examines how linguistic cues and contextual factors interact to shape individuals' perceptions and responses within educational settings. Acknowledging the transformative power of language in shaping attitudes, beliefs, and actions, this study aims to shed light on the subtle yet profound ways in which educators employ linguistic strategies to influence discourse within educational networks. By employing a multifaceted approach that integrates theoretical frameworks with empirical analysis, this research endeavors to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving suggestion and manipulation within educational discourse. Through a meticulous examination of textual elements, discourse patterns, and communicative strategies employed by educators in digital environments, this study seeks to elucidate the intricate processes involved in image formation. By exploring the role of suggestion and manipulation in shaping perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the psycholinguistic underpinnings of educational network discourse. Furthermore, this study not only offers theoretical insights but also practical implications for educators, policymakers, and practitioners involved in educational communication. By highlighting the ethical considerations and implications of linguistic manipulation within educational networks, this research aims to empower stakeholders to navigate digital discourse with greater awareness and discernment. In conclusion, this study represents a significant contribution to the field of thinking skills and creativity by offering new insights into the psycholinguistic dynamics of image formation within educational networks. By unraveling the complexities of suggestion and manipulation, this research opens avenues for further inquiry and underscores the importance of critical thinking and creativity in navigating contemporary digital landscapes.

AB  - Using models to represent relationships between flow and fishes has important practical applications for managing reservoir releases. Attempts to model such relationships often neglect indirect mechanisms by which flow influences fish. For example, growth of salmon juveniles is measurably faster when flows inundate floodplain and promote higher production of invertebrate prey, but out-of-channel flows have not yet been incorporated into models. The QUANTUS model developed here represents indirect linkages between flow and freshwater survival, mediated by temperature and prey availability, for fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Quantiles of spawning time and place were used to define cohorts of salmon in a regulated Central Valley, California river. Survival of these quantile-cohorts was simulated through incubation, juvenile growth, and eventual downstream migration. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the seasonal timing of pulse flows. Simulated survival was highest for flow regimes that provided a modest, temperature-moderating pulse flow in early summer and, for wetter years, a second, larger pulse of over-bank flow in late winter. For many rivers of the Pacific coast that support fall Chinook salmon, the thermal window of opportunity for spawning and rearing is narrow. Optimized flows made the most of this window by providing access to accelerated juvenile growth and early survival in floodplain habitat, a result that should be verified with field experiments. Timing of optimized pulse flows differed in some respects from the region's natural hydrograph, dominated by spring runoff. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which flow influences fishes can be important when shaping flows in the changed context of a regulated river.

AB  - The capacity for thought and the ability to assemble and manipulate concepts are cognitive features unique to humans. Spontaneous thoughts often occur when we are engaged in attention-demanding tasks, with an increased frequency predicting negative affect. Meditation does not require thinking; however, thinking occurs naturally during meditation. We develop the hypothesis that chronic thinking associated with strong emotional arousal during meditation practice might be detrimental to meditation practice and well-being. One goal of meditation is to identify the arousal of emotions and thoughts, and remain equanimous with them. Over time, meditation may help dampen the attention-grabbing power of these thoughts both during practice and in daily life, which may consequently help deepen meditation practice. However, when meditators fail to remain equanimous, the effects of these thoughts may be deleterious. We discuss how this hypothesis may help guide future research on meditation.

AB  - The dorsal pallidal complex is made up of the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe and GPi respectively). It is part of the main axis of the basal ganglia (BG) that connects the thalamo-cortical networks to the BG input stages (striatum and subthalamic nucleus) and continues directly, and indirectly through the GPe, to the BG output stages (GPi and substantia nigra reticulata). Here we review the unique anatomical and physiological features of the pallidal complex and argue that they support the main computational goal of the BG main axis (actor); namely, a behavioral policy that maximizes future cumulative gains and minimizes costs. The three mono-layer competitive networks of the BG main axis flexibly extract relevant features from the current state of the thalamo-cortical activity to control current (ongoing) and future actions. We hypothesize that the striatal and the subthalamic projections neurons act as mono-stable integrators (class I excitability) and the in-vivo pallidal neurons act as bi-stable resonators (class II excitability). GPe neurons exhibit pausing behavior because their membrane potential lingers in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium point and bi-stability, and these pauses enable a less-greedy exploratory behavioral policy. Finally, degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine depletion (as in Parkinson's disease) lead to augmentation of striatal excitability and competitive dynamics. As a consequence the pallidal network, whose elements tend to synchronize as a result of their bi-stable resonance behavior, shifts from a Poissonian-like non-correlated to synchronous oscillatory discharge mode. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Function and Dysfunction of the Basal Ganglia.

AB  - Quantitative demonstrating of organic frameworks has turned into an essential computational methodology in the configuration of novel and investigation of existing natural frameworks. Be that as it may, active information that portrays the framework's elements should be known keeping in mind the end goal to get pertinent results with the routine displaying strategies. This information is frequently robust or even difficult to get. Here, we exhibit a model of quantitative fuzzy rational demonstrating approach that can adapt to obscure motor information and hence deliver applicable results despite the fact that dynamic information is fragmented or just dubiously characterized. Besides, the methodology can be utilized as a part of the blend with the current cutting edge quantitative demonstrating strategies just in specific parts of the framework, i.e., where the data are absent. The contextual analysis of the methodology suggested in this paper is performed on the model of nine-quality genes. We propose a kind of FPN model in light of fuzzy sets to manage the quantitative modeling of biological systems. The tests of our model appear that the model is practical and entirely powerful for information impersonation and thinking of fuzzy expert frameworks.

AB  - Experimental cell biology, biochemistry, and structural biology have provided a wealth of information about microtubule function and mechanism, but we are reaching a limit as to what can be understood from experiment alone. Standard biochemical approaches are not sufficient to make quantitative predictions about microtubule behavior, and they are limited in their ability to test existing conceptual models of microtubule mechanism. Because microtubules are so complex, achieving a deep understanding of microtubule behavior and mechanism will require the input of mathematical and computational modeling. However, this type of analysis can be daunting to the uninitiated. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a straightforward introduction to the various types of modeling and how they can be used to study microtubule function, dynamics, and mechanism.

AB  - The business resilience system (BRS) with its risk atom and processing data point is based on fuzzy logic and cloud computation in real time. Its purpose and objectives define a clear set of expectations for organizations and enterprises, so their network system and supply chain are totally resilient and protected against cyberattacks, man-made threats, and natural disasters. These enterprises include financial, organizational, homeland security, and supply chain operations with multipoint manufacturing across the world. Market share and marketing advantages are expected to result from the implementation of the system. The collected information and defined objectives provide the basis to monitor and analyze the data through cloud computation and will guarantee the success of their survivability against any unexpected threats. Putting this kind of operation in place allows the executive and stakeholders within those organizations and enterprises to make the right decision when encountering threats that interrupt their normal day-to-day operations, as well as, in cases such as defense and homeland security, to predict the next move of an adversary. Given the fact that the BRS, as part of its functionality, processes the incoming data and information if not real time, then near real time with the help of superartificial intelligence in place, this gives the stakeholder an edge against and threats as well as predicting issues with operational intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of those technologies that seem to be expanding in every direction. This technology will take center stage at Think 2018. Resilience thinking is inevitably systems thinking, at least as much as sustainable development is. In fact, “when considering systems of humans and nature (social-ecological systems), it is important to consider the system as a whole.” The term “resilience” originated in the 1970s in the field of ecology from the research of C.S. Holling, who defined resilience as “a measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables.” In short, resilience is best defined as “the ability of a system to absorb disturbances and still retain its basic function and structure.” In this chapter, we explain the BRS and how it works. Please note that the with minor editing and manipulation, the materials presented in this chapter have been borrowed from the book published from Zohuri and Moghaddam10 with permission from both authors and publisher as well.

AB  - There are numerous types of molecular orbital calculations that are routinely performed. One of the early versions is the extended Hückel method that begins with the approach used in the Hückel method, but with the overlap and exchange integrals (approximated by the Wolfsberg-Helmholtz, Ballhausen-Gray, or Cusachs' method) included. A more robust type of calculation is that in which an electron is presumed to move in a field generated by the nucleus and other electrons. A trial wave function with some adjustable parameter(s) is taken, and the energy calculated. The wave function improves and the calculations continue until there is no additional improvement (i.e., a “self-consistent field” has been obtained). There are numerous variations of this approach that differ in the trial wave function chosen, extent of electron-electron interaction included, etc. Density functional theory is a newer approach that uses less computational capacity. These types of molecular orbital calculations are surveyed briefly in this chapter.

AB  - Attribute reduction serves as a pivotal topic of rough set theory for data analysis. The ideas of tri-level thinking from three-way decision can shed new light on three-level attribute reduction. Existing classification-specific and class-specific attribute reducts consider only macro-top and meso-middle levels. This paper introduces a micro-bottom level of object-specific reducts. The existing two types of reducts apply to the global classification with all objects and a local class with partial objects, respectively. The new type applies to an individual object. These three types of reducts constitute tri-level attribute reducts. Their development and hierarchy are worthy of systematical explorations. Firstly, object-specific reducts are defined by object consistency from dependency, and they improve both classification-specific and class-specific reducts. Secondly, tri-level reducts are unified by tri-level consistency. Hierarchical relationships between object-specific reducts and class-specific, classification-specific reducts are analyzed, and relevant connections of three-way classifications of attributes are given. Finally, tri-level reducts are systematically analyzed, and two approaches, i.e., the direct calculation and hierarchical transition, are suggested for constructing a specific reduct. We build a framework of tri-level thinking and analysis of attribute reduction to enrich three-way granular computing. Tri-level reducts lead to the sequential development and hierarchical deepening of attribute reduction, and their results profit intelligence processing and system reasoning.

Objective. To explore pharmacy students’ perceptions of a novel web application tool (AcaWriter) implemented in a Master of Pharmacy curriculum to support reflective thinking in scientific research. Methods. A qualitative research design involving a 50-minute focus group (n=12) was used. The focus group session was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using the Braun and Clarke framework. Results. Analysis generated four themes related to AcaWriter’s utility in enhancing students’ research thinking and capacity. The themes identified included: ease of use to prompt reflection, tangible tool with non-judgmental capacity; benefits for enhancing self and peer reflection on research techniques and group dynamics; benefits of the reflective writing process to enhance research capacity compared with engaging in reflective dialogue; and benefits beyond the writing process: cultivating self-improvement and self-confidence. Conclusion. The findings of this study show that a novel web application implemented within a pharmacy curriculum can assist students’ self and peer reflection on a research task. Further research is needed to explore the impact of using this tool and its relationship with academic performance and outcomes.

AB  - The meteoric rise of cancer immunotherapy in the past decade has led to promising treatments for a number of hard-to-treat malignancies. In particular, adoptive T cell therapy has recently reached a major milestone with two products approved by the US FDA. However, the inherent complexity of cell-based immunotherapies means that their manufacturing time, cost, and controllability limit their effectiveness and geographic reach. One way to address these issues may lie in complementing the dominant, reductionistic mentality in modern medicine with complex systems thinking. In this opinion article, we identify key concepts from complexity theory to address manufacturing challenges in cell-based immunotherapies and raise the possibility of a unifying framework upon which future bioprocessing strategies may be designed.

AB  - The lackluster societal response to the climate crisis is partially attributed to the abstractness of people's mental construals of climate change given its vast spatial and temporal dimensions, which fail to evoke urgency to act. Prior efforts to measure mental construal levels of climate change are inconsistent, insufficient, and labor-intensive. This study developed and implemented learning experiences for integrating engineering design and climate fiction writing to engage 48 high school students in concrete climate change thinking. A novel measure of cognitive abstractness overcomes previous methodological shortcomings by automatically quantifying the linguistic abstractness of participant-authored stories using natural language processing. Comparing participant stories written at the beginning and end of the intervention reveals a significant decrease in linguistic abstractness (Cohen's d = 1.01, p = 0.03). This study contributes to the nascent movement for greater use of narratives as data sources in environmental psychology research, which may uncover new insights into human behavior and decision making.

AB  - The method of caustics is a powerful experimental method in elasticity and particularly in fracture mechanics for crack problems. The related method of pseudocaustics is also of interest. Here we apply the computational method of quantifier elimination implemented in the computer algebra system Mathematica in order to determine (i) the non-parametric equation and two properties of the caustic at a crack tip and especially (ii) the illuminated and the dark regions related to caustics and pseudocaustics in plane elasticity and plate problems. The present computations concern: (i) The derivation of the non-parametric equation of the classical caustic about a crack tip through the elimination of the parameter involved (here the polar angle) as well as two geometrical properties of this caustic. (ii) The derivation of the inequalities defining the illuminated region on the screen in the problem of an elastic half-plane loaded normally by a concentrated load with the boundary of this illuminated region related to some extent to the caustic formed. (iii) Similarly for the problem of a clamped circular plate under a uniform loading with respect to the caustic and the pseudocaustic formed. (iv) Analogously for the problem of an equilateral triangular plate loaded by uniformly distributed moments along its whole boundary, which defines the related pseudocaustic. (v) The determination of quantities of interest in mechanics from the obtained caustics or pseudocaustics. The kind of computations in the applications (ii) to (iv), i.e. the derivation of inequalities defining the illuminated region on the screen, seems to be completely new independently of the use here of the method of quantifier elimination. Additional applications are also possible, but some of them require the expansion of the present somewhat limited power of the quantifier elimination algorithms in Mathematica. This is expected to take place in the future.

AB  - There is an intense debate whether risk-taking behavior is partially driven by cognitive abilities. The critical issue is whether choices arising from subjects with lower cognitive abilities are more likely driven by errors or lack of understanding than pure preferences for risk. The latter implies that the often-argued link between risk preferences and cognitive abilities (a common finding is that abilities relate negatively to risk aversion and positively to loss aversion) might be a spurious correlation. This experiment reports evidence from a sample of 556 participants who made choices in two risk-related tasks and completed three cognitive tasks, all with real monetary incentives: number-additions (including incentive-compatible expected number of correct additions), the Cognitive Reflection Test (to measure analytical/reflective thinking) and the Remote Associates Test (for convergent thinking). Results are unambiguous: none of our cognition measures plays any systematic role on risky decision making. Using structural equation modeling and factor analysis, we show that cognitive abilities are negatively associated with noisy, inconsistent choices and this effect may make higher ability individuals appear to be less risk averse and more loss averse. Yet we show that errors are more likely to appear when the two payoffs in a given decision exhibit similar probability. Therefore, our results suggest that failing to account for noisy decision making might have led to erroneously inferring a correlation between cognitive abilities and risk preferences in previous studies.

AB  - Darwin concludes The Origin of Species with a splendid one-phrase poem,From so simple a beginningendless forms most beautiful and most wonderfulhave been, and are being, evolved. Darwin's “simple beginning” may be identified, in today's terminology, with dissipation—evolution's basic fuel. All the rest is commentary—or, more precisely, corollary. One can aptly apply Darwin's phrase to another kind of “simple beginning,” from which as well “endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” What I have in mind is a concept that is apparently the very antithesis of dissipation, namely, physics' fundamental assumption of invertibility—or “microscopic reversibility.” To paraphrase Dobzhansky, no sensible step can be taken today in information, communication, and computer sciences, as well as in fundamental physics, except in the light of invertibility.
