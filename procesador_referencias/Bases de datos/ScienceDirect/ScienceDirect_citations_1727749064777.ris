AB  - No biological system or structure is likely to be perfectly symmetrical, or have identical right and left forms. This review explores the evidence for eye and visual pathway asymmetry, in health and in disease, and attempts to provide guidance for those studying the structure and function of the visual system, where recognition of symmetry or asymmetry may be essential. The principal question with regards to asymmetry is not ‘are the eyes the same?’, for some degree of asymmetry is pervasive, but ‘when are they importantly different?’. Knowing if right and left eyes are ‘importantly different’ could have significant consequences for deciding whether right or left eyes are included in an analysis or for examining the association between a phenotype and ocular parameter. The presence of significant asymmetry would also have important implications for the design of normative databases of retinal and optic nerve metrics. In this review, we highlight not only the universal presence of asymmetry, but provide evidence that some elements of the visual system are inherently more asymmetric than others, pointing to the need for improved normative data to explain sources of asymmetry and their impact on determining associations with genetic, environmental or health-related factors and ultimately in clinical practice.

AB  - This introductory course in computational modeling of nature contains the development of three kinds of models of phenomena in nature -- agent-based models and simple finite difference models using the environment of the NetLogo language and complex finite difference models using the language of C++. No prior programming experience is assumed. The natural phenomena modeled include some standard ones (e.g. ants following pheromone trails, the interaction of sheep and wolves) and some non-standard ones (the creation of the world, 3 dogs playing games, and formation of stripes and spots in the skins of animals). The emphasis of the course is on the modeling process. A distinguishing feature is that students are able to compare and critique these models.

AB  - Simulation games are now increasingly applied to many subject domains as they allow students to engage in discovery processes, and may facilitate a flow learning experience. However, the relationship between learning experiences and problem solving strategies in simulation games still remains unclear in the literature. This study, thus, analyzed the feedback and problem solving behaviors of 117 students in a simulation game, designed to assist them to learn computational problem solving. It was found that students when learning computational problem solving with the game were more likely to perceive a flow learning experience than in traditional lectures. The students’ intrinsic motivation was also enhanced when they learned with the simulation game. In particular, the results of the study found a close association between the students’ learning experience states and their problem solving strategies. The students who perceived a flow experience state frequently applied trial-and-error, learning-by-example, and analytical reasoning strategies to learn the computational problem solving skills. However, a certain portion of students who experienced states of boredom and anxiety did not demonstrate in-depth problem solving strategies. For instance, the students who felt anxious in the simulation game did not apply the learning-by-example strategy as frequently as those in the flow state. In addition, the students who felt bored in the simulation game only learned to solve the problem at a superficial level.

AB  - This instructional case integrates multiple accounting concepts relating to fixed asset acquisition and subsequent measurement. You must apply accounting knowledge, professional judgment, and critical thinking skills to evaluate fixed assets and make recommendations. You must also analyze differences between fixed asset accounting under US generally accepted accounting principles and IFRS. As a student, you generally understand basic application of asset cost computation that simply recognizes the amount of cash paid for acquiring the asset. However, determining asset cost becomes challenging when you encounter more complex situations. You must consider initial measurement issues relating to a land purchase (demolition of existing building and a special assessment expenditure), interest capitalization for a self-constructed building, a nonmonetary asset exchange, and an asset retirement obligation. The case also considers subsequent measurement issues in terms of depreciation (straight-line and accelerated methods), replacement of an asset component, and impairment. The case structure is flexible and the teaching notes include alternatives for using scaled-down versions.

AB  - Integers have historically been approached as a system of rules. However, to teach any mathematical domain for understanding, teachers must conceptualize it as comprised of more than procedures. Using as a lens the four types of integer reasoning identified by Bishop et al. (2014a, 2014b), we interviewed 7th-grade teachers to investigate their own integer reasoning and how this corresponds to their approaches to teaching integers and to their interpretations of students’ reasoning. The teachers not only correctly solved integer tasks but also most reasoned using more than rules, demonstrating a flexibility of strategies. Additionally, although they attempted to introduce integers in meaningful ways, most teachers viewed teaching integers as helping their students apply procedures, an orientation that constrained their understanding of students’ integer reasoning. Results indicate that teachers possess productive conceptual resources but need a structure to leverage their understandings to teach integers as more than a set of rules.

As an advanced analytical technique, deep learning models significantly impact precision medicine because they can process voluminous amounts of diversified data with improved accuracy. Two salient features of deep learning models, namely processing a massive volume of multi-model data at multiple levels of abstraction and the ability to identify inherent features from the input data on their own, attract the implication of deep learning techniques in precision medicine research. The proposed review highlights the importance of deep learning-based analytical models in handling diversified and disparate big data sources of precision medicine. To augment further, state-of-the-art precision medicine research based on the taxonomy of deep learning models has been reviewed along with their research outcomes. The diversified data inputs used in research attempts, their applications, benchmarking data repositories, and usage of various evaluation measures for accuracy estimations are highlighted in this review. This review also brings out some promising analytical avenues of precision medicine research that give directions for future exploration.

The reasons for the incorrect earlier assignment are analyzed by calculations of conversion energy barriers among different intermediates, starting materials and final products. This study demonstrates that conflicting theoretical and, experimental results suggest that it is premature to assign the configuration of a natural product.

This leads to the need for creation of instructional tools and tasks that can offer students opportunities for active learning. This study examines the effect of a computational experiment as an instructional tool-for Grade 12 students, using a computer simulation environment created in Java for the domain of “linear oscillations without damping”. In this study we use the computational experiment as an integration of the computational science with the discovery learning method. The computational experiment supports both types of research, the exploratory as well as the inventive research, helping the learners to develop not only exploratory but also expressive models. The aim of the paper is threefold. At first we want to examine the influence of the computational experiment on students’ learning performance. The other two aims are related to the investigation of the experiment’s influence on students’ approach to learning and their beliefs on physics. Our results indicate that there is a strong shift on students’ conceptual understanding and to the consideration of the coherence of physics, as well as to the realization that physics is strongly connected to mathematics. Finally students realized that mathematics, physics and information theory are strongly connected cognitive disciplines.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the fastest growing developmental disability diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) and family physicians are typically the first point of contact for patients or family members concerned with ASD traits observed in themselves or their family member. Unfortunately, some families and adult patients are unaware of ASD traits that may be exhibited and as a result do not seek out necessary diagnostic services or contact their GP. Therefore, providing a quick, accessible, and simple tool utilizing items related to ASD to these families may increase the likelihood they will seek professional assessment and is vital to the early detection and treatment of ASD. This study aims at identifying fewer, albeit influential, features in common ASD screening methods in order to achieve efficient screening as demands on evaluating the items’ influences on ASD within existing tools is urgent. To achieve this aim, a computational intelligence method called Variable Analysis (Va) is proposed that considers feature-to-class correlations and reduces feature-to-feature correlations. The results of the Va have been verified using two machine learning algorithms by deriving automated classification systems with respect to specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and predictive accuracy. Experimental results using cases and controls related to items in three common screening methods, along with features related to individuals, have been analysed and compared with results obtained from other common filtering methods. The results exhibited that Va was able to derive fewer numbers of features from adult, adolescent, and child screening methods yet maintained competitive predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates.

AB  - The arising-from-chair task assessment is a key aspect of the evaluation of movement disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, common scale-based clinical assessment methods are highly subjective and dependent on the neurologist's expertise. Alternate automated methods for arising-from-chair assessment can be established based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images with multiple-instance learning. However, performance stability for such methods can be typically undermined by the presence of irrelevant or spuriously-relevant features that mask the intrinsic causal features. Therefore, we propose a QSM-based arising-from-chair assessment method using a causal graph-neural-network framework, where counterfactual and debiasing strategies are developed and integrated into this framework for capturing causal features. Specifically, the counterfactual strategy is proposed to suppress irrelevant features caused by background noise, by producing incorrect predictions when dropping causal parts. The debiasing strategy is proposed to suppress spuriously relevant features caused by the sampling bias and it comprises a resampling guidance scheme for selecting stable instances and a causal invariance constraint for improving stability under various interferences. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in detecting arising-from-chair abnormalities. Its clinical feasibility was further confirmed by the coincidence between the selected causal features and those reported in earlier medical studies. Additionally, the proposed method was extensible for another motion task of leg agility. Overall, this study provides a potential tool for automated arising-from-chair assessment in PD patients, and also introduces causal counterfactual thinking in medical image analysis.

AB  - Our main models of computation (the Turing Machine and the RAM) and most modern computer architectures make fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable on a physical computing device. The consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. Our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. We first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. We emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. We then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. The first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. We then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the Curry–Howard correspondence between logic and type theory. We develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. We then “move up a level” to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. To derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the “higher dimensional” analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. We conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research.

AB  - Enhancing REU (research experience for undergraduates) has become a popular strategy for many selective universities to enhance quality of undergraduate education and recruit gifted new students. The university that the authors are affiliated has set REU as one of the major outcomes for our QEP (quality enhancement program) for next 5 years. This paper presents a model centered REU program entitled as ACE standing for Analysis, Computation and Experiment. As a work in progress, the program is planned to run for the next 5 years and to serve for 20-30 undergraduate students who are gifted in mathematics and computing annually. ACE is to use interdisciplinary research projects, the guided exploration based on sound pedagogical practice and the top niche analogical and virtual dual lab facility bring measurable impacts to over a hundred of gifted undergraduates.

AB  - Computational optimization is becoming a standard tool that is widely used in engineering design and industrial applications. Products and services are often concerned with the maximization of profits and reduction of cost, but also aim at being more energy-efficient, environment-friendly and safety-ensured; at the same time they are limited by resources, time and money. Despite of increasing computer power and availability of better simulation packages, there are a number of challenges remaining when applying numerical optimization methods for real-world engineering problems. Also, new challenges emerge when attempting to attack problems whose solution by means of simulation-based optimization was not even possible in the past. This third workshop on Computational Optimization, Modelling and Simulation (COMS 2012) at ICCS 2012 will further summarize the latest developments of optimization and modelling and their applications in science, engineering and industry.

AB  - Vizing's conjecture (open since 1968) relates the product of the domination numbers of two graphs to the domination number of their Cartesian product graph. In this paper, we formulate Vizing's conjecture as a Positivstellensatz existence question. In particular, we select classes of graphs according to their number of vertices and their domination number and encode the conjecture as an ideal/polynomial pair such that the polynomial is non-negative on the variety associated with the ideal if and only if the conjecture is true for this graph class. Using semidefinite programming we obtain numeric sum-of-squares certificates, which we then manage to transform into symbolic certificates confirming non-negativity of our polynomials. Specifically, we obtain exact low-degree sparse sum-of-squares certificates for particular classes of graphs. The obtained certificates allow generalizations for larger graph classes. Besides computational verification of these more general certificates, we also present theoretical proofs as well as conjectures and questions for further investigations.

AB  - Information technology is evolving fast and steady over the years providing more and more tools for society to use. There is an increasing need and implementation of computation in the conduct of modern scientific research and experimentation. Computational thinking has been scarcely understood by STEM undergraduates if their majors are not computer sciences. We explore computation projects into existing courses via visualization computational tools to increase the number of STEM students who graduate with discipline specific computational skills. The goal of this paper was to report our efforts for increasing the number of students with experience using computation in science. Discipline specific tools were chosen and implemented in the respective courses, for example Chemsketch in chemistry. Hands-on labs were designed to familiarize instructors and students so it can be helpful to smooth the learning curve in STEM undergraduate students

AB  - The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) defines bioinformatics as “… the field of science in which biology, computer science, and information technology merge to form a single discipline”. As such, the field of bioinformatics includes computer scientists who develop algorithms for sequence analysis, biostatisticians who develop and implement methods of analyses for large clinical datasets, mathematicians or physical scientists who develop models to describe the interactions of genes, proteins, and small molecules within cells, and all those engaged in the development of software and databases for manipulation, storage, and retrieval of information in support of their research. This chapter focuses on how computational biology has been enabled by molecular informatics to provide the basis for in silico studies that facilitate the collection, organization, and analysis of datasets that explain biological phenomena and that help to drive biological discovery with applications in precision medicine.

AB  - Recent work on decision-making field offers an account of dual-system theory for decision-making process. This theory holds that this process is conducted by two main controllers: a goal-directed system and a habitual system. In the reinforcement learning (RL) domain, the habitual behaviors are connected with model-free methods, in which appropriate actions are learned through trial-and-error experiences. However, goal-directed behaviors are associated with model-based methods of RL, in which actions are selected using a model of the environment. Studies on cognitive control also suggest that during processes like decision-making, some cortical and subcortical structures work in concert to monitor the consequences of decisions and to adjust control according to current task demands. Here a computational model is presented based on dual system theory and cognitive control perspective of decision-making. The proposed model is used to simulate human performance on a variant of probabilistic learning task. The basic proposal is that the brain implements a dual controller, while an accompanying monitoring system detects some kinds of conflict including a hypothetical cost-conflict one. The simulation results address existing theories about two event-related potentials, namely error related negativity (ERN) and feedback related negativity (FRN), and explore the best account of them. Based on the results, some testable predictions are also presented.

AB  - Pattern separation is a basic principle of neuronal coding that precludes memory interference in the hippocampus. Its existence is supported by numerous theoretical, computational, and experimental findings in different species. However, I argue that recent evidence from single-neuron recordings suggests that pattern separation may not be present in the human hippocampus and that memories are instead coded by the coactivation of invariant and context-independent engrams. This alternative model prompts a reassessment of the definition of episodic memory and its distinction from semantic memory. Furthermore, I propose that a lack of pattern separation in memory coding may have profound implications that could explain cognitive abilities that are uniquely developed in humans, such as our power of generalization and of creative and abstract thinking.

AB  - The bronchial network of the mammalian lung consists of millions of dichotomous branches arranged in a highly complex, space-filling tree. Recent computational models of branching morphogenesis in the lung have helped uncover the biological mechanisms that construct this ramified architecture. In this review, we focus on three different theoretical approaches – geometric modeling, reaction-diffusion modeling, and continuum mechanical modeling – and discuss how, taken together, these models have identified the geometric principles necessary to build an efficient bronchial network, as well as the patterning mechanisms that specify airway geometry in the developing embryo. We emphasize models that are integrated with biological experiments and suggest how recent progress in computational modeling has advanced our understanding of airway branching morphogenesis.

An engineering problem is provided as a surveillance mission with multiple quadrotors autonomously searching, detecting, and tracking ground vehicles. The course covers all stages of multi-agent autonomy development, from identiflying system requirements, designing software and hardware, to conducting demonstrations in a drone flying arena. During the course, students improve their ability to critically formulate, solve and evaluate engineering problems as well as gain and apply technical knowledge in all aspects of autonomy such as fight dynamics, control, navigation, guidance, task allocation, situational awareness and communication. The paper details the problem design, course timeline, outcomes, and key lessons learnt from the course.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used in the field of early childhood education (ECE) to enhance learning and development among young children. Previous proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that AI can effectively improve teaching and learning in ECE; however, there is a scarcity of knowledge about how these studies are conducted and how AI is used across these studies. We conducted this scoping review to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children's concepts regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking. Future directions are also discussed for researching AI in ECE.

We enrich STLC with a type for representing effectful computations alongside with operations to create and process values of this type. The calculus is motivated by natural language modelling, and especially semantic representation. Traditionally, the meaning of a sentence is calculated using λ-terms, but some semantic phenomena need more flexibility. In this article we introduce the calculus and show that the calculus respects the laws of algebraic structures and it enjoys strong normalisation. To do so, confluence is proven using the Combinatory Reduction Systems (CRSs) of Klop and termination using the Inductive Data Type Systems (IDTSs) of Blanqui.

An application of multi-group latent class analysis for examining performance of the networks is described and these results reveal fundamental functional characteristics of the networks. Evidence is provided that strongly suggests that the networks are unable to acquire a mastery of torque and, although they do recover certain rules of operation that humans do, they also show a propensity to acquire rules never previously seen.

For higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for the development of software applications, which not only contribute to the knowledge of programming languages but also to opening guidelines for computational thinking. However, selecting a proper tool can be complex. Especially for the diversity of alternatives on the web. Further, not all of them meet basic usability requirements. In this study, we present a set of platforms that seek to develop programming skills based on video games. The search consisted of 4 stages: (i) definition of the research questions, (ii) scope review, (iii) execution of search and (iv) platform selection. Finally, we employ a usability heuristic evaluation for a novice programming system to determine best practices.

AB  - The design-research illustrated in this research article focus on the emerging field of interactive architecture focusing on developing real-time information exchanging architectural bodies. These interactive bodies demonstrate a fusion between the material, the electronic and the digital domains. This fusion is explicitly attained through a synergistic merger between the fields of ambient sensing, control systems, ubiquitous computing, architectural design, pneumatic systems and computation. The resultant spatial bodies are thus visualised as complex adaptive systems, continually engaged in activities of data-exchange resulting in physical and ambient adaptations of their constituting components in response to contextual variations. Interdependent nodal networks, where every node/junction of a spatial prototype becomes a potential information hub by means of its ability to collect, process and communicate contextual data apart from working as an actuated detail owing to its ability to kinetically re-position itself in three-dimensional space is thus a critical outcome of this inter-disciplinary way of working. A strategy apt for binding material logistics with the digital to materialize dynamic spatial behaviours owing to real time data exchange between the prototypes and their context is thus embarked upon via three research and design projects, namely: Electronic Media Augmented Spatial Skins, The InteractiveWall and the Muscle Re-configured.

KW  - Quantum computation
KW  - Quantum computational logics
KW  - Epistemic operators
AB  - Quantum computation has suggested new forms of quantum logic, called quantum computational logics. In these logics well-formed formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information: possible pure states of quantum systems that can store the information in question. At the same time, the logical connectives are interpreted as quantum logical gates: unitary operators that process quantum information in a reversible way, giving rise to quantum circuits. Quantum computational logics have been mainly studied as sentential logics (whose alphabet consists of atomic sentences and of logical connectives). In this article we propose a semantic characterization for a first-order epistemic quantum computational logic, whose language can express sentences like “Alice knows that everybody knows that she is pretty”. One can prove that (unlike the case of logical connectives) both quantifiers and epistemic operators cannot be generally represented as (reversible) quantum logical gates. The “act of knowing” and the use of universal (or existential) assertions seem to involve some irreversible “theoretic jumps”, which are similar to quantum measurements. Since all epistemic agents are characterized by specific epistemic domains (which contain all pieces of information accessible to them), the unrealistic phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided: knowing a given sentence does not imply knowing all its logical consequences.

AB  - This paper introduces Graded Computation Tree Logic with finite path semantics (GCTLf⁎, for short), a variant of Computation Tree Logic CTL⁎, in which path quantifiers are interpreted over finite paths and can count the number of such paths. State formulas of GCTLf⁎ are interpreted over Kripke structures. The syntax of GCTLf⁎ has path quantifiers of the form E≥gψ which express that there are at least g many distinct finite paths that satisfy ψ. After defining and justifying the logic GCTLf⁎, we solve its model checking problem and establish that its computational complexity is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we investigate GCTLf⁎ under the imperfect information setting. Precisely, we introduce GCTLKf⁎, an epistemic extension of GCTLf⁎ and prove that the model checking problem also in this case is PSPACE-complete.

AB  - Biomethane and hydrogen are acknowledged as transformative opportunities for decarbonizing the conventional gas grid. Essential to this transformation is the modeling of the gaseous fuel supply chain, particularly with hydrogen and biomethane, offering crucial insights for decision-makers. This study introduces a life cycle thinking-based multi-objective optimization model for the integrated design of biomethane and hydrogen gaseous fuel supply chain networks. The model determines optimal resource allocation for the production of the two fuels, integrating them into the conventional gas network. Moreover, it allocates conventional natural gas, biomethane, and hydrogen optimally across building, industry, and transport sectors, considering the life cycle environmental and economic performance of fuel integration paths. Objective functions include minimization of life cycle emissions and levelized cost of energy while maximizing revenue from fuel sales. Integrating life cycle assessment and cost analysis tools, the optimization model quantifies emissions and life cycle costs for biomethane and hydrogen paths. Results identify Pareto-optimal fuel production paths and portfolios, revealing that integrating the alternative fuels into the current gas grid can significantly reduce emissions (up to 250 tonCO2eq/year) and generate substantial carbon tax savings (up to $16,250/year). This model is useful for gaseous fuel industry stakeholders, offering a comprehensive view of supply chain costs and detailed insights into emission benefits when integrating alternative fuels into existing gas networks.

AB  - Fault diagnosis is a key process to ensure reliable and cost-effective performance of time-critical engineered systems. This article develops a data-driven computational model for adaptive fault diagnosis by drawing an analogy with the neurobiological process of conscious attention—a dynamic process that brings only the most novel 0.01% of the signals we receive with our five senses to our conscious experience. A model of conscious attention based on the theory of dynamic core hypothesis is first outlined, followed by a computational model that mimics key stages of the conscious attention process. Convolutional neural networks serve as a basis for modeling perceptual categorization and concept formation through automatic feature extraction, due to their analogy with the processes of neural group selection and reentry in the brain. Further, the process of incremental learning and its impact on signal novelty are modeled via transfer learning. The model is tested on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine model, which indicated 95–99% fault diagnosis accuracy. This study aims at familiarizing the engineering community with the neurobiological process of conscious attention and its applications for adaptive process monitoring and improvement in engineered systems.

We describe how to use the recently developed Gröbner Cover algorithm to study envelopes of families of algebraic curves, and we give a protocol towards its implementation in dynamic geometry environments. The proposal is illustrated through some examples. A beta version of GeoGebra is used to highlight new envelope abilities in interactive environments, and limitations of our approach are discussed, since the computations are performed in an algebraically closed field.

AB  - We propose a framework for testing the effects of changes in bank resolution regimes on bank behavior. By exploiting the differential relevance of recent changes in U.S. bank resolution (i.e., the introduction of the Orderly Liquidation Authority, OLA) for different types of banks, we are able to simulate a quasi-natural experiment using a difference-in-difference framework. We find that banks that are more affected by the introduction of the OLA (1) significantly decrease their overall risk-taking and (2) shift their loan origination toward lower risk, indicating the general effectiveness of the regime change. This effect, however, does (3) not hold for the largest and most systemically important banks. Hence, the introduction of the OLA in the U.S. alone does not appear to have solved the too-big-to-fail problem and might need to be complemented with other measures to limit financial institutions’ risk-taking.

AB  - The kinetochore drives chromosome segregation at cell division. It acts as a physical link between chromosomes and dynamic microtubules, and as a signaling hub detecting and processing microtubule attachments to control anaphase onset. The mammalian kinetochore is a large macromolecular machine that forms a dynamic interface with the many microtubules that it binds. While we know most of the kinetochore’s component parts, how they work together to give rise to its robust functions remains poorly understood. Here we highlight recent findings that shed light on this question, driven by an expanding physical and molecular toolkit. We present emerging principles that underlie the kinetochore’s robust microtubule grip, such as redundancy, specialization, and dynamicity, and present signal processing principles that connect this microtubule grip to robust computation. Throughout, we identify open questions, and define simple engineering concepts that provide insight into kinetochore function.

AB  - Simultaneous recordings from populations of neurons in the inferior temporal visual cortex show that most of the information about which stimulus was shown is available in the number of spikes (or firing rate) of each neuron, and not from stimulus-dependent synchrony, so that it is unlikely that stimulus-dependent synchrony (or indeed oscillations) is an essential aspect of visual object perception. Neurophysiological investigations of backward masking show that the threshold for conscious visual perception may be set to be higher than the level at which small but significant information is present in neuronal firing and which allows humans to guess which stimulus was shown without conscious awareness. The adaptive value of this may be that the systems in the brain that implement the type of information processing involved in conscious thoughts are not interrupted by small signals that could be noise in sensory pathways. I then consider what computational processes are closely related to conscious processing, and describe a higher order syntactic thought (HOST) computational theory of consciousness. It is argued that the adaptive value of higher order thoughts is to solve the credit assignment problem that arises if a multistep syntactic plan needs to be corrected. It is then suggested that it feels like something to be an organism that can think about its own linguistic, and semantically-based thoughts. It is suggested that qualia, raw sensory and emotional feels, arise secondarily to having evolved such a higher order thought system, and that sensory and emotional processing feels like something because it would be unparsimonious for it to enter the planning, higher order thought, system and not feel like something.

Natural computing is not only a new hotspot in artificial intelligence research, but also a new thinking in the development of artificial intelligence. It is also a new achievement in the transformation of methodology. Its research results include evolutionary algorithms, artificial immune system, multiobjective optimization, and so on. Natural computing can solve many complex problems which are difficult to be solved by traditional computing methods. It has good application prospects in solving large-scale complex optimization problems, intelligent control, computer network security, and other fields.

Computational models can be used to interpret experimental data in new ways, to confirm and extend existing hypotheses, and to generate new hypotheses for the function of neural systems. These hypotheses provide links between levels of description, from the molecular level to the systems level. Hypotheses that are tested and validated provide a conceptual framework that can lead to more abstract theories. The ultimate aim of theoretical and computational neuroscience is to provide linking principles from neural mechanisms to behavior.

AB  - The literature on weak signals (WS) has been fruitful in recent years and this specific type of information has attracted the attention of several disciplines, notably the futures studies. However, most of these studies still focus on conceptual discussions, terminology, or the proposal for frameworks that do not take advantage of the evolution of information and communication technologies. In this paper, authors discussed the lack of tools to computationally support WS handling. In response to this lack, a computational tool was developed considering a previously published method for WS classification based on conceptual systems. This tool was applied and evaluated in experimental cases about surprising events that occurred in politics in recent years, considering traditional metrics of information retrieval. Experiments illustrate that organizations can create several conceptual systems to represent different scenarios and types of knowledge; after all, results showed that the tool can operate according to different artifacts of knowledge representation. This capacity is useful to mitigate the effects of the surveillance filter though the evidence does not directly confirm its usefulness for the monitoring activities. Furthermore, the tool provides a list of threats, opportunities and unlabeled WS that can trigger other steps of sensemaking about these signals.

AB  - In The Image of the City Lynch describes how individuals perceive and recall features in urban spaces. The most distinctive elements in the urban landscape - categorised in paths, nodes, edges, districts and landmarks - give shape to individuals' mental representation of the city. Lynch’s approach has stimulated research into spatial cognition, urban design and artificial intelligence, and it still represents an essential pillar in the analysis of urban dynamics. Nevertheless, an explicit link between The Image of the City and GIScience has not been completely explored yet. In this paper, a computational approach to The Image of the City is proposed. Different perspectives in spatial cognition and GIS research are integrated to obtain a complete Image of the City, in which the most salient elements are shared by a large part of citizens. Nodes, paths and districts were identified through network science techniques. Methods drawn from the information approach to The Image of the City are used to detect landmarks, integrating the complexity of points of reference in their visual, structural and semantic components, as conceptualised by Lynch and successive research. The methods were applied to the central area of Boston and built using freely available spatial datasets. Results were compared to Lynch’s maps to evaluate the methodology: besides a considerable discrepancy with regard to landmarks, a good correspondence for paths, nodes, edges and districts was found.

AB  - Question-asking, an underexplored aspect of creativity, is integral to creative problem-solving and information-seeking. Previous research reveals that lower creativity correlates with asking simpler, closed questions, while higher creativity correlates with complex, open-ended inquiries. The present study explores the relation between question asking complexity and problem-solving tasks involving open- and close-ended thinking and how these abilities generalize and compare to AI. In Study 1, participants (N = 89) completed the alternative questions task (AQT), a close-ended riddles task (Stumpers), and the alternate uses task (AUT), a creativity measure. Our results show AQT question complexity wasn't correlated with stumpers performance, although it correlated with AUT originality (r = .3). In Study 2, participants (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, and open-ended creative problem-solving (CPS) task. CPS responses were evaluated for originality and quality. A positive correlation was observed between CPS quality and AQT complexity (r = .29) and originality (r = .34). In study 3, AI agents (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, stumpers, and CPS tasks. Like humans, AI's AQT originality and complexity were related with open, but not closed problem-solving. AI questions were also significantly more creative and complex, it solved more stumpers and gave higher quality CPS solutions. Surprisingly, human and AI CPS originality didn't differ. We find significant links between question complexity and open—but not closed-ended—problem-solving in humans, which generalize to AI. Our results highlight the significance of complex and creative question-asking in everyday life and as an integral part of our problem-solving toolkit.

AB  - Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.

AB  - In the past decade, architectural education has seen an increasing amount of digital technologies being involved in the design studio curricula. Following the trends in the profession, these various technologies of computer aided drafting, enumerating, modeling, and analysis became not only key pedagogical nodes in the design studio, but also started to shape the overall curricular structure of architectural education as they also needed to be implemented as support courses in order to compensate the learning curves and the number of software available to architects. These digital technologies range from one end of simple drafting, conventional three dimensional modeling, and more sophisticated animation of buildings with a computer, to the other end of inventing new tectonic and spatial geometries using parametric computations. In this context, it will be unrealistic to argue against teaching and using digital technologies in architectural education. When one thinks how the profession has evolved in the past decade, it is necessary to embrace these tools in the architectural curriculum. However, a discussion that has not been clearly resolved is when, where, and how these digital tools are thought and used in the architectural education. My paper argues that the conventional tools of hand drawing, physical modeling, and hand making should be embraced in the foundational levels, and the digital tools should be introduced after developing a certain set of skills of one-to-one physical making where a sense of tectonic resolution, scale, and spatial experience is cultivated as a basis of architectural thinking with digital tools. In what follows, I will discuss this viewpoint through examples from architectural design studio education in the United States and in Turkey.

AB  - The intrinsic electrochemistry of platinum and other platinum-group metals and noble metals has been under intense investigation for over forty years but is still not fully understood. Various in situ spectroscopic techniques, particularly vibrational spectroscopies, have provided and continue to provide many insights, but challenges remain. The intrinsic electrochemistry is capable of being elucidated through the combination of electrochemistry, vibrational spectroscopy and theory and is then further able to clarify the catalytic reactions involved in H2–O2 fuel cells and water electrolysis.

AB  - Progress towards understanding how social media impacts body image hinges on the use of appropriate measurement tools and methodologies. This review provides an overview of common (qualitative, self-report survey, lab-based experiments) and emerging (momentary assessment, computational) methodological approaches to the exploration of the impact of social media on body image. The potential of these methodologies is detailed, with examples illustrating current use as well as opportunities for expansion. A key theme from our review is that each methodology has provided insights for the body image research field, yet is insufficient in isolation to fully capture the nuance and complexity of social media experiences. Thus, in consideration of gaps in methodology, we emphasise the need for big picture thinking that leverages and combines the strengths of each of these methodologies to yield a more comprehensive, nuanced, and robust picture of the positive and negative impacts of social media.

AB  - Focusing on the opposing ways of thinking of philosophers and scientists to explain the generation of form in biological development, I show that today's controversies over explanations of early development bear fundamental similarities to the dichotomy of preformation theory versus epigenesis in Greek antiquity. They are related to the acceptance or rejection of the idea of a physical form of what today would be called information for the generating of the embryo as a necessary pre-requisite for specific development and heredity. As a recent example, I scrutinize the dichotomy of genomic causality versus self-organization in 20th and 21st century theories of the generation of form. On the one hand, the generation of patterns and form, as well as the constant outcome in development, are proposed to be causally related to something that is "preformed" in the germ cells, the nucleus of germ cells, or the genome. On the other hand, it is proposed that there is no pre-existing form or information, and development is seen as a process where genuinely new characters emerge from formless matter, either by immaterial "forces of life," or by physical-chemical processes of self-organization. I also argue that these different ways of thinking and the research practices associated with them are not equivalent, and maintain that it is impossible to explain the generation of form and constant outcome of development without the assumption of the transmission of pre-existing information in the form of DNA sequences in the genome. Only in this framework of "preformed" information can "epigenesis" in the form of physical and chemical processes of self-organization play an important role.

AB  - Language understanding and mathematics understanding are two fundamental forms of human thinking. Prior research has largely focused on the question of how language shapes mathematical thinking. The current study considers the converse question. Specifically, it investigates whether the magnitude representations that are thought to anchor understanding of number are also recruited to understand the meanings of graded words. These are words that come in scales (e.g., Anger) whose members can be ordered by the degree to which they possess the defining property (e.g., calm, annoyed, angry, furious). Experiment 1 uses the comparison paradigm to find evidence that the distance, ratio, and boundary effects that are taken as evidence of the recruitment of magnitude representations extend from numbers to words. Experiment 2 uses a similarity rating paradigm and multi-dimensional scaling to find converging evidence for these effects in graded word understanding. Experiment 3 evaluates an alternative hypothesis – that these effects for graded words simply reflect the statistical structure of the linguistic environment – by using machine learning models of distributional word semantics: LSA, word2vec, GloVe, counterfitted word vectors, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. These models fail to show the full pattern of effects observed of humans in Experiment 2, suggesting that more is needed than mere statistics. This research paves the way for further investigations of the role of magnitude representations in sentence and text comprehension, and of the question of whether language understanding and number understanding draw on shared or independent magnitude representations. It also informs the role of machine learning models in cognitive psychology research.

AB  - Unlike vertebrate animals, invertebrates lack lymphocytes and therefore have historically been believed not to develop immune memory. A few studies have reported evidence of immune priming in insects; however, these studies lack the molecular mechanism and proposed it might be different among taxa. Since lncRNAs are known to regulate the immune response, we identified 10,120 lncRNAs in Tribolium castaneum genome-wide followed by transcriptome analysis of primed and unprimed larvae of different infectious status. A shift in lncRNA expression between Btt primed larvae and other treatment groups provides evidence of immune memory response. A few “priming” lncRNAs (n = 9) were uniquely regulated in Btt primed larvae. Evidence suggests these lncRNAs are likely controlling immune priming in Tribolium by regulating expression of genes involved in proteasomal machinery, Notch system, zinc metabolism, and methyltransferase activity, which are necessary to modulate phagocytosis. Our results support a conserved immune priming mechanism in a macrophage-dependent manner.

AB  - In this article we review Per Linell's work within the last five decades that led to his dialogism framework, which he defines as a general epistemology of language, cognition and communication. We critically discuss how his contribution on the one hand, altered and qualified existent models within language, communication and cognitive science, because dialogism removed language and cognition from their abstract and mental seat in the brain, and embedded them instead in situational contexts and embodied interaction. In that sense, his dialogism successfully replaced monological assumptions about the mind, action and thinking with more contextual and temporally distributed ones. On the other hand, we also question why Linell has not pursued a more rigorous empirical program for studying human cognition, when he did establish a theoretical apparatus for approaching cognition from a dialogical starting point. In going through Linell's arguments over the past five decades we suggest that this absence of an empirical program is due to his humanistic roots which both have sensitised him to appreciating the contingencies and dynamics of human sense making and cognition, and have impeded him from buying into a necessary condition for pursuing a cognitive analysis, even if he conceptually and methodologically accepts a distributed view on cognition. The outcome of this discussion leads to an empirical-based cognitive analysis of a medical interaction. Altogether, the purpose of this article is to show how Linell's conceptual framework can be put to use in ways that make a dialogical cognitive science achievable.

AB  - AI has long been regarded as a panacea for decision-making and many other aspects of knowledge work; as something that will help humans get rid of their shortcomings. We believe that AI can be a useful asset to support decision-makers, but not that it should replace decision-makers. Decision-making uses algorithmic analysis, but it is not solely algorithmic analysis; it also involves other factors, many of which are very human, such as creativity, intuition, emotions, feelings, and value judgments. We have conducted semi-structured open-ended research interviews with 17 dermatologists to understand what they expect from an AI application to deliver to medical diagnosis. We have found four aggregate dimensions along which the thinking of dermatologists can be described: the ways in which our participants chose to interact with AI, responsibility, ‘explainability’, and the new way of thinking (mindset) needed for working with AI. We believe that our findings will help physicians who might consider using AI in their diagnosis to understand how to use AI beneficially. It will also be useful for AI vendors in improving their understanding of how medics want to use AI in diagnosis. Further research will be needed to examine if our findings have relevance in the wider medical field and beyond.

AB  - Literature search across different databases showed that the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment has been extensively studied. On the commercial front, Internet search suggested that numerous AI-equipped HVAC products have been launched. These products apply AI in very different ways, and their energy-saving effects are also different. Such divergence and uncertain energy-saving effects may hinder AI application. To overcome this difference and accelerate the development of AI applications, the present study proposed a double diamond preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) method—an analysis method that combined literature review with design thinking. Through a process of divergence-convergence-re-divergence, this study described how to design AI functions for energy-efficient HVAC systems, taking into account more than 1,700 research papers it had reviewed. However, there was a limitation on the part re-divergence. Because the vast majority of research papers only published results of successful AI applications, no cases of failed applications were available for review, making it impossible to re-think profoundly. Instead, this study collected raw data from 88 research papers and used these data to analyze the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of AI in depth. It was concluded that AI application must be accompanied by necessary hardware improvements to achieve effective energy savings. AI-enabled energy-saving effects for chillers, air-handing units, heating systems, and air conditioners, as well as corresponding hardware upgrades, were discussed.

AB  - The Fourier Transform is one of the most important linear transformations used in science and engineering. Cooley and Tukey's Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from 1964 is a method for computing this transformation in time O(nlog⁡n). From a lower bound perspective, relatively little is known. Ailon shows in 2013 an Ω(nlog⁡n) bound for computing the normalized Fourier Transform assuming only unitary operations on two coordinates are allowed at each step, and no extra memory is allowed. In 2014, Ailon then improved the result to show that, in a κ-well conditioned computation, Fourier computation can be sped up by no more than O(κ). The main conjecture is that Ailon's result can be exponentially improved, in the sense that κ-well condition cannot admit ω(log⁡κ) speedup. The main result here is that ‘algebraic’ κ-well condition cannot admit ω(κ) speedup. One equivalent definition of algebraic condition number is related to the degree of polynomials naturally arising as the computation evolves. Using the maximum modulus theorem from complex analysis, we show that algebraic condition number upper bounds standard condition number, and equals it in certain cases. Algebraic condition number is an interesting measure of numerical computation stability in its own right, and provides a novel computational lens. Moreover, based on evidence from other recent related work, we believe that the approach of algebraic condition number has a good chance of establishing an algebraic version of the main conjecture.

AB  - A variety of anatomical and physiological evidence suggests that the brain performs computations using motifs that are repeated across species, brain areas, and modalities. The computational architecture of cortex, for example, is very similar from one area to another and the types, arrangements, and connections of cortical neurons are highly stereotyped. This supports the idea that each cortical area conducts calculations using similarly structured neuronal modules: what we term canonical computational motifs. In addition, the remarkable self-similarity of the brain observables at the micro-, meso- and macro-scale further suggests that these motifs are repeated at increasing spatial and temporal scales supporting brain activity from primary motor and sensory processing to higher-level behaviour and cognition. Here, we briefly review the biological bases of canonical brain circuits and the role of inhibitory interneurons in these computational elements. We then elucidate how canonical computational motifs can be repeated across spatial and temporal scales to build a multiplexing information system able to encode and transmit information of increasing complexity. We point to the similarities between the patterns of activation observed in primary sensory cortices by use of electrophysiology and those observed in large scale networks measured with fMRI. We then employ the canonical model of brain function to unify seemingly disparate evidence on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in a single explanatory framework. We hypothesise that such a framework may also be extended to cover multiple brain disorders which are grounded in dysfunction of GABA interneurons and/or these computational motifs.

AB  - Summary
In this Review, we discuss advances in computational neuroscience that relate to psychiatry. We review computational psychiatry in terms of the ambitions of investigators, emerging domains of application, and future work. Our focus is on theoretical formulations of brain function that put subjective beliefs and behaviour within formal (computational) frameworks—frameworks that can be grounded in neurophysiology down to the level of synaptic mechanisms. Understanding the principles that underlie the brain's functional architecture might be essential for an informed phenotyping of psychopathology in terms of its pathophysiological underpinnings. We focus on active (Bayesian) inference and predictive coding. Specifically, we show how basic principles of neuronal computation can be used to explain psychopathology, ranging from impoverished theory of mind in autism to abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye movements in schizophrenia.

AB  - Hydrocarbons in subsurface nanoporous media, such as shale, are promising energy resources to compensate for the shortage of conventional reservoirs. Pore-network modeling serves as a valuable tool for simulating microscale fluid transport and elucidating flow physics in porous media. However, traditional pore-network models have failed to capture features of spatial structure and fluid flow in unconventional shale rock. This work presents a critical review of pore-network modeling of single-phase and two-phase flow in shale rock. Pore-network modeling advances of shale are reviewed based on three major parts: network morphology and geometries, flow principles in nanocapillaries, and pore-network computational algorithms. First, based on key geological features of shale rock, we analyze network topology, multiscale network, pore geometries, and network representativeness of shale pore-network models. Then, we discuss four important aspects that may influence flow principles of fluids in nanocapillaries: gas and liquid slippage, sorption and diffusion behavior, hydrocarbon thermodynamics, and the presence of water. Finally, we present pore-network modeling methods used for flow simulations in shale rock, including quasi-static and dynamic algorithms. We hope that this review could shed light on fundamentals of pore-network modeling of shale rock.

At the same time, emotion theorists and clinical psychologists have begun to recognize the importance of moving beyond descriptive characterizations of psychopathology, and identifying the underlying mechanisms that mediate both the etiology of affective disorders, and their treatment: the transdiagnostic approach to psychopathology. Computational models of cognition–emotion interactions have the potential to facilitate more accurate assessment and diagnosis of affective disorders, and to provide a basis for more efficient and targeted approaches to their treatment, through an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art in modeling emotion–cognition interaction and the relevance of these models for understanding the mechanisms mediating psychopathology and therapeutic action. The discussion is limited to symbolic models and theories defined at the psychological, versus neural, level. The chapter also outlines how these models can support the development of serious therapeutic games, to enhance assessment and treatment methods in behavioral healthcare.

AB  - In the recent years, the vast amount of genetic information generated by new-generation approaches, have led to the need of new data handling methods. The integrative analysis of diverse-nature gene information could provide a much-sought overview to study complex biological systems and processes. In this sense, Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) arise as an increasingly-promising tool for the modelling and analysis of biological processes. This review is an attempt to summarize the state of the art in the field of GRNs. Essential points in the field are addressed, thereof: (a) the type of data used for network generation, (b) machine learning methods and tools used for network generation, (c) model optimization and (d) computational approaches used for network validation. This survey is intended to provide an overview of the subject for readers to improve their knowledge in the field of GRN for future research.

KW  - Three-way decision
AB  - The presence of multiple criteria for evaluating wastewater reuse applications indicates the potential usage of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods for this purpose. However, there is currently a scarcity of studies in the domain literature that utilize MCDM approaches in this application topic. This paper therefore advances the domain literature in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it analyzes and advances the reuse agenda of wastewater from thermal power plants, recognized as large-scale users of water, thus promoting greater water circularity. Secondly, it provides a methodological advance by integrating the notion of Three-Way Decision (3WD) into the computational structure of MCDM methods by introducing a middle reference point. Such an initiative results in a novel 3WD extension of the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method. Additionally, this work provides a proof that the MARCOS method utilizes a compromise solution in identifying priority alternatives, along with the integration of a Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) metric. An initial hypothetical example illustrates how the proposed approach augments the canonical MARCOS method, particularly in promoting the “thinking in threes” as a more natural information processing approach and the high degree of distinguishability of priorities between decision alternatives. An actual case study in a thermal power plant then demonstrates the contributions of this work. With the best-worst method used to determine the priorities of the decision attributes, the findings reveal that wastewater reuse applications achieving reduced costs for needed infrastructures, operational simplicity, technological compatibility, consumer safety and household savings are preferred by stakeholders. The 3WD-MARCOS approach identifies industrial and commercial use, municipal use, environmental restoration, and household use as the high-priority alternatives, with cooking and drinking as least preferred. These insights guide stakeholders in their design of initiatives that allocate resources for greater wastewater reuse. A comparative analysis yields high consistency of these findings with similar MCDM methods. In addition, the efficacy of the novel 3WD-MARCOS method highlights its potential in handling MCDM problems, including those promoting water circularity.

AB  - This paper examines the recent emergence of AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT through the lens of the Cognitive Mediation Networks Theory (CMNT), deducing that the introduction of this radically new technology will likely create a new stage of collective cognitive functioning, called “Sophotechnic Mediation”, with characteristics that can be extrapolated from the way these new tools work and the dynamics of the sociocultural structures being created around them. From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.

The primary computational primitives of the brain are described, and their implementation in anatomy and physiology discussed. Combinations and sequences of these primitives implement cognitive tasks. Many of the primitives have also been implemented electronically. The brain is a very effective general learning system, and although an artificial general intelligence system will be required to learn a different range of behaviours from the brain, the computational primitives used by the brain are the best available guide to appropriate primitives for such an AGI system.

AB  - Diphosphonioalkylidene dianions have emerged as highly effective ligands for lanthanide and actinide ions, and the resulting formal metal–carbon double bonds have challenged and developed conventional thinking about f-element bond multiplicity and covalency. However, f-element–diphosphonioalkylidene complexes can be represented by several resonance forms that render their metal–carbon double bond status unclear. Here, we report an experimentally-validated 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance computational assessment of two cerium(iv)–diphosphonioalkylidene complexes, [Ce(BIPMTMS)(ODipp)2] (, BIPMTMS = {C(PPh2NSiMe3)2}2−; Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and [Ce(BIPMTMS)2] (). Decomposing the experimental alkylidene chemical shifts into their corresponding calculated shielding (σ) tensor components verifies that these complexes exhibit CeC double bonds. Strong magnetic coupling of CeC σ/π* and π/σ* orbitals produces strongly deshielded σ11 values, a characteristic hallmark of alkylidenes, and the largest 13C chemical shift tensor spans of any alkylidene complex to date (, 801 ppm; , 810 ppm). In contrast, the phosphonium-substituent shielding contributions are much smaller than the CeC σ- and π-bond components. This study confirms significant Ce 4f-orbital contributions to the CeC bonding, provides further support for a previously proposed inverse-trans-influence in , and reveals variance in the 4f spin–orbit contributions that relate to the alkylidene hybridisation. This work thus confirms the metal–carbon double bond credentials of f-element–diphosphonioalkylidenes, providing quantified benchmarks for understanding diphosphonioalkylidene bonding generally.

AB  - Noninvasive neuroimaging has revolutionized the study of the organization of the human brain and how its structure and function are altered in psychiatric disorders. A critical explanatory gap lies in our mechanistic understanding of how systems-level neuroimaging biomarkers emerge from underlying synaptic-level perturbations associated with a disease state. We describe an emerging computational psychiatry approach leveraging biophysically based computational models of large-scale brain dynamics and their potential integration with clinical and pharmacological neuroimaging. In particular, we focus on neural circuit models, which describe how patterns of functional connectivity observed in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging emerge from neural dynamics shaped by inter-areal interactions through underlying structural connectivity defining long-range projections. We highlight the importance of local circuit physiological dynamics, in combination with structural connectivity, in shaping the emergent functional connectivity. Furthermore, heterogeneity of local circuit properties across brain areas, which impacts large-scale dynamics, may be critical for modeling whole-brain phenomena and alterations in psychiatric disorders and pharmacological manipulation. Finally, we discuss important directions for future model development and biophysical extensions, which will expand their utility to link clinical neuroimaging to neurobiological mechanisms.

AB  - Investigating the nature and components of face attractiveness from a computational view has become an emerging topic in facial analysis research. In this paper, a multi-view (frontal and profile view, 2.5D) facial attractiveness computational model is developed to explore how face geometry affects its attractiveness. A landmark-based, data-driven method is introduced to construct a huge dimension of three kinds of geometric facial measurements, including ratios, angles, and inclinations. An incremental feature selection algorithm is proposed to systematically select the most discriminative subset of geometric features, which are finally mapped to an attractiveness score through the application of support vector regression (SVR). On a dataset of 360 facial images pre-processed from BJUT-3D Face Database and an attractiveness score dataset collected from human raters, we show that the computational model performs well with low statistic error (MSE=0.4969) and good predictability (R2=0.5756).

The considerable heterogeneity of the immune system requires systems approaches to be used to model such a complexity and to respond to questions posed by biomedical audience to help them solve biomedical questions. Computational approaches are increasingly vital to understand the implications of the wealth of gene expression and epigenomics data being gathered from immune cells, and dozens of immune databases play a vital role in organizing the vast quantities of experimental data generated by modern high-throughput technologies. Multi-scale methodologies are increasingly being used to characterise the interplay between the molecular, cellular and organism levels of the immune system. Finally, computational immunology is making an important contribution to an emerging field of computational biomedicine: in silico clinical trials.

AB  - In this work, I propose a new method for the computation of informational entropy from Recurrence Plots when the analyzed time series are categorical in nature. In such cases, there is typically a simplification in choosing the parameters of the analysis, in the sense that no embedding in multidimensional space is usually assumed and that recurrence is restricted to exact matching (equivalence) of the numerically coded categories. However, such a simplified parameterization brings about some notable changes in the appearance of the obtained Recurrence Plots, which has consequences for the extraction of the standard dynamical measures. Specifically, a categorical Recurrence Plot is often composed of rectangular structures rather than line structures (diagonal and horizontal/vertical), over which the recurrence quantification measures were originally proposed. Starting from this observation, I consider alternative computational procedures to extract a non-biased measure of entropy for the categorical case, showing the viability of such a choice with simulated data

AB  - The rapid development of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) in recent years suggests a promise to use electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) for package delivery in metro areas. While eVTOL manufacturers and logistics service providers are actively developing prototype eVTOLs and exploring their potentials for moving freight, a system thinking about the suitability and ways to operate an eVTOL-based package delivery system remains scarce. A key aspect of the system thinking is the noise impact of eVTOL operations on surrounding communities. In this study, we provide an operation planning framework that aims to prepare AAM to be both economically efficient and community friendly for package delivery. We first develop a method to quantify the community noise impact of an eVTOL operation, using a “population exposure” measure which is based on the level of sound generated and accounts for both the number of people impacted and duration of the impact. Then, a bi-objective integer programming model is formulated which simultaneously optimizes total shipping cost and community noise impact of eVTOL operations. The optimization takes into consideration operational constraints including maximum distance for local delivery, latest package departure time from the warehouse, and eVTOL fleet size and carrying capacity. A tailored solution algorithm which augments non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA2) with compact solution representation, guided generation of initial population of solutions, and customized local search heuristics is devised. The model and the algorithm are implemented in a case study in the Chicago metro area. Numerical results reveal the trade-off between the minimization of shipping cost and community noise impact. Several operational insights about eVTOL-based package delivery are obtained. The computational efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm are also demonstrated in comparison with alternative solution methods.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are heterogeneous disorders of the central nervous system that share a chronic and selective process of neuronal cell death. A computational approach to investigate shared genetic and specific loci was applied to 5 different ND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Lewy body dementia (LBD). The datasets were analyzed separately, and then we compared the obtained results. For this purpose, we applied a genetic correlation analysis to genome-wide association datasets and revealed different genetic correlations with several human traits and diseases. In addition, a clumping analysis was carried out to identify SNPs genetically associated with each disease. We found 27 SNPs in AD, 6 SNPs in ALS, 10 SNPs in PD, 17 SNPs in MS, and 3 SNPs in LBD. Most of them are located in non-coding regions, with the exception of 5 SNPs on which a protein structure and stability prediction was performed to verify their impact on disease. Furthermore, an analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs of the 5 examined pathologies was performed to reveal regulatory mechanisms that could involve genes associated with selected SNPs. In conclusion, the results obtained constitute an important step toward the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and a better understanding of the diseases.

AB  - Computing education is increasing in global importance, with calls for greater understanding of conceptual development that can inform pedagogy. Here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of Embodied Cognition. Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors.

AB  - Planarian behavior, physiology, and pattern control offer profound lessons for regenerative medicine, evolutionary biology, morphogenetic engineering, robotics, and unconventional computation. Despite recent advances in the molecular genetics of stem cell differentiation, this model organism’s remarkable anatomical homeostasis provokes us with truly fundamental puzzles about the origin of large-scale shape and its relationship to the genome. In this review article, we first highlight several deep mysteries about planarian regeneration in the context of the current paradigm in this field. We then review recent progress in understanding of the physiological control of an endogenous, bioelectric pattern memory that guides regeneration, and how modulating this memory can permanently alter the flatworm’s target morphology. Finally, we focus on computational approaches that complement reductive pathway analysis with synthetic, systems-level understanding of morphological decision-making. We analyze existing models of planarian pattern control and highlight recent successes and remaining knowledge gaps in this interdisciplinary frontier field.

AB  - Work-integrated learning (WIL) is a pedagogical activity designed to enhance the integration of theoretical knowledge and practical skills in an authentic context. WIL is typically accomplished through work placement, but a non-placement WIL is potentially promising. In this study, a non-placement WIL programme was incorporated into chemical engineering final year projects. The students worked on industrial problems without a work placement. The purpose of the study was to investigate work-related skills learned in a non-placement WIL programme. A qualitative dominant mixed-methods research approach was adopted. Data was collected using a quantitative questionnaire (n = 69) and a qualitative interview (n = 15). Quantitative findings revealed no significant difference between students working on non-placement WIL and academic projects. However, qualitative findings revealed seven insightful work-related skills in the non-placement WIL: (1) professional relationship with industrial experts and academic supervisors, (2) virtual communication and collaboration, (3) technology skills in the latest industrial software and tools, (4) motivation to undertake novel and challenging industrial problems, (5) creative and innovative strategies, (6) application of higher order thinking skills to model authentic problems, (7) inductive and deductive reasoning. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how engineers work. Today, it is a necessity to embrace creative problem-solving skills and adopt various types of modern technologies to work effectively and remotely.

AB  - Developing and testing psychological interventions for primary caregivers of children with cancer at significant psychosocial risk is still needed. One psychological factor contributing to their emotional distress is repetitive negative thinking (RNT). This study conducted a randomized, multiple-baseline evaluation of the effect of an individual, online, 2-session, RNT-focused ACT intervention in 12 parents. Participants responded to daily measures of emotional symptoms, RNT, and progress in values during baseline, intervention, and the 2-month follow-up. These measures have shown adequate psychometric properties at the individual level in this study. All 12 participants completed the intervention. A Bayesian hierarchical model indicated that most participants showed reductions in emotional symptoms and RNT (10 of 11), and 8 of 12 participants showed increases in valued living. The design-comparable standardized mean difference was computed to estimate the intervention effect overall. The effect sizes were large for all variables (PHQ-4: d = 0.83, 95% CI [0.27, 1.40]; RNTQ-3: d = 0.81, 95% CI [0.34, 1.28]; VQ-3: d = 1.07, 95% CI [0.22, 1.91]). Participants evaluated the intervention as useful at the 2-month follow-up. In conclusion, a brief and online RNT-focused intervention showed promising results in parents of children with cancer at significant psychosocial risk.

AB  - In recent years, the application of computational modeling in studies on age-related changes in decision making and learning has gained in popularity. One advantage of computational models is that they provide access to latent variables that cannot be directly observed from behavior. In combination with experimental manipulations, these latent variables can help to test hypotheses about age-related changes in behavioral and neurobiological measures at a level of specificity that is not achievable with descriptive analysis approaches alone. This level of specificity can in turn be beneficial to establish the identity of the corresponding behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms. In this paper, we will illustrate applications of computational methods using examples of lifespan research on risk taking, strategy selection and reinforcement learning. We will elaborate on problems that can occur when computational neuroscience methods are applied to data of different age groups. Finally, we will discuss potential targets for future applications and outline general shortcomings of computational neuroscience methods for research on human lifespan development.

AB  - The epitaxial growth of PtSe2 monolayer has brings new opportunities for the application and development of materials science. Using first-principles calculations, the effect of vacancy defects, and strain engineering on the electronic properties of PtSe2 monolayer are systematically investigated. The results show that the Pt single vacancy induces a large magnetic moment of 4.0 μB on PtSe2 monolayer and transforms it from semiconductor to metal. However, the Se single vacancy systems are nonmagnetic and realize the PtSe2 from an indirect semiconductor to a direct one. Moreover, the band gap of PtSe2 monolayer can be prominently modulated within a appreciable uniaxial strain range, and the band gap are monotonically increase/decrease as decrease/increase the magnitude of the compressive/tensile strain. In particular, when a specific strain applied, a wide and high absorption peak across near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet region. These findings not only enrich the fundamental understanding of PtSe2 monolayer but also provide useful guidance to design PtSe2-based spintronic, optoelectronic and gas sensing applications.

AB  - This paper presents a privacy-preserving system for participatory sensing, which relies on cryptographic techniques and distributed computations in the cloud. Each individual user is represented by a personal software agent, deployed in the cloud, where it collaborates on distributed computations without loss of privacy, including with respect to the cloud service providers. We present a generic system architecture involving a cryptographic protocol based on a homomorphic encryption scheme for aggregating sensing data into maps, and demonstrate security in the Honest-But-Curious model both for the users and the cloud service providers. We validate our system in the context of NoiseTube, a participatory sensing framework for noise pollution, presenting experiments with real and artificially generated data sets, and a demo on a heterogeneous set of commercial cloud providers. To the best of our knowledge our system is the first operational privacy-preserving system for participatory sensing. While our validation pertains to the noise domain, the approach used is applicable in any crowd-sourcing application relying on location-based contributions of citizens where maps are produced by aggregating data – also beyond the domain of environmental monitoring.

AB  - This paper describes the development of EoS Simulator, a cubic equations of state simulator created in the MATLAB R2022b App Designer platform, which aims to be a practical digital tool for chemical engineering students that facilitates the solution, analysis, and critical thinking about thermodynamic problems. In the simulator, numerical algorithms were implemented based on a theoretical framework, such as fugacity test, bracketing methods, and the calculation of residual properties. EoS Simulator can estimate two-phase envelopes, isobars, isotherms, and surfaces related to PTVHS properties. MATLAB Grader courses were proposed to test student learning using the software in two different workshops. The evaluation was based on the achievement of tasks related to intended learning outcomes. Survey responses about the simulator and learning environment were collected, concluding that most students improved their skills in understanding thermodynamics phenomena, but some improvements are necessary for future versions of the software and online courses.

AB  - Computational models of frontal function have made important contributions to understanding how the frontal lobes support a wide range of important functions, in their interactions with other brain areas including, critically, the basal ganglia (BG). We focus here on the specific case of how different frontal areas support goal-directed, motivated decision-making, by representing three essential types of information: possible plans of action (in more dorsal and lateral frontal areas), affectively significant outcomes of those action plans (in ventral, medial frontal areas including the orbital frontal cortex), and the overall utility of a given plan compared to other possible courses of action (in anterior cingulate cortex). Computational models of goal-directed action selection at multiple different levels of analysis provide insight into the nature of learning and processing in these areas and the relative contributions of the frontal cortex versus the BG. The most common neurologic disorders implicate these areas, and understanding their precise function and modes of dysfunction can contribute to the new field of computational psychiatry, within the broader field of computational neuroscience.

AB  - Aims
The Experimental Medicine Approach offers a unique perspective to determine clinical behavior change by engaging a target underlying the cause of a disorder. The present work engaged a novel target of addiction, Reinforcer Pathology, in two studies to test changes in behavior among individuals with cocaine use disorder.
Methods
In Study 1, n = 44 participants engaged the temporal window with episodic future thinking (EFT), a positive prospection exercise. Changes in temporal view and cocaine valuation were tested using delay discounting and behavioral economic demand, respectively. Additionally, a computational model assessed the relative reliance on the near- and far-sighted systems during EFT. In Study 2, n = 71 engaged the temporal window with a negatively-valenced hurricane scenario to test the opposite effects on window length and cocaine valuation.
Results
Results demonstrated systematic and symmetrical engagement of the behavioral target. Study 1 robustly replicated previous work, wherein EFT lengthened the temporal window and decreased cocaine valuation. Moreover, EFT increased the weighting of the modeled far-sighted system, increasing the relative impact of long-term discounting decisions. Study 2 produced opposite outcomes, shortened temporal window and increased cocaine valuation.
Conclusions
This approximately equal and opposite reaction to the manipulations supports reinforcer pathology theory and implicates the temporal window over which rewards are valued as a target to be pushed and pulled to produce clinically meaningful behavior change. Using the Experimental Medicine Approach as a guide, future work should identify new potential interventions to engage reinforcer pathology and use the clinically relevant outcomes as a litmus test for mechanism.

AB  - Metastasis accounts for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths, and is fueled by fine-tuned transitions among many cellular phenotypes. Transitions among epithelial (strong cell–cell adhesion, no or little migration), mesenchymal (no cell–cell adhesion, high migration), and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (both cell–cell adhesion and cell migration) phenotypes are considered to be a hallmark of metastasis. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in mapping the regulatory networks underlying these transitions. This progress has enabled the capability to develop computational systems biology models to characterize how various intracellular and extracellular signals can drive these transitions. Here, we discuss how different mathematical models have contributed to elucidating the underlying principles of these transitions and guided further experiments to address key unanswered questions concerning metastasis.

AB  - The Bayesian Computational Sensor Network methodology is applied to small-scale structural health monitoring. A mobile robot, equipped with vision and ultrasound sensors, maps small-scale structures for damage (e.g., holes, cracks) by localizing itself and the damage in the map. The combination of vision and ultrasound reduces the uncertainty in damage localization. The data storage and analysis takes place exploiting cloud computing mechanisms, and there is also an off-line computational model calibration component which returns information to the robot concerning updated on-board models as well as proposed sampling points. The approach is validated in a set of physical experiments.
