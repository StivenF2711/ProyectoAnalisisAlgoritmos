AB  - In recent years, there has been enormous development in soft computing, especially artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed robust methods for solving complex engineering problems. Researchers in the field of water resources engineering have applied these AI methods to solve a variety of hydrological problems. Despite their widespread use in the surface and atmospheric hydrology fields, groundwater hydrologists have not widely used AI methods in their routine field-scale modeling efforts. This is because AI models have been primarily considered black box models that lack physical meaning. Furthermore, using AI models to generate the space-time distribution of transient groundwater level variations is challenging and requires further flux balance and mass transport analyses. More recently, a new type of physics-informed neural network (PINN) model has been developed to address several limitations by integrating governing physics (groundwater flow equations) into the AI tools. This study presents the systematic advantages of the PINN algorithm for solving groundwater problems using a set of classic test problems. As discussed in detail in the article, these advantages and potentials are associated with the meshless nature of PINN, its continuous time and space dimensions, its independence from time-stepping and incremental marching in space, and its efficiency in running time. However, despite PINN's promising attributes, it is important to acknowledge its nascent stage of development and the inherent limitations of all neural network models, such as training challenges and hyperparameter selection. Thus, collaborative efforts between groundwater modelers and computer scientists are imperative to explore and exploit the full potential of PINN in tackling increasingly complex groundwater problems and nurturing PINN into a dependable modeling tool in industry and academia.

AB  - Power system transient stability prediction (TSP) is particularly important as power systems change and evolve, including the rapid growth of renewable energy, the proliferation of electric vehicles, and the construction of smart grids. Traditional time-domain simulation methods are time-consuming and cannot achieve online prediction. Direct methods are poorly adapted and cannot be applied to complex power systems. Existing machine learning algorithms only classify the transient stability without providing the degree of transient stability of the system. Therefore, a fast and accurate power system TSP method is needed to assist operators in implementing timely measures to improve the stability of the power system running. This study proposes a Mobileception-ResNet network, Mobileception-ResNet is formed by Inception-ResNet-v2, MobileNet-v2, and a fully connected layer. In this study, Mobileception-ResNet and nine comparison models are experimented on two node systems, i.e., the IEEE 10–39 and 69–300 systems. In the IEEE 10–39 system, the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of Mobileception-ResNet are 44.13 %, 36.74 %, and 39.96 % lower, and the coefficient of determination is 0.04 % higher, respectively, when compared to the comparative model with the best evaluation indicator; in the IEEE 69–300 system, the corresponding values are 2.6 %, 12.83 %, 12.55 %, and 0.01 %, respectively.

AB  - The approach of cross-language brain decoding is to use models of brain decoding from one language to decode stimuli of another language. It has the potential to provide new insights into how our brain represents multiple languages. While it is possible to decode semantic information across different languages from neuroimaging data, the approach’s overall success remains to be tested and depends on a number of factors such as cross-language similarity, age of acquisition/proficiency levels, and depth of language processing. We expect to see continued progress in this domain, from a traditional focus on words and concrete concepts toward the use of naturalistic experimental tasks involving higher-level language processing (e.g., discourse processing). The approach can also be applied to understand how cross-modal, cross-cultural, and other nonlinguistic factors may influence neural representations of different languages. This article provides an overview of cross-language brain decoding with suggestions for future research directions.

AB  - If the genome defines the program for the operations of a cell, signaling networks execute it. These cascades of chemical, cell-biological, structural, and trafficking events span milliseconds (e.g., synaptic release) to potentially a lifetime (e.g., stabilization of dendritic spines). In principle almost every aspect of neuronal function, particularly at the synapse, depends on signaling. Thus dysfunction of these cascades, whether through mutations, local dysregulation, or infection, leads to disease. The sheer complexity of these pathways is matched by the range of diseases and the diversity of their phenotypes. In this review, we discuss how to build computational models, how these models are essential to tackle this complexity, and the benefits of using families of models at different levels of detail to understand signaling in health and disease.

AB  - The principle of homology-continuity in Multi-Dimensional Biomimetic Informatics Space is applied to construct the identifying mechanism of category of deep representation of mental imagery. The model of each cerebral region involved in recognizing is established respectively and a feedforward method for establishing category mental imagery is proposed. First, the model of feature acquisition is developed based on Hubel-Wiesel model, and Gaussian function is used to simulate the simple cell receptive field to satisfy the specific function of visual cortex. Second, multiple input aggregation operation is employed to simulate the feature output of complex cells to get the invariance representation in feature space. Then, imagery basis is extracted by unsupervised learning algorithm based on the primary feature and category mental imagery is obtained by building Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Finally, the system model is tested by training set and test set composed of real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can establish valid deep representation of these samples, based on which the biomimetic construction of category mental imagery can be achieved. This method provides a new idea for solving imagery problem and studying imagery thinking.

AB  - Previous studies using multi-voxel pattern analysis have decoded the content of participants' delayed intentions from patterns of fMRI data. Here we investigate whether this technique can be used to decode not only participants' own intentions, but also their representation of the intentions held by other people. In other words: if Sam is thinking about Hoki, can we decode the content of Hoki's intention by scanning Sam's brain? We additionally distinguished two components of intentions: action-plans versus goals, and included novel control analyses that allowed us to distinguish intending an outcome from simply expecting it to occur or simulating its consequences. Regions of frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex contained patterns from which it was possible to decode intentions of both self and other. Furthermore, crossclasification between self and other was possible, suggesting overlap between the two. Control analyses suggested that these results reflected visuo-spatial processes by which intentions were generated in our paradigm, rather than anything special about intentions per se. There was no evidence for any representation of intentions as mental states distinct from visuospatial processes involved in generating their content and/or simulating their outcomes. These findings suggest that the brain activity patterns decoded in intention-decoding fMRI studies may reflect domain-general processes rather than being intention-specific.

AB  - One of the aims of this work is to revise the known issues of how to obtain the value of the expression using an applicative computing system. Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. This allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators.

KW  - Semantic discriminability
AB  - Graph contrastive learning has garnered considerable research interest due to its ability to effectively embed graph data without manual labels. Among them, methods based on Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) have been widely studied and favored in the industry because of their fast training speed, applicability to large-scale data. DGI-based methods usually obtain a noise graph through node shuffling. The proxy task of these methods encourages the encoder to distinguish whether the nodes come from the original graph or the noise graph, thereby maximizing the mutual information between the node representation and the graph it belongs to, while also maximizing the Jenson–Shannon divergence between the nodes of original graph and noise graph. However, we argue that these approaches only enable the encoder to differentiate between semantically meaningful graphs and noise graphs, but not to effectively identify different semantic graphs. This leads to the inability of the encoder to effectively embed information between different semantics, significantly reducing the robustness and affecting the performance of downstream tasks. In addition, this training mode makes the model more sensitive to attacks. To improve their semantic discriminability, we take advantage of the natural ability of generative adversarial networks to generate semantic data, proposing a method called Generative Adversarial Graph Group Discrimination (GA-GGD). Specifically, it consists of a graph group discriminator and a semantic attack generator. The discriminator aims to encode the graph and identify whether nodes originate from the original graph. The goal of the generator is to use random features and graph structure to find vulnerabilities of discriminator and generate node representations with similar but wrong semantic to confuse the discriminator. GA-GGD can improve the model’s semantic information embedding without significantly increasing computational overhead and memory occupancy. We test the effectiveness of the proposed model on commonly used data sets and large-scale datasets, as well as in various downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, and adversarial attacks defence. A wealth of experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed model.

Catalysed by the increasingly abundant spatial big data, Urban Geography seeks new models and research paradigms to explain urban phenomena and address urban issues. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in spatially-explicit geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which integrates spatial studies and AI, primarily focusing on incorporating spatial thinking and concept into deep learning models for urban studies. This paper provides an overview of techniques and applications of spatially-explicit GeoAI in Urban Geography based on 581 papers identified using a systematic review approach. We examined and screened papers in three scopes of Urban Geography (Urban Dynamics, Social Differentiation of Urban Areas, and Social Sensing) and found that although GeoAI is a trending topic in geography and the applications of deep neural network-based methods are proliferating, the development of spatially-explicit GeoAI models is still at their early phase. We identified three challenges of existing models and advised future research direction towards developing multi-scale explainable spatially-explicit GeoAI. This review paper acquaints beginners with the basics of GeoAI and state-of-the-art and serve as an inspiration to attract more research in exploring the potential of spatially-explicit GeoAI in studying the socio-economic dimension of the city and urban life.

AB  - Background:
Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way?
Objective:
The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems.
Method:
We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers.
Results:
From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures.
Conclusions:
From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.

AB  - Biomarker research has investigated the neurobiological basis for individual differences in liability to psychosis. However, few biomarkers for psychosis have been consistently found to be useful. This paper reviews several previous approaches to identify putative biomarkers of liability to psychosis, and then highlights the lessons that we have learned. We argue that limiting our research to clinical patients at the extreme of the psychosis continuum would likely obscure our knowledge as to how a minority of the general population would develop psychosis. Research on putative neurobiological origins of inter-individual differences in personality traits may be useful in mapping the biomarkers of psychosis. To identify biomarkers applicable to the general population, we advocate the transdiagnostic and psychosis continuum approach. We also advocate the use of multivariate analyses and computational modelling to tackle complex multi-modal datasets. More research should be conducted to study intra-individual variations over different ranges of timescale.

These facilitate a more open-ended, multi-dimensional approach that incorporates diverse stakeholders to shape the potential of a collective intelligent operating system — one that best reflects the inherent nature of each unique city and urban condition. The design of smart cities must incorporate and adapt a combination of universal standards and localized policies through global civil society organizations and public-private-people partnerships established to serve the user and citizen as participants of the living city. New methods including co-design, co-creation, citizen participation and user experience (UX) feedback foster inclusive cities. Living labs and innovation hubs provide opportunities and spaces to prototype such initiatives. Transdisciplinary approaches are needed more than ever to expand our scope of inclusion to all life forms, including the rights of animals and nature as stakeholders. By applying a new combination of human and AI-enabled methods such as design thinking, machine learning and generative design, cities can now augment and improve their current state seamlessly, integrating technologies and management as an autopoietic smart city operating system.

AB  - Policy makers dealing with complex systems oftentimes rely on “linear thinking.” This is understandable due to the ease and convenience offered by the simplicity of such conceptualization. Although this line of thinking may help facilitate decision making processes, it is only as defensible as the degree at which the system under consideration behaves linearly. Recent work shows that diverse properties of cities exhibit power-law relationships with population size. Such relationships may invalidate the reliance on linear thinking. Furthermore, in the era of globalization, resources and people move virtually freely through bounds of any confines used to define a system. We incorporate into a simple resource-population model the power-law scaling behavior and the influence of import and immigration, and investigate their effects on sustainable growth of communities. We explore through bifurcation analysis the different scenarios of how an unsustainable system could be sustained. Import can be effective if: the import exceeds a critical level and a critical mass of people populates the system. In contrast, increasing immigration alone can rescue the intrinsically unsustainable system, both directly through people entering the system and indirectly by increasing its harvesting ability, although critical values exist that cause the population to sharply rise or shrink.

AB  - Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide and is often associated with tumor relapse even after chemotherapeutics. This reveals malignancy is a complex process, and high-throughput omics strategies in recent years have contributed significantly in decoding the molecular mechanisms of these complex events in cancer. Further, the omics studies yield a large volume of cancer-specific molecular signatures that promote the discovery of cancer therapy drugs by a method termed signature-based drug repurposing. The drug repurposing method identifies new uses for approved drugs beyond their intended initial therapeutic use, and there are several approaches to it. In this review, we discuss signature-based drug repurposing in cancer, how cancer omics have revolutionized this method of drug discovery, and how one can use the cancer signature data for repurposed drug identification by providing a step-by-step procedural handout. This modern approach maximizes the use of existing therapeutic agents for cancer therapy or combination therapy to overcome chemotherapeutics resistance, making it a pragmatic and efficient alternative to traditional resource-intensive and time-consuming methods.

AB  - Hexokinases (Hks) and mitochondrial complex I (MCI) are involved in the energy metabolism of cells; glycolysis/fermentation and oxidative phosphorylation. Both Hks and MCI are known to play critical roles in either division of metabolic plasticity which enables tumor progression and proliferation in the presence of chemotherapies. Therefore, targeting these enzymes are important in cancer drug resistance. Here, computational models for the prediction of inhibition of Hks were developed based on experimental data and an optimal feature subset that was selected by the Boruta algorithm (a wrapper feature selection algorithm coupled with random forest). Out of the seven models that were explored, a random forest classifier gave the best prediction (GA = 0.84, FNR = 0.12 and AUC = 0.96 for the external dataset). Fragmentation analysis led to the identification of the unique structural scaffolds that characterize hexokinase inhibitors and non-inhibitors. The best Hks inhibition model predicted that 23 molecules out of the 191 dataset of MCI actives (IC50 ≤ 10 µM) that were screened, have more than 60 % probability of exhibiting Hk inhibitory activity. Hence, they are possible dual inhibitors of both targets. Furthermore, the 23 molecules’ core structures are members of the scaffolds that are unique to Hk inhibitors earlier predicted by fragment analysis. The need for dual targeting agents in cancer therapy, particularly in combating cancer drug resistance, highlights the relevance of these findings.

AB  - Predicting personality traits from social networking site profiles can help to assess individual differences in verbal reasoning without using long questionnaires. Inspired by earlier studies, which investigated whether abstract-thinking ability are predictable by social networking sites data, we used supervised machine learning to predict verbal-reasoning ability based on a proposed set of features extracted from virtual community membership. A large sample (N = 3,646) of Russian young adults aged 18–22 years approved access to the data from their social networking accounts and completed an online test on verbal reasoning. We experimented with binary classification machine-learning models for verbal-reasoning prediction. Prediction performance was tested on isolated control subsamples for men and women. The results of prediction on AUC-ROC metrics for control subsamples over 0.7 indicated reasonably good performance on predicting verbal-reasoning level. We also investigated the contribution of virtual community's genres to verbal reasoning level prediction for male and female participants. Theoretical interpretations of results stemming from both Vygotsky's sociocultural theory and behavioural genomics are discussed, including the implication that virtual communities make up a non-shared environment that can cause variance in verbal reasoning. We intend to conduct studies to explore the implications of the results further.

AB  - This paper presents a literature review on methods for enabling real-time analysis in digital twins, which are virtual models of physical systems. The advantages of digital twins are numerous, including cost reduction, risk mitigation, efficiency enhancement, and decision-making support. However, their implementation faces challenges such as the need for real-time data analysis, resource limitations, and data uncertainty. The paper focuses on methods for reducing computational demands, which have not been systematically discussed in the literature. The paper reviews and categorizes methods and tools for accelerating the modeling of physical phenomena and reducing the computational needs of digital twins.

AB  - Background
Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML), an evidence-based debriefing method, promotes thinking like a nurse through reflective learning. Despite widespread adoption of DML, little is known about how well it is implemented. To assess the effectiveness of DML implementation, an evaluative rubric was developed and tested.
Sample
Three debriefers who had been trained to use DML at least 1 year previously, submitted five recorded debriefings each for evaluation.
Methods
Three raters who were experts in DML scored each of the 15 recorded debriefing session using DML Evaluation Scale (DMLES). Observable behaviors were scored with binary options. These raters also assessed the items in the DMLES for content validity.
Results
Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Content Validity Index scores were calculated to determine reliability and validity.
Conclusion
Use of DMLES could support quality improvement, teacher preparation, and faculty development. Future testing is warranted to investigate the relationship between DML implementation and clinical reasoning.

AB  - This paper is focused on those systems that allow students to build their own knowledge by providing them with feedback regarding their actions while performing a problem based learning activity or while making changes to problem statements, so that a higher order thinking skill can be achieved. This feedback is the consequence of an automatic assessment. Particularly, we propose a method that makes use of Language Processor techniques for developing these kinds of systems. This method could be applied in subjects in which problem statements and solutions can be formalized by mean of a formal language and the problems can be solved in an algorithmic way. The method has been used to develop a number of tools that are partially described in this paper. Thus, we show that our approach is applicable in addressing the development of the aforementioned systems. One of these tools (a virtual laboratory for language processing) has been in use for several years in order to support home assignments. The data collected for these years are presented and analyzed in this paper. The results of the analysis confirm that this tool is effective in facilitating the achievement of learning outcomes.

This is due to the fast-changing, new securities that are being formed and enabled through, by and because of the growing role of computation. Geographers have studied cybersecurity as collectively constituted through a complex mixture of technologies, materialities, cultures, knowledges. In so doing, they have probed a range of phenomena crucial to cybersecurity; from technical processes such as encryption, malware infection, and threat detection, to the social arrangements and negotiations between various organizations and states, the implications of surveillance and big data on privacy, and how threats affect various infrastructure that support ways of life across the globe. Nevertheless, geographers do not simply consider cybersecurity as a mode of security imposed “online” or through digital technologies. Rather, in its practice, geographers have demonstrated how cybersecurity involves and invokes socio-political complications around criminality, protection, inequalities, privacy, surveillance, private enterprise, and the role of the state in the life of citizens.

AB  - Building structural models of entire cells has been a long-standing cross-discipline challenge for the research community, as it requires an unprecedented level of integration between multiple sources of biological data and enhanced methods for computational modeling and visualization. Here, we present the first 3D structural models of an entire Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) cell, built using the CellPACK suite of computational modeling tools. Our model recapitulates the data described in recent whole-cell system biology simulations and provides a structural representation for all MG proteins, DNA and RNA molecules, obtained by combining experimental and homology-modeled structures and lattice-based models of the genome. We establish a framework for gathering, curating and evaluating these structures, exposing current weaknesses of modeling methods and the boundaries of MG structural knowledge, and visualization methods to explore functional characteristics of the genome and proteome. We compare two approaches for data gathering, a manually-curated workflow and an automated workflow that uses homologous structures, both of which are appropriate for the analysis of mesoscale properties such as crowding and volume occupancy. Analysis of model quality provides estimates of the regularization that will be required when these models are used as starting points for atomic molecular dynamics simulations.

AB  - The concept of complexity has been widely discussed in the last forty years, with a lot of thinking contributions coming from all areas of the human knowledge, including Philosophy, Linguistics, History, Biology, Physics, Chemistry and many others, with mathematicians trying to give a rigorous view of it. In this sense, thermodynamics meets information theory and, by using the entropy definition, López-Ruiz, Mancini and Calbet proposed a definition for complexity that is referred as LMC measure. Shiner, Davison and Landsberg, by slightly changing the LMC definition, proposed the SDL measure and the both, LMC and SDL, are satisfactory to measure complexity for a lot of problems. Here, SDL and LMC measures are applied to the case of a binomial probability distribution, trying to clarify how the length of the data set implies complexity and how the success probability of the repeated trials determines how complex the whole set is.

Dosimeters were calibrated in a reference clinical linear acccelerator beam in a water tank at a reference facility at the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (CEA LIST/LNE LNHB, Saclay. Radiation qualities of 6, 12 and 20 MV were used with standard calibration conditions described in IAEA TRS 398 and non-standard conditions. Profile and depth dose ion chamber measurements were also made to provide reference values. Measurements were made in a water tank into which pipes could be inserted which held dosimeters in pre-determined and reproducible positions. The water tank was built to enable investigation of doses up to 60 cm from the beam axis. A first set of experiments was carried out with the beam passing through the tank. From this first experiment, penumbra and out-of-field dose profiles including water and collimator scatter and leakage were found over three orders of magnitude. Two further sets of experiments using the same experimental arrangement with the beam outside the tank, to avoid water scatter, were designed to measure collimator scatter and leakage by closing the jaws of the collimator. Depending on the energy, typical leakage and collimator scatter represents 10–40% and 30–50% of the total out-of-field doses respectively. It was concluded that all dosimeters can be used for out-of-field photon dosimetry. All show good uniformity, good reproducibility, and can be used down to low doses expected at distances remote from the subsequent radiotherapy target volume.

AB  - Consciousness is a puzzling, state-dependent property of certain types of complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected systems. The best example is a healthy and attentive human brain. If the brain is anesthetized, consciousness ceases. Small lesions in the midbrain and thalamus of patients can lead to a complete loss of consciousness, while destruction of circumscribed parts of the cerebral cortex of patients can eliminate very specific aspects of consciousness, such as the ability to be aware of motion or to recognize objects (e.g., faces), without a concomitant loss of consciousness in general. Given the similarity in brain structure and behavior, biologists commonly assume that at least some animals, in particular nonhuman primates, share certain aspects of consciousness with humans. Brain scientists are exploiting a number of empirical approaches that shed light on the neural basis of consciousness. At present, it is not known to what extent artificial systems, such as computers, robots, or the World Wide Web as a whole, are or can become ‘conscious.’ What is needed is a theory of consciousness that explains in quantitative terms what types of systems, with what architecture, can possess conscious states.

The Index of Connectivity (IC) has become a widely used tool, offering a practical way to assess sediment connectivity from hillslopes to downstream channels. We present a novel implementation of IC in R environment to expand the audience of users and encourage alternative applications of the index. The R_IC is an open-source and freely available tool composed by three codes. Standard R_IC runs the IC and it represents the core of the other variants. Custom R_IC offers a more flexible script, allowing the computation of alternative weighting factors and the possibility of running a further profile IC analysis. Batch R_IC performs batch processing of the index. For each code variant, a geomorphological application is presented to illustrate how the R_IC could be used in watershed management and practical issues related to sediment dynamics.

AB  - Various clinical guidelines recommend cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to treat psychosis without reference to patients’ thought disorder. However, there is a risk that disorganized thinking hampers CBT. We tested the prediction that thought disorder would interfere with the effectiveness of CBT for hallucinations and delusions, compared to treatment as usual and supportive counselling, in secondary data from two large, single blind randomised controlled trials. We fitted latent growth curve models separately for the development of frequency and distress of symptoms. CBT was significantly more successful than counselling in reducing delusional frequency in the short term and hallucinatory distress at any point, even in those with relatively high thought disorder. We found little evidence that clinicians should restrict CBT in this subgroup of patients. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the importance of effective initial treatment of thought disorder in maximising the benefit of CBT for psychosis, particularly for reducing distress from hallucinations.

The pressing challenge of decarbonization encompasses a vast combinatorial space of interlinked technologies, thus necessitating an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted molecular modeling and data analytics. Our backcasting analysis proposes a future rich in efficient decarbonization technologies, such as sustainable fuels for aviation and shipping, as well as carbon capture and utilization. We then retrace the path to this proposed future with the guidance of two constraints: the maximization of scientists’ creative capacities and the evolution of a world-centric AI. Our exploration leads us to the concept of a “CreatorSpace,” a distributed digital system resembling existing hackerspaces and makerspaces known for accelerating the prototyping of new technologies worldwide. The CreatorSpace serves as a virtual, semantic platform where chemists, engineers, and materials scientists can freely collaborate, integrating chemical knowledge with cross-scale, cross-technology tools, and operations. This streamlined molecular-to-process-design pathway facilitates a diverse array of solutions for decarbonization and other sustainability technologies.

AB  - Design can be regarded as a seeing–moving–seeing process, where designers repeatedly see and generate ideas that are based on what they have done. The crucial point of design thinking is how designers recognize ambiguous shapes from sketches and then transfer them into different shapes. This study attempts to conduct cognitive experiments to elucidate the sketching process and to simulate two types of sketching behavior used by neural network systems. When exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior, designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. Simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements, as human designers do. When demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior, designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. Another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the TSL and produce different idea sketches from the same shape.

We find that former professional football players have superior forecasting ability when compared to laypeople. The results give partial support to the view that a crowd forecast offers the greatest precision. Pundits generate a positive return while both the crowd and laypeople generate losses. As the prediction of multiple score outcomes represents a computationally difficult task, both groups display forecasting biases including a preference toward specific score forecasts. The results are relevant for those concerned with gambling behaviour if the forecasting strategies adopted here generalise to match betting markets.

However, the relationship between these communities has the prospect of being weakened by application of oversimplistic AI methods that, if they fail to deliver, will reinforce unproductive prejudices. We review what can be learned from our history of integrating QSAR and structure-based methods into drug discovery. Now with synthesis and testing available as contract services, the environment for computational innovation has changed and we consider the impact this may have on the relationships in our disciplines. We discuss the current state of interdisciplinary communication and suggest approaches to bring the subdisciplines together in order to improve computational medicinal chemistry and, most importantly, deliver better medicines to the clinic faster.

AB  - Data science is focused on extracting meaningful value from complex datasets. Exposome-related data are certainly complex with information coming from a myriad of sources. The huge amounts of data must be organized in some manner that allows appropriate interpretations and associations to be drawn. It is unlikely that unsupervised approaches will allow for causal associations to be made, but with proper study design and appropriate statistical and computational models, it should be possible to derive meaningful connections between complex exposures and specific health outcomes. The complex types of data will undoubtedly require sophistical mathematical approaches, including bioinformatics, computational, machine learning, and systems biology-based techniques. This chapter reviews some of the possible strategies that can be used to keep track of the diverse and massive datasets that will result from exposome research.

AB  - The early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) through medical image analysis is a pivotal concern in healthcare, with the potential to significantly reduce mortality rates. Current Domain Adaptation (DA) methods strive to mitigate the discrepancies between different imaging modalities that are critical in identifying CRC, yet they often fall short in addressing the complexity of cancer's presentation within these images. These conventional techniques typically overlook the intricate geometrical structures and the local variations within the data, leading to suboptimal diagnostic performance. This study introduces an innovative application of the Discriminative Manifold Distribution Alignment (DMDA) method, which is specifically engineered to enhance the medical image diagnosis of colorectal cancer. DMDA transcends traditional DA approaches by focusing on both local and global distribution alignments and by intricately learning the intrinsic geometrical characteristics present in manifold space. This is achieved without depending on the potentially misleading pseudo-labels, a common pitfall in existing methodologies. Our implementation of DMDA on three distinct datasets, involving several unique DA tasks, has consistently demonstrated superior classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The method adeptly captures the complex morphological and textural nuances of CRC lesions, leading to a significant leap in domain adaptation technology. DMDA's ability to reconcile global and local distributional disparities, coupled with its manifold-based geometrical structure learning, signals a paradigm shift in medical imaging analysis. The results obtained are not only promising in terms of advancing domain adaptation theory but also in their practical implications, offering the prospect of substantially improved diagnostic accuracy and faster clinical workflows. This heralds a transformative approach in personalized oncology care, aligning with the pressing need for early and accurate CRC detection.

AB  - Three different approaches show that, contrary to a longstanding conviction older than 160 years, the advance of Mercury’s perihelion can be achieved in Newtonian gravity with a very high precision by correctly analyzing the situation without neglecting Mercury’s mass. General relativity remains more precise than Newtonian physics, but Newtonian framework is more powerful than researchers and astronomers were thinking till now, at least for the case of Mercury. The Newtonian formula of the advance of planets’ perihelion breaks down for the other planets. The predicted Newtonian result is indeed too large for Venus and Earth. Therefore, it is also shown that corrections due to gravitational and rotational time dilation, in an intermediate framework which analyzes gravity between Newton and Einstein, solve the problem. By adding such corrections, a result consistent with the one of general relativity is indeed obtained. Thus, the most important results of this paper are two: (i) It is not correct that Newtonian theory cannot predict the anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of planets’ orbit. The real problem is instead that a pure Newtonian prediction is too large. (ii) Perihelion’s precession can be achieved with the same precision of general relativity by extending Newtonian gravity through the inclusion of gravitational and rotational time dilation effects. This second result is in agreement with a couple of recent and interesting papers of Hansen, Hartong and Obers. Differently from such papers, in the present work the importance of rotational time dilation is also highlighted. Finally, it is important to stress that a better understanding of gravitational effects in an intermediate framework between Newtonian theory and general relativity, which is one of the goals of this paper, could, in principle, be crucial for a subsequent better understanding of the famous Dark Matter and Dark Energy problems.

AB  - As a crucial step in understanding human intelligence, Brain Informatics (BI) focuses on thinking centric investigations of human cognitive functions with respect to multiple activated brain areas and neurobiological processes for a given task. Although it has been recognized that systematic human brain data analysis is an important issue of BI methodology, the existing expert-driven multi-aspect data analysis excessively depends on individual capabilities and cannot be widely adopted in BI community. In this paper, we propose a Data-Brain driven approach for systematic brain data analysis, which is implemented by using the Data-Brain, Data-Brain based BI provenances and Global Learning Scheme for BI. Furthermore, a human numerical inductive reasoning centric investigation is described to demonstrate significance and usefulness of the proposed approach. Such a Data-Brain driven approach reduces the dependency on individual capabilities and provides a practical way for realizing the systematic human brain data analysis of BI methodology.

To show the applicability of the proposed methodology, a project for the industrial production of ethanol from sugar cane was considered. Students enrolled in Process Design (9th semester) and Computer-Assisted Technical Design (5th semester), courses included in the engineering programs offered by the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yachay Tech University (Ecuador), jointly developed it. The details of the project were presented to the students of the Introduction to Engineering course (3rd semester) to boost their interest in the engineering as applied science. The activities carried out in each of the courses are described in detail together with a description of how the learning outcomes were achieved thanks to the implementation of a multi-level training strategy. Teamwork and collaborative-integrated learning are the elements highlighted by the students who participated in the project. Some of the innovative aspects of the proposed methodology include professional training and multi-level learning, the development of logical thinking typical of engineers, the knowledge handover associated with the professional activities of process engineers engaged with real-world projects. Additionally, this methodology prizes the industrial experience that professors at the undergraduate level may have by allowing them to contribute with an engineering vision to the training of young people in engineering projects. This study was inspired by the principle of Constructive Alignment and by goal # 4 (quality education) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

AB  - Abstract
As a type of economical energy recovery device, pump as turbine (PAT) is generally used in micro-hydropower plants and energy recovery. To study the influence of the splitter blade on a special impeller used in PAT, impellers without and with splitter blades are designed in this paper. The influences of splitter blade on the energy loss, external characteristics and internal flow field distribution of a PAT were simulated via a verified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The consequences present that the shaft power, efficiency, and head corresponding to the BEP of the PAT with splitter blades are 16.4%, 1.3%, and 8.8% better than those of the PAT without splitter blades. The total entropy production of the PAT without splitter blade is higher than that of the PAT with splitter blades at the same flow rate. Adding splitter blade increased the number of effective blades, made the fluid flow more evenly along the impeller flow passage, and reduced the flow separation inside the impeller. This paper displays that adding splitter blades not only obviously increases hydraulic performance under large flow conditions but also significantly widens the high-efficiency range of PATs.

The second program suggests a new approach and computational architecture for the cognitively-inspired anchoring of an agent’s learning, knowledge formation, and higher reasoning abilities in real-world interactions through a closed neural–symbolic acting/sensing–processing–reasoning cycle, potentially providing new foundations for future agent architectures, multi-agent systems, robotics, and cognitive systems and facilitating a deeper understanding of the development and interaction in human-technological settings.

AB  - Infection with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy, is still endemic in numerous parts of the world including the southwestern United States. The broad variation of symptoms in the leprosy disease spectrum range from the milder tuberculoid leprosy (paucibacillary) to the more severe and disfiguring lepromatous leprosy (multibacillary). The established thinking in the health community is that host response, rather than M. leprae strain variation, is the reason for the range of disease severity. More recent discoveries suggest that macrophage polarization also plays a significant role in the spectrum of leprosy disease but to what degree it contributes is not fully established. In this study, we aimed to analyze if different strains of M. leprae elicit different transcription responses in human macrophages, and to examine the role of macrophage polarization in these responses. Genomic DNA from three different strains of M. leprae DNA (Strains NHDP, Br4923, and Thai-53) were used to stimulate human macrophages under three polarization conditions (M1, M1-activated, and M2). Transcriptome analysis revealed a large number of differentially expressed (DE) genes upon stimulation with DNA from M. leprae strain Thai-53 compared to strains NHDP and Br4923, independent of the macrophage polarization condition. We also found that macrophage polarization affects the responses to M. leprae DNA, with up-regulation of numerous interferon stimulated genes. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of macrophage polarization in the recognition of M. leprae DNA, with the potential to improve leprosy treatment strategies.

AB  - Bayesian inference has long been recognized as useful for fisheries stock assessments but it is less common than maximum likelihood approaches due to long run times and a lack of good practices. Recent computational advances leave developing good practices and user-friendly interfaces as the most important hurdles to wider use of this powerful statistical paradigm. Here, I argue that the modern Bayesian workflow proposed by Gelman et al. (2020) should form the basis for proposed good practices in fisheries sciences. Their workflow is a conceptual roadmap for iterative model building which includes the philosophical role of priors and how to apply statistical tools to construct them, how to validate and compare models, and how to overcome computational problems. Adapted for stock assessment, this leads to the following good practices for analysts. Diagnostics from multiple no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) chains (the recommended MCMC algorithm) should pass and be reported, specifically that the potential scale reduction Rˆ is <1.01 and the effective sample size is >400 for all parameters, and there are no NUTS divergences. When direct a priori information is unavailable on parameters, use prior predictive checking to build, assess, and adjust priors to enforce desired constraints on complexity, or to conform to a priori expectations or physical/biological limitations on derived quantities. Use posterior predictive checks to validate models by confirming simulated data and summaries (e.g., variance of compositional data) are similar to the observed counterparts. Process error variances can be estimated jointly with random effects and other parameters when desired, and should be for important model components. An approximate cross-validation technique called PSIS-LOO is the most practical tool for model selection, but can also provide important insights into model deficiencies. I also recommended that model developers build and parameterize models to have minimal parameter correlations and marginal variances close to one, have options for diverse (multivariate) priors, do predictive modeling, and ensure that the tools comprising a workflow are accessible and straightforward for routine use. I review, adapt, and illustrate a Bayesian workflow on AD Model Builder and Stock Synthesis models, but these good practices apply to models from any software platform, including Template Model Builder and Stan. Finally, I argue that the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms complement each other, with both helping analysts better understand different aspects of their models and data. Wider adoption of Bayesian methods using the good practices proposed here would therefore lead to improved scientific advice used to manage fisheries.

We conclude the review by analyzing the frequency of modeling approaches in microbiology over time. We find that while such methods are increasing in popularity, they are still probably heavily under-utilized for optimal progress on complex biological questions.

AB  - Innovation in business-to-business (B2B) contexts deals with highly dynamic, complex, and heterogeneous constellations of stakeholders with a diversity of goals, motives, and capabilities that further challenge successful management of B2B innovation processes and outcomes. Complex challenges, such as sustainability and digitization trends, push these B2B firms to embrace new innovation methods that help them manage disruptive change. Service design thinking has emerged as an innovation management practice emphasizing a human-centered innovation process of user interactions, creativity, and learning mindsets. In this article, we aim to evaluate the challenges and develop a research agenda on how service design can effectively enable stakeholders' engagement during the B2B innovation process. We argue that to advance service design opportunities for stakeholder engagement, we need to address the unique complexities and challenges of stakeholder engagement during innovation from a systemic and dynamic process perspective. From a systemic perspective, we zoom in on the building blocks of stakeholder engagement and address multi-level stakeholder engagement platforms (i.e., innovation networks). From a dynamic process perspective, we treat stakeholder engagement as an emerging process and zoom in on the temporal and relational connections and hybrid orchestration to allow for both structural and emerging stakeholder engagement during innovation. We develop a stakeholder engagement journey in which we integrate service and innovation stages and propose how service design activities can support and facilitate the aforementioned challenges and complexities. Finally, we identify concrete research questions and, accordingly, develop a research agenda for future research on stakeholder engagement in B2B innovation trajectories.

AB  - Descriptions of problem-solution “co-evolution” either explicitly or implicitly draw an analogy between processes of design and processes of biological evolution. Analogies of this kind are common in research because of their potential to assist in explanation and discovery. However, reviewing the design literature reveals that the discussion of design co-evolution has become disconnected from the biological analogy on which it is founded, and from which other disciplines draw. Here, I explore the function of the co-evolution analogy, provide an illustrative example from biology, and explore the varieties of co-evolution to which design might be compared. By doing so, I propose two possible directions for expanding the design co-evolution concept: (i) examining what co-evolves in addition to, or instead of, problems and solutions, and (ii) examining the different levels at which co-evolution occurs. Both of these proposals are illustrated with a variant of the design co-evolution diagram.

AB  - Objective
To describe school cafeteria interventions in terms of a behavioral economics scheme and to assess which system is more likely to be effective in improving food selection or consumption.
Study design
With this systematic review, we categorize cafeteria interventions using the behavioral economics theory of Kahneman into system 1 (fast and intuitive thinking) and system 2 (slow and cognitively demanding) or mixed (having elements of system 1 and system 2). Pertinent studies were identified from review of the literature of interventions performed in school and cafeteria settings in children grades K-12 within the past 5 years (2012-2017) at time of search.
Results
In all, 48 of 978 studies met inclusion criteria. By defining success as a 30% improvement in a desired outcome or statistically significant reduction in body mass index, 89% of system 1, 67% of mixed (had both system 1 and 2 elements), and only 33% of system 2 interventions were successful.
Conclusions
This review found successful system 1 type school cafeteria interventions to be more common than system 2 type interventions and system 2 type interventions are less effective than system 1.

AB  - Nuclear safety has always been at the heart of the concerns of nuclear power plant operators and developers, as well as of various nuclear research organizations and regulatory authorities. Over the last decades, all these nuclear actors have developed and integrated a large number of calculation codes and other tools into their safety work. From the system approach to the local understanding of a phenomenon on a given component, from neutronics to operation optimization for long-term operation, these methods and codes have been constantly evolving since their appearance, in order to be able to integrate new plant designs and components, to improve the results of modeling physical phenomena or quantify and thus reduce the uncertainties on these results. Currently, several H2020 Euratom projects are working on the improvement of these codes and methods. This article will focus on three of these projects: CAMIVVER (Codes And Methods Improvements for VVER comprehensive safety assessment), APAL (Advanced PTS Analysis for LTO), and sCO2-4-NPP (innovative SCO2-based heat removal technology for an increased level of safety of Nuclear Power Plants) in order to illustrate our thinking on the improvement of calculation frameworks. First, we will present the work and the approach adopted with regard to the different calculation codes and methods used in each of these three projects. We will then conclude with an overall analysis of these three approaches, highlighting the difficulties and successes of these three projects, and identifying areas of work for the general improvement of the calculation codes.

AB  - I take a communicative pragmatist and realist approach to futures studies. This implies a sensitivity to understanding what the audience can absorb and using futures methods effectively to create spaces for new futures. While Wilber's work affords us with new insights to engage with methodology, is not the only path. Indeed, it is intellectual bigotry to demand that everyone master the tools one personally deems most appropriate. Critical conversations about futures must remain open, where post-modernist and integral thinking widen our horizons, they are welcomed, where they straitjacket our thoughts, they are not.

AB  - Recent models of cognition suggest that the brain may implement predictive processing, in which top-down expectations constrain incoming sensory data. In this perspective, expectations are updated (error minimization) only if sensory data sufficiently deviate from these expectations (prediction error). Although originally applied to perception, predictive processing is thought to generally characterize cognitive architecture, including the social cognitive processes involved in ideological thinking. Scaling up these simple computational principles to the social sphere outlines a path by which group members may adopt shared ideologies and beliefs to predict behavior and cooperate with each other. Because ideological judgments are of specific interest to others in our political groups, we may increasingly regulate each other’s thinking, sharing the process of error minimization. In this paper, we outline how this process of shared error minimization may lead to shared ideologies and beliefs that allow group members to predict and cooperate with each other, and how, as a consequence, political polarization and extremism may result.

AB  - Introduction
Schizophrenia is a clinical construct comprising manifold phenotypes underlying heterogeneous biological underpinnings. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) represents the standard tool in the clinical characterization of patients affected by schizophrenia, allowing to detect different clinical profiles within the disorder. Frontal lobes are a key area of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. We investigated whether different clinical profiles in acute schizophrenia show differences in frontal lobes dysfunction or not.
Methods
We defined PANSS-derived principal components in a sample of 516 acute patients. These components were used as clustering variables in a finite-mixture model. Frontal lobe impairment, measured with the frontal assessment battery (FAB) score, was adjusted for disease duration and compared across the clinical clusters with ANCOVA. A supervised-learning approach was then implemented to reveal most informative PANSS items.
Results
A three-cluster solution emerged: a first profile with high-moderate expression for the positive and excitability/hostility component; a second profile scoring high on depression/anxiety and low on other components; a third profile, comprising the majority of the study population (74%), with a heavy affection on the negative-disorganization dimensions. After controlling for disease duration, frontal lobe impairment significantly differed across the aforementioned clusters, with the third cluster being the most affected. Two PANSS items presented the highest predictive value for FAB total score.
Conclusions
Among negative and disorganization symptoms, “difficulty in abstract thinking” and “lack of spontaneity/flow in conversation” are specifically mapped to higher levels of frontal lobes dysfunction, hinting at similar features with other neurological disorders involving frontal lobes.

AB  - COVID-19 has caused great challenges to the energy industry. Potential new practices and social forms being facilitated by the pandemics are having impacts on energy demand and consumption. Spatial and temporal heterogeneities of impacts appear gradually due to the dynamics of pandemics and mitigation measures. This paper overviews the impacts and challenges of COVID-19 pandemics on energy demand and consumption and highlights energy-related lessons and emerging opportunities. The discussion on energy-related issues is divided into four main sections: emergency situation and its impacts, environmental impacts and stabilising energy demand, recovering energy demand, and lessons and emerging opportunities. The changes in energy requirements are compared and analysed from multiple perspectives according to available data and information. In general, although the overall energy demand declines, the spatial and temporal variations are complicated. The energy intensity has presented apparent changes, the extra energy for COVID-19 fighting is non-negligible for stabilising energy demand, and the energy recovery in different regions presents significant differences. A crucial issue has been to allocate and find energy-related emerging opportunities for the post pandemics. This study could offer a direction in opening new avenues for increasing energy efficiency and promoting energy saving.

AB  - History illustrates that economic crises and other sociopolitical threats often lead to a rise of polarization and radicalism, whereby people become more susceptible to intolerant political messages, including propaganda and ideological rhetoric. Political science, sociology, economics, and psychology have explored many dimensions of this phenomenon, yet a critical piece of the puzzle is still missing: what cognitive and neural mechanisms in the brain mediate between these threats and responsiveness to political messages? To answer this question, here, we present a theory that combines cognitive neuroscience theories, namely stress-induced memory shift and competitive cognitive processes, with political science. Our Threat-based Neural Switch Theory posits that the processing of political information, similarly to other information processing, is shaped by the competitive interaction between goal-directed and habitual processes. Threats, including resource overload or scarcity, can shift neural networks toward receptiveness to oversimplified political messages. This theory sets out a research program aimed at discovering the cognitive and neural underpinning of how situational factors alter brain functions and modify political information processing.

AB  - In this work, a cooperative Gray wolf Optimizer with adaptive differential Evolution (GOE) is proposed for the multimodal controller parameters optimization of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) based on maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategies. Moreover, the optimization process of the GOE is accelerated by a deep fully connected model (DFCM). The GOE contains a cooperative gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and adaptive differential evolution (ADE). The cooperative GWO contains alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolves to explore and exploit optimization problems and achieves optimization tasks wider and deeper than GWO. The ADE cooperates with the cooperative GWO to solve global optimization over continuous spaces. The simulation results on seven uni-model benchmark functions show that the GOE accelerated by DFCM obtains acceptable fitness values with 39.99% lesser computation time than the symmetry adapted stochastic search (SASS) algorithm and 80.72% lesser computation time than the Lévy flights-success-history based adaptive differential evolution with constraint handling technique (COLSHADE) algorithm, which are the winners of the CEC2020 Competition on Real-World Single Objective Constrained Optimization. Furthermore, the simulation results on DFIG with MPPT strategies in three real-world cases verify that the GOE accelerated by DFCM can effectively obtain global optimization solutions for non-smooth problems with 99.51% lesser average computation time than the SASS algorithm, 99.63% less than the COLSHADE algorithm, and 89.52% less than other methods. In addition, the accelerated GOE algorithm by DFCM has the feature of faster convergence.

AB  - The accessibility of advanced Artificial Intelligence-based tools, like ChatGPT, has made Large Language Models (LLMs) readily available to students. These LLMs can generate original written content to assist students in their academic assessments. With the rapid adoption of LLMs, exemplified by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT, there is a growing need to explore their application in education. Few studies examine students' use of LLMs as learning tools. This paper focuses on the application of ChatGPT in engineering higher education through an in-depth case study. It investigates whether engineering students can generate high-quality university essays with LLMs assistance, whether existing LLMs identification systems can detect essays produced with LLMs, and how students perceive the usefulness and acceptance of LLMs in learning. The research adopts a deductive/inductive approach, combining conceptualization and empirical evidence analysis. The study involves mechanical and management engineering students, who compose essays using LLMs. The essay assessment showed good results, but some recommendations emerged for teachers and students. Thirteen LLMs detectors were tested without achieving satisfactory results, suggesting to avoid LLMs ban. In addition, students were administered a questionnaire based on constructs and items that follow the technology acceptance models available in the literature. The results contribute to qualitative evidence by highlighting possible future research and educational practices.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the levels of IgG against neurotransmitter receptors are increased in patients with schizophrenia. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies of schizophrenia confirmed that 108 loci harbouring over 300 genes were associated with schizophrenia. Although the functional implications of genetic variants are unclear, theoretical functional alterations of these genes could be replicated by the presence of autoantibodies. This study examined the levels of plasma IgG antibodies against four neurotransmitter receptors, CHRM4, GRM3, CHRNA4 and CHRNA5, using an in-house ELISA in 247 patients with schizophrenia and 344 non-psychiatric controls. Four peptides were designed based on in silico analysis with computational prediction of HLA-DRB1 restricted and B-cell epitopes. The relationship between plasma IgG levels and psychiatric symptoms, as defined by the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness and Affective Illness (OPCRIT), were examined. The results showed that the levels of plasma IgG against peptides derived from CHRM4 and CHRNA4 were significantly increased in patients with schizophrenia compared with control subjects, but there was no significant association of plasma IgG levels with any symptom domain or any specific symptoms. These preliminary results suggest that CHRM4 and CHRNA4 may be novel targets for autoantibody responses in schizophrenia, although the pathogenic relationship between increased serum autoantibody levels and schizophrenia symptoms remains unclear.

AB  - Code biology uses protein synthesis to pursue how living systems fabricate themselves. Weight falls on intermediary systems or adaptors that enable translated DNA to function within a cellular apparatus. Specifically, code intermediaries bridge between independent worlds (e.g. those of RNAs and proteins) to grant functional lee-way to the resulting products. Using this Organic Code (OC) model, the paper draws parallels with how people use artificial codes. As illustrated by Tetris and Morse, human players/signallers manage code functionality by using bodies as (or like) adaptors. They act as coding intermediaries who use lee-way alongside “a small set of arbitrary rules selected from a potentially unlimited number in order to ensure a specific correspondence between two independent worlds” (Barbieri, 2015). As with deep learning, networked bodily systems mesh inputs from a coded past with current inputs. Received models reduce ‘use’ of codes to a run-time or program like process. They overlook how molecular memory is extended by living apparatuses that link codes with functioning adaptors. In applying the OC model to humans, the paper connects Turing’s (1937) view of thinking to Wilson’s (2004) appeal to wide cognition. The approach opens up a new view of Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994) seminal studies on Tetris. As players use an interface that actualizes a code or program, their goal-directed (i.e. ‘pragmatic’) actions co-occur with adaptor-like ‘filling in’ (i.e. ‘epistemic’ moves). In terms of the OC model, flexible functions derive from, not actions, but epistemic dynamics that arise in the human-interface-computer system. Second, I pursue how a Morse radio operator uses dibs and dabs that enable the workings of an artificial code. While using knowledge (‘the rules’) to resemiotize by tapping on a transmission key, bodily dynamics are controlled by adaptor-like resources. Finally, turning to language, I sketch how the model applies to writing and reading. Like Morse operators, writers resemiotize a code-like domain of alphabets, spelling-systems etc. by acting as (or like) bodily adaptors. Further, in attending to a text-interface (symbolizations), a reader relies on filling-in that is (or feels) epistemic. Given that humans enact or mimic adaptor functions, it is likely that the OC model also applies to multi-modal language.

AB  - Here, we introduce a fully local index named “sensitivity” for each neuron to control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also propose a learning method to adjust it named “sensitivity adjustment learning (SAL)”. The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square) sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the weight matrix before learning, SAL’s continuous nonlinear learning nature prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant improvement in learning performance.

ABSTRACT
Physical distancing and inaccessibility to laboratory facilities created an opportunity to transition undergraduate research experiences to remote, digital platforms, adding another level of pedagogy to their training. Basic bioinformatics skills together with critical analysis of scientific literature are essential for addressing research questions in modern biology. The work presented here describes a fully online, collaborative research experience created to allow undergraduate students to learn those skills. The research experience was focused on the development and implementation of the Organonitrogen Biodegradation Database (ONDB, z.umn.edu/ondb). The ONDB was developed to catalog information about the cost, chemical properties, and biodegradation potential of commonly used organonitrogen compounds. A cross-institutional team of undergraduate researchers worked in collaboration with two faculty members and a postdoctoral fellow to develop the database. Students carried out extensive online literature searches and used a biodegradation prediction website to research and represent the microbial catabolism of different organonitrogen compounds. Participants employed computational tools such as R, Shiny, and flexdashboard to construct the database pages and interactive web interface for the ONDB. Worksheets and forms were created to encourage other students and researchers to gather information about organonitrogen compounds and expand the database. Student progress was evaluated through biweekly project meetings, presentations, and a final reflection. The ONDB undergraduate research experience provided a platform for students to learn bioinformatics skills while simultaneously developing a teaching and research tool for others.

AB  - Summary
Social interactions routinely lead to neural activity in a “social brain network” comprising, among other regions, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). But what is the function of these areas? Are they specialized for behavior in social contexts or do they implement computations required for dealing with any reactive process, even non-living entities? Here, we use fMRI and a game paradigm separating the need for these two aspects of cognition. We find that most social-brain areas respond to both social and non-social reactivity rather than just to human opponents. However, the TPJ shows a dissociation from the dmPFC: its activity and connectivity primarily reflect context-dependent outcome processing and reactivity detection, while dmPFC engagement is linked to implementation of a behavioral strategy. Our results characterize an overarching computational property of the social brain but also suggest specialized roles for subregions of this network.

AB  - A contentious debate in political psychology has centred on the role of cognitive rigidity in shaping individuals’ political ideologies and worldviews. Early theories in the 1950s posited that strict ideological doctrines may tend to attract individuals with dispositions towards mental rigidity. This question has persisted: Does psychological rigidity foster a tendency towards ideological extremism? This review evaluates the empirical landscape with respect to the rigidity-of-the-extreme and the rigidity-of-the-right hypotheses and offers conceptual and methodological recommendations for future research avenues. The evidence suggests that cognitive rigidity is linked to ideological extremism, partisanship, and dogmatism across political and non-political ideologies. Advances in the measurement of ideological extremity and cognitive rigidity will facilitate further elucidation regarding how exactly the two hypotheses may be reconciled and why they have been historically placed in a potentially false competition. This synthesis suggests that a scientifically rigorous understanding of the cognitive roots of ideological thinking may be essential for developing effective antidotes to intolerance and intergroup hostility.

AB  - Summary
From maps sketched in sand to supercomputing software, humans ubiquitously enhance cognitive performance by creating and using artifacts that bear mental load [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This extension of information processing into the environment has taken center stage in debates about the nature of cognition in humans and other animals [6, 7, 8, 9]. How does the human mind acquire such strategies? In two experiments, we investigated the developmental origins of cognitive offloading in 150 children aged between 4 and 11 years. We created a memory task in which children were required to recall the location of hidden targets. In one experiment, participants were provided with a pre-specified cognitive offloading opportunity: an option to mark the target locations with tokens during the hiding period. Even 4-year-old children quickly adopted this external strategy and, in line with a metacognitive account, children across ages offloaded more often when the task was more difficult. In a second experiment, we provided children with the means to devise their own cognitive offloading strategy. Very few younger children spontaneously devised a solution, but by ages 10 and 11, nearly all did so. In a follow-up test phase, a simple prompt greatly increased the rate at which the younger children devised an offloading strategy. These findings suggest that sensitivity to the difficulties of thinking arises early in development and improves throughout the early school years, with children learning to modify the world around them to compensate for their cognitive limits.

AB  - Serious adverse health effects have been reported with the use of vaping products, including neurologic disorders and e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Vitamin E acetate, likely added as a diluent to cannabis-containing products, was linked to EVALI. Literature searches were performed on vitamin E and vitamin E acetate-associated neurotoxicity. Blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration potential of vitamin E and vitamin E acetate were evaluated using cheminformatic techniques. Review of the literature showed that the neurotoxic potential of inhalation exposures to these compounds in humans is unknown. Physico-chemical properties demonstrate these compounds are lipophilic, and molecular weights indicate vitamin E and vitamin E acetate have the potential for BBB permeability. Computational models also predict both compounds may cross the BBB via passive diffusion. Based on literature search, no experimental nonclinical studies and clinical information on the neurotoxic potential of vitamin E via inhalation. Neurotoxic effects from pyrolysis by-product, phenyl acetate, structurally analogous to vitamin E acetate, suggests vitamin E acetate has potential for central nervous system (CNS) impairment. Cheminformatic model predictions provide a theoretical basis for potential CNS permeability of these inhaled dietary ingredients suggesting prioritization to evaluate for potential hazard to the CNS.

AB  - This paper argues that evolutionary thinking and modeling can contribute to the emerging research on sustainability transitions and their management. Evolutionary theory provides a range of concepts and mechanisms that are useful in making existing theorizing about transitions more precise and complete. In particular, we will discuss how the multi-level, multi-phase, co-evolutionary, and social learning dynamics underlying transitions can be addressed in evolutionary models. In addition, evolutionary theorizing offers suggestions for extending current theoretical frameworks of transitions. Group selection provides a good example. We review the small set of formal evolutionary models of sustainability transitions, and show that existing formal evolutionary models of technological, social and institutional change can provide useful inputs to transition research and management.

These future perspectives are organized in nine sections: the educational implications of literacy, information literacy, digital literacy, literacy education, multiliteracies and holistic perspectives, media literacy, futures literacy, algorithmic literacy and artificial intelligence implications, and other literacies. The purpose of this entry is to offer a brief overview and commentary on the types of literacies that we need to be aware of and competent in for the near future. As these future trends are derived from the specialized literature, they include some already occurring considerations. However, they might become more salient topics in the upcoming years, and they might entail many different implications for the future of LIS professionals, libraries, and even for education in general.

AB  - In recent years, dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has seen the synthesis of increasingly complex cyclooligomers, polymers, and diverse compound libraries. The reversible formation of covalent bonds characteristic of DCC reactions favors thermodynamic product distributions for simple unitopic reactions; however, kinetic effects are increasingly influential in reactions of multitopic precursors. In this review, we explore the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic considerations when planning a DCC synthesis. Computational models, typically based on reaction thermodynamics, have aided in predicting DCC reaction outcomes with moderate success. A clear direction for the field is to develop more robust computational tools informed by thermodynamic and kinetic driving forces that can predict product distributions in DCC reactions.

A simulation is a mathematical model that describes or creates computationally a system process. Simulations are our best cognitive representation of complex reality, that is, our deepest conception of what reality is. In this paper we defend that a simulation is equivalent epistemologically and ontologically with all other types of cognitive models of elements of reality. Therefore, simulations cannot be considered secondary nor weak instruments to approach to the reality analysis.

AB  - The Digital Revolution we are witnessing has started a new era in modern societies and economies. Time inputs, whether these are from human beings and non-human, electronical or mechanical devices are increasingly more important, especially –but not uniquely– in most advanced economies and societies. Existing economic theory strives to accommodate time inputs into mainstream economic theory. This paper contributes to the existing literature on time allocation theoretical models by suggesting a general equilibrium framework likely to respond to some existing challenges in modern economies. In the general equilibrium modelling process, some improvements are made to time allocation models from the consumer side which concern the inclusion of non-human time inputs and multitasking, and a novel development on a producer theory of allocation of time is designed to determine the underpinnings of a computationally tractable general equilibrium theory of allocation of time. Both the solution and usefulness of this work will require the help of cutting-edge computational techniques in future work.

AB  - Conventional solid oral dosage form development is not typically challenged by reliance on an amorphous drug substance as a direct ingredient in the drug product, as this may result in product development hurdles arising from process design and scale-up, control of physical quality attributes, drug product processability and stability. Here, we present the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls development journey behind the successful commercialization of an amorphous drug substance, Elagolix Sodium, a first-in-class, orally active gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. The reason behind the lack of crystalline state was assessed via Molecular Dynamics (MD) at the molecular and inter-molecular level, revealing barriers for nucleation due to prevalence of intra-molecular hydrogen bond, repulsive interactions between active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) molecules and strong solvation effects. To provide a foundational basis for the design of the API manufacturing process, we modeled the solvent-induced plasticization behavior experimentally and computationally via MD for insights into molecular mobility. In addition, we applied material science tetrahedron concepts to link API porosity to drug product tablet compressibility. Finally, we designed the API isolation process, incorporating computational fluid dynamics modeling in the design of an impinging jet mixer for precipitation and solvent-dependent glass transition relationships in the cake wash, blow-down and drying process, to enable the consistent manufacture of a porous, non-sintered amorphous API powder that is suitable for robust drug product manufacturing.

AB  - This paper presents a historical perspective on the origin of the enactive approach to cognitive science, starting chronologically from cybernetics, with the aim of clarifying its main concepts, such as enaction, autopoiesis, structural coupling and natural drift; thus showing their influences in computational approaches and models of cognitive architecture. Works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines. Finally, the article stresses the importance of the enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the largest challenges today.

AB  - This article views social entrepreneurship as a relatively new model for achieving sustainable development. It also identifies development narratives that social entrepreneurs (SEs) construct to represent and promote their work as an important research gap in development studies. Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009–2013 and 1994–1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a ‘bottom-up’ approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals. Overall, this study identifies the increasing importance of SEs in the development industry and reveals new aspects of SEs—their latent political framing, collective-utilitarian identities, and topical areas—that require further research via development narratives.

It’s a big task. Further, a course may play a particular role in the curriculum, serving as a prerequisite, a capstone, or the course in which students learn a particular skill. How do you pick on what to focus, and how do you organize your course to help your students be able to transfer their knowledge to a new setting? How can you design the course to help your students build a conceptual framework that can expand and grow as their understanding grows? This chapter describes six principles to guide your course design and provides suggestions for more detailed resources.

AB  - Stacking fault (SF), originating from the emission of partial dislocations, wields significant influence over the structural and physicochemical traits of ceramic materials. Yet, the intricate atomic dynamics driving SF nucleation remain obscured. Here, we introduce an improved methodology for computing the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) in ceramics, integrating uneven Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) for distinct lattice sites. This refinement has yielded substantial energy advantages over the traditional rigid shift method inherited from metallic systems. Our findings underscore that the relaxation of nonmetallic N atoms within the SF region is pivotal for achieving a more realistic SF simulation. This, in turn, unveils the involvement of N atom migration within the SF region between different aluminum tetrahedral sites during SF nucleation. By alleviating the energy barrier, this relaxation contrasts with previous simulations where nonmetallic elements remained more rigid. This work demonstrates the atomic dynamics of SF nucleation in ceramics and breaks the conventional wisdom of uniformly applying constraints for GSFE computations.

AB  - The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been implicated in the regulation of stress-related cognitive processes and physiological responses and is the principal target of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques applied to psychiatric conditions. However, existing studies are mostly correlational and causal evidence on the role of this region in mediating specific psychophysiological mechanisms underpinning stress-related responses are needed to make the application of such techniques more efficient. To fill this gap, this study used inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in healthy individuals to examine the extent to which activity of the left dlPFC is associated with cognitive (subjective focus on a tracking task), behavioral (reaction times and variability), and physiological responses (heart rate and its variability and cortisol level) following induction of perseverative cognition. Compared to sham and left ventral PreMotor area stimulation (as active control area), inhibition of left dlPFC determined sustained autonomic and neuroendocrine activation and increased the subjective perception of being task-focused, while not changing the behavioral and self-reported stress-related responses. Adopting a causative approach, we describe a role of left dlPFC in inhibitory control of the physiological stress-response associated to perseverative thinking.

AB  - In this paper we aim to give an analysis and cognitive rationalization of a common practice or strategy of modeling in systems biology known as a middle-out modeling strategy. The strategy in the cases we look at is facilitated through the construction of what can be called mesoscopic models. Many models built in computational systems biology are mesoscopic (midsize) in scale. Such models lack the sufficient fidelity to serve as robust predictors of the behaviors of complex biological systems, one of the signature goals of the field. This puts some pressure on the field to provide reasons for why and how these practices are warranted despite not meeting the stated goals of the field. Using the results of ethnographic study of problem-solving practices in systems biology, we aim to examine the middle-out strategy and mesoscopic modeling in detail and to show that these practices are rational responses to complex problem solving tasks on cognitive grounds in particular. However making this claim requires us to update the standard notion of bounded rationality to take account of how human cognition is coupled to computation in these contexts. Our account fleshes out the idea that has been raised by some philosophers on the “hybrid” nature of computational modeling and simulation. What we call “coupling” both extends modelers’ capacities to handle complex systems, but also produces various cognitive and computational constraints which need to be taken into account in any computational problem solving strategy seeking to maintain insight and control over the models produced.

AB  - Process systems engineering (PSE) has been an active research field for almost 50 years. Modeling, simulation and optimization technologies have been developed to a mature state. These technologies have been penetrating all fields of chemical engineering in academia as well as in industrial practice. Systems thinking has been established in industrial practice largely through powerful commercial process simulation software and through mandatory courses in most chemical engineering programs. This contribution reflects on the past, present and future of PSE. Special emphasis will be on the perspectives of this field from an academic and industrial point of view.

AB  - This chapter reports 11 experiments that were done to determine whether Guided Cognition-designed homework facilitates learning middle school mathematics, and if so, to determine how it helps and what is learned. Experiments were performed in two middle schools and included 8th graders in two experiments and 7th graders in nine experiments. Mathematics topics ranged from fractions to integers to geometry. As in the literature experiments, students were in their normal school environment following their regular curriculum and were unaware that their learning was being observed. Guided Cognition design was found to be effective for learning mathematics. Working story problems that were enriched with cognitive events such as role play, divergent thinking, visualizing and illustrating, and relating to prior experience raised scores on unexpected quizzes by about a letter grade. Another unexpected quiz found that the improvements in problem-solving performance persisted for 6months. Guided Cognition homework was also found to be efficient in that students who worked eight problems and then performed four cognitive events performed as well on unexpected quizzes as students who worked 24 problems in the same time interval. Another pair of experiments determined that modest gains could be made from merely reading completed examples of cognitive events, but that these gains were not long-lasting. Performing the cognitive events was found to be most effective for long-term performance. Another experiment found that experiencing cognitive events after working some mathematics problems can help consolidate knowledge of how to work such problems.

AB  - Urgent calls to transform societies toward more sustainability make the practice of anticipation more and more necessary. The progressive development of computational technologies has opened room for a growing use of quantitative methods to explore the future of social-ecological systems, in addition to qualitative methods. This warrants investigating issues of power relationships and discontinuities and unknowns that arise when mingling quantitative and qualitative anticipatory methods. We first reflected on the semantics attached to these methods. We then conducted a comparative analysis on the way the articulation of quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted, based on an in-depth analysis of a set of eleven anticipatory projects completed by several external case studies. We propose insights to classify projects according to the timing (successive, iterative or convergent) and the purpose of the articulation (imagination, refinement, assessment and awareness raising). We use these insights to explore methodological implications and power relationships and then discuss the ways to inform or frame anticipatory projects that seek to combine these methods.

AB  - Organizations need management models, which will enable their executives to develop systemic thinking. In addition, executives should keep in mind that: some decision-making processes should be shared; impose political influence according to their preferences; value innovation strategies may be present; it is essential to consider the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability. In this context, this study describes a model to hierarchize strategic decisions according to criteria innovation value, sustainability and budgetary constraint, developed according to the methodology proposed by Mitroff et al. (1974). In addition to hierarchizing, the model allows identifying the degree of importance of each of the strategic decisions in the performance indicators defined as evaluation criteria and sub-criteria. In the conceptualization phase, the model is influenced by concepts that describe complex adaptive systems. Next, the Analytic Network Process with Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and Risks Analysis and Linear Programming techniques are used in order to define the mathematical structure that operationalizes the model. The use of a hypothetical example demonstrates the capacity of the model proposed in this work to support the decision-making process of an organization in the selection of its decision alternatives. Thus, the model can help the academic and business communities concerned with the progress of sustainable societies, insofar as it subsidizes decision-making for the development and implementation of new products and processes related to cleaner production.

AB  - The rapid development and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have made the development of AI-specific design methods an important topic to advance. In recent decades, the centre of gravity in AI has shifted away from cognitive science and related fields like psychology. However, there is a clear need and potential for added value in returning to stronger interaction. One potential challenge for this interaction may be the lack of common conceptual grounds and design languages. In this article, we aim to contribute to the development of conceptual interfaces for human-based AI-specific design methods through the idea of cognitive mimetics. We begin by introducing basic concepts from mimetic design and interpret them in the context of this thematic area. These provide some of the basic building blocks for a design language and bring to the surface key questions. These in turn provide a ground for explicating cognitive mimetics. In the second part of this paper, we focus on specifying a key aspect in cognitive mimetics: the contents of information processes. Others engaged in this field can derive value from using or developing the basic conceptual machinery to specify their own approaches in this interdisciplinary field that is still shaping itself. Furthermore, those who resonate with the idea of cognitive mimetics, as specified here, can join in taking this particular approach further.

AB  - Emerging narratives around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning place great faith in these technologies’ ability to ameliorate threats posed by climate change. They promise the capacity to analyze vast amounts of more precise and real-time data, improving how decision-makers predict, respond, and adapt. Yet scholars in political ecology have long observed that technocentric approaches typically reduce complex human-environment relationships in ways that fail to account for social relations and power dynamics. This paper charts the emerging political economy of “climate AI” – the philanthropies, NGOs, private consultancies, and tech giants investing in data-driven climate initiatives. Mapping out two case studies, we show that environmental and climate crises are grist for tech solutions and find that many climate AI actors are interested in it for surveillance, greenwashing, and commodifying algorithms. We pay special attention to how neocolonial and racialized power structures manifest in climate AI and outline three ways for political ecologists and digital geographers to research its socio-materiality: how computational resources are environmentally embedded, how disasters become “shocks” that the AI industry capitalizes on, and how climate AI shapes material investment flows and landscapes. Highlighting how data-driven approaches to climate crises reproduce injustices already faced by marginalized communities, our analysis contributes to research on environmental data justice.

This complexity cannot be grasped with intuition alone and is not appropriately captured by reductionist methods, which have been dominating biology and medicine for the past decades. Experimental and computational systems biology have the potential of generating adequate datasets and analyzing them in a manner that captures the complexity of health and disease systems in a personalized manner. This potential has not yet fully materialized, but examples and case studies provide a glimpse of the power these approaches are likely to have in the future.

AB  - Nowadays, the purpose of human genomics is widely emerging in health-related problems and also to achieve time and cost-efficient healthcare. Due to advancement in genomics and its research, development in privacy concerns is needed regarding querying, accessing and, storage and computation of the genomic data. While the genomic data is widely accessible, the privacy issues may emerge due to the untrusted third party (adversaries/researchers), they may reveal the information or strategy plans regarding the genome data of an individual when it is requested for research purposes. To mitigate this problem many privacy-preserving techniques are used along with cryptographic methods are briefly discussed. Furthermore, efficiency and accuracy in a secure and private genomic data computation are needed to be researched in future.

The ratio of the Hankel norm of the subsystems in closed and open loop are used to state a modified version of HIIA, which has improved characteristics compared to the original HIIA. Properties of the modified HIIA are discussed and benchmarked with established methods on three example cases.

AB  - Along with the process of building China's modern vocational education system, China's higher vocational education has made great progress. With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability.

AB  - The majority of AI literacy studies have designed and developed self-reported questionnaires to assess AI learning and understanding. These studies assessed students' perceived AI capability rather than AI literacy because self-perceptions are seldom an accurate account of true measures. International assessment programs that use objective measures to assess science, mathematical, digital, and computational literacy back up this argument. Furthermore, because AI education research is still in its infancy, the current definition of AI literacy in the literature may not meet the needs of young students. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test for school students within the interdisciplinary project known as AI4future. Engineering and education researchers created and selected 25 multiple-choice questions to accomplish this goal, and school teachers validated them while developing an AI curriculum for middle schools. 2390 students in grades 7 to 9 took the test. We used a Rasch model to investigate the discrimination, reliability, and validity of the items. The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items. They indicate the quality of the test items. The test enables AI education researchers and practitioners to appropriately evaluate their AI-related education interventions.

AB  - Subjects in simple games frequently exhibit non-equilibrium behaviors. Cognitive hierarchy (CH) and level k (LK) are two prevailing structural models that capture such behaviors well. This paper proposes a generalized CH (GCH) model that nests a variant of the LK model, called LM. GCH differs from CH in two ways. First, each lower level's actual frequency is exponentially weighted with α to form level-k's belief on relative proportions; α captures stereotype bias. CH assumes no stereotype bias (α=1) and LM assumes extreme bias (α=∞). Second, GCH replaces random choice with minimum aversion for level 0. Level 0s are more likely to choose strategies that never yield the minimum payoff for any of the opponent's strategies. GCH captures behaviors better than CH and LK in fifty-five n×m games from four datasets. Robustness tests using three new games further validate GCHs descriptive strength over CH and LK.

Pupil size is a widely used metric of brain state. It is one of the few signals originating from the brain that can be readily monitored with low-cost devices in basic science, clinical, and home settings. It is, therefore, important to investigate and generate well-defined theories related to specific interpretations of this metric. What exactly does it tell us about the brain? Pupils constrict in response to light and dilate during darkness, but the brain also controls pupil size irrespective of luminosity. Pupil size fluctuations resulting from ongoing “brain states” are used as a metric of arousal, but what is pupil-linked arousal and how should it be interpreted in neural, cognitive, and computational terms? Here, we discuss some recent findings related to these issues. We identify open questions and propose how to answer them through a combination of well-defined tasks, neurocomputational models, and neurophysiological probing of the interconnected loops of causes and consequences of pupil size.

AB  - Learning the science of heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis always starts with the simple case of a flat, uniform surface with an ideal adsorbate. It has of course been recognized for a century that real catalysts are more complicated. For the increasingly complex catalysts of the 21st century, this Perspective argues that surface heterogeneity and non-ideal binding isotherms are central features, and their implications need to be incorporated in current thinking. A variety of systems are described herein where catalyst complexity leads to broad, non-Langmuirian surface isotherms for the binding of hydrogen atoms – and this occurs even for ideal, flat Pt(111) surfaces. Modern catalysis employs nanoscale materials whose surfaces have substantial step, edge, corner, impurity, and other defect sites, and they increasingly have both metallic and non-metallic elements MnXm, including metal oxides, chalcogenides, pnictides, carbides, doped carbons, etc. The surfaces of such catalysts are often not crystal facets of the bulk phase underneath, and they typically have a variety of potential active sites. Catalytic surfaces in operando are often non-stoichiometric, amorphous, dynamic, and impure, and often vary from one part of the surface to another. Understanding of the issues that arise at such nanoscale, multi-element catalysts is just beginning to emerge. Yet these catalysts are widely discussed using Brønsted/Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations, volcano plots, Tafel slopes, the Butler-Volmer equation, and other linear free energy relations (LFERs), which all depend on the implicit assumption that the active sites are “similar” and that surface adsorption is close to ideal. These assumptions underly the ubiquitous intuition based on the Sabatier Principle, that the fastest catalysis will occur when key intermediates have free energies of adsorption that are not too strong nor too weak. Current catalysis research often aims to minimize the complexity of non-ideal isotherms through experimental and computational design (e.g., the use of single crystal surfaces), and these studies are the foundation of the field. In contrast, this Perspective argues that the heterogeneity of binding sites and binding energies is an inherent strength of these catalysts. This diversity makes many nanoscale catalysts inherently a high-throughput screen wrapped in a tiny package. Only by making the heterogeneity part of the foundation of catalysis models, sorting the types of active sites and dissecting non-ideal binding isotherms, will modern catalysis learn to harness the inherent diversity of real catalysts. Controlling and exploiting diversity rather than avoiding it will help to optimize complex modern catalysts and catalytic conditions.

Some autistic people describe their social performances as ‘camouflaging’ and engage in these performances to mitigate social challenges and survive in the neurotypical world. Here, we reconsider autistic camouflaging under the unifying framework of impression management (IM) by examining overlapping and unique motivations, neurocognitive mechanisms, and consequences. Predictive coding and Bayesian principles are synthesized into a computational model of IM that applies to autistic and neurotypical people. Throughout, we emphasize the inherently transactional, context-dependent nature of IM, the distinct computational challenges faced by autistic people, and the psychological toll that compelled IM can take. Viewing camouflaging through this lens highlights the pressing needs to change societal attitudes, destigmatize autism, refine social skills-building programs for autistic individuals, and integrate these programs with environment-focused support.

AB  - Development of design-by-analogy tools is a promising design innovation research avenue. Previously, a method for computationally structuring patent databases as a basis for an automated design-by-analogy tool was introduced. To demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses, a computationally-generated structure is compared to four expert designers' mental models of the domain. Results indicate that, compared to experts, the computationally-generated structure is sensible in clustering of patents and organization of clusters. The computationally-generated structure represents a space in which experts can find common ground/consensus – making it promising to be intuitive/accessible to broad cohorts of designers. The computational method offers a resource-efficient way of usefully conceptualizing the space that is sensible to expert designers, while maintaining an element of unexpected representation of the space.

AB  - Despite the proliferation of video-based instruction and its benefits—such as promoting student autonomy and self-paced learning—the complexities of online teaching remain a challenge. To be effective, educators require extensive training in digital teaching methodologies. As such, there's a pressing need to examine and comprehend the intricacies of instructors' communication patterns within this context. This research addresses the pressing need to understand pedagogical discourse in online video lectures in Algebra classes by employing computational linguistic tools and natural language processing (NLP). Using transcripts from 125 Algebra 1 video lectures—comprising 4962 instances of pedagogical discourse—from five instructors at Math Nation, a virtual math learning environment, we analyzed the conveyance of linguistic, attitudinal, and emotional nuances. With the aid of 26 Coh-Metrix and SÉANCE features, we classified educators' language choices, achieving an accuracy of 86.7%. Furthermore, variations in language choices, as signified by discourse markers, were examined through a K-means clustering approach. The resulting 17 clusters were grouped into interpersonal, structural, and cognitive pedagogic functions. Through this exploration, we demonstrate the promising potential of NLP in efficiently deciphering pedagogical communication patterns in video lectures. These insights open a new avenue for research, aimed at assessing the efficacy of digital instruction by scrutinizing pedagogical discourse characteristics in computer-based learning environments.
