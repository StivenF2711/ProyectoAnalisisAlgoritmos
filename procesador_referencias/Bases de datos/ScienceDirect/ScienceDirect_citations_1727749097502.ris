AB  - Testosterone has been implicated in the regulation of emotional responses and risky decision-making. However, the causal effect of testosterone upon emotional decision-making, especially in non-social settings, is still unclear. The present study investigated the role of testosterone in counterfactual thinking: regret is an intense negative emotion that arises from comparison of an obtained outcome from a decision against a better, non-obtained (i.e. counterfactual) alternative. Healthy male participants (n = 64) received a single-dose of 150 mg testosterone Androgel in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-participants design. At 180 min post-administration, participants performed the counterfactual thinking task. We applied a computational model derived from behavioral economic principles to uncover latent decision-making mechanisms that may be invisible in simple choice analyses. Our data showed that testosterone increased the ability to use anticipated regret to guide choice behavior, while reducing choice based on expected value. On affective ratings, testosterone increased sensitivity to both obtained and counterfactual outcomes. These findings provide evidence that testosterone causally modulates emotional decision-making, and highlight the role of testosterone in affective sensitivity.

AB  - Research activity in the field of estimation of genetic risks of ionizing radiation to human populations started in the late 1940s and now appears to be passing through a plateau phase. This paper provides a background to the concepts, findings and methods of risk estimation that guided the field through the period of its growth to the beginning of the 21st century. It draws attention to several key facts: (a) thus far, genetic risk estimates have been made indirectly using mutation data collected in mouse radiation studies; (b) important uncertainties and unsolved problems remain, one notable example being that we still do not know the sensitivity of human female germ cells to radiation-induced mutations; and (c) the concept that dominated the field thus far, namely, that radiation exposures to germ cells can result in single gene diseases in the descendants of those exposed has been replaced by the concept that radiation exposure can cause DNA deletions, often involving more than one gene. Genetic risk estimation now encompasses work devoted to studies on DNA deletions induced in human germ cells, their expected frequencies, and phenotypes and associated clinical consequences in the progeny. We argue that the time is ripe to embark on a human genome-based, mechanism-driven, computational modeling of genetic risks of ionizing radiation, and we present a provisional framework for catalyzing research in the field in the 21st century.

AB  - Eye tracking is one of the techniques used to investigate cognitive mechanisms involved in the school context, such as joint attention and visual perception. Eye tracker has portability, straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and infant-friendly neuroimaging measures of cognitive processes such as attention, engagement, and learning. Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies.

AB  - In Bayesian analysis the class of conjugate models allows to obtain exact posterior distributions, however this class quite restrictive in the sense that it involves only a few distributions. In fact, most of the practical applications involves non-conjugate models, thus approximate methods, such as the MCMC algorithms, are required. Although these methods can deal with quite complex structures, some practical problems can make their applications quite time demanding, for example, when we use heavy-tailed distributions, convergence may be difficult, also the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can become very slow, in addition to the extra work inevitably required on choosing efficient candidate generator distributions. In this work, we draw attention to the special functions as a tools for Bayesian computation, we propose an alternative method for obtaining the posterior distribution in Gaussian non-conjugate models in an exact form. We use complex integration methods based on the H-function in order to obtain the posterior distribution and some of its posterior quantities in an explicit computable form. Two examples are provided in order to illustrate the theory.

China offers the ultimate in data-at-scale settings, and the construction of real-world natural experiments. Chinese e-commerce includes some of the largest firms involved in e-commerce, mobile commerce, social media and social networks. This article was written to encourage young faculty and doctoral students to engage in research that can be carried out in near real-time, with truly experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and with the clear intention of establishing causal inferences that relate the precursors and drivers of observable outcomes through various kinds of processes. We discuss: the relevant data sources and research contexts; the methods perspectives that are appropriate which blend Computer Science, Statistics and Econometrics, how the research can be made relevant for China; and what kinds of findings and research directions are available. This article is not a tutorial on big data analytics methods in general though, nor does it cover just those published works that demonstrate big data methods and empirical causality in other disciplines. Instead, the empirical research covered is mostly taken from Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, which has published many articles on Chinese e-commerce. This Research Commentary invites researchers in China and the Asia Pacific region to expand their coverage to bring into their empirical work the new methods and philosophy of causal data science.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between learning and creativity in early elementary students using both static and growth achievement scores in reading and mathematics. Participants were kindergarten and first grade students from the Midwestern United States. Initial correlations demonstrated significant positive relationships between students’ performance on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking –Figural (TTCT-F) and static academic achievement scores in both reading and mathematics, but that same relationship did not exist with academic growth scores. Specifically, when academic growth was examined further using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a complex picture emerged, such that grade level (i.e., kindergarten v. first grade) and subscale type (e.g., Fluency v. Originality) influenced the significance and nature of the relationship (i.e., linear v. nonlinear). In general, as students increased in creativity performance, they demonstrated less academic growth. Future work should explore the underlying mechanisms explaining these relationships to better help students leverage their creative abilities for positive academic gains in the classroom setting.

AB  - To foster the development of pedagogically potent and ethically sound AI-integrated learning landscapes, it is pivotal to critically explore the perceptions and experiences of the users immersed in these contexts. In this study, we perform a thorough qualitative content analysis across four key social media platforms. Our goal is to understand the user experience (UX) and views of early adopters of ChatGPT across different educational sectors. The results of our research show that ChatGPT is most commonly used in the domains of higher education, K-12 education, and practical skills training. In social media dialogues, the topics most frequently associated with ChatGPT are productivity, efficiency, and ethics. Early adopters' attitudes towards ChatGPT are multifaceted. On one hand, some users view it as a transformative tool capable of amplifying student self-efficacy and learning motivation. On the other hand, there is a degree of apprehension among concerned users. They worry about a potential overdependence on the AI system, which they fear might encourage superficial learning habits and erode students’ social and critical thinking skills. This dichotomy of opinions underscores the complexity of Human-AI Interaction in educational contexts. Our investigation adds depth to this ongoing discourse, providing crowd-sourced insights for educators and learners who are considering incorporating ChatGPT or similar generative AI tools into their pedagogical strategies.

AB  - Methods for inferring species trees from gene trees motivated by incomplete lineage sorting typically use either rooted gene trees to infer a rooted species tree, or use unrooted gene trees to infer an unrooted species tree, which is then typically rooted using one or more outgroups. Theoretically, however, it has been known since 2011 that it is possible to consistently infer the root of the species tree directly from unrooted gene trees without assuming an outgroup. Here, we use approximate Bayesian computation to infer the root of the species tree from unrooted gene trees assuming the multispecies coalescent model. It is hoped that this approach will be useful in cases where an appropriate outgroup is difficult to find and gene trees do not follow a molecular clock. We use approximate Bayesian computation to infer the root of the species tree from unrooted gene trees. This approach could also be useful when there is prior information that makes a small number of root locations plausible in an unrooted species tree.

AB  - Investment in agricultural conservation practices (CPs) to address Lake Erie's re-eutrophication may offer benefits that extend beyond the lake, such as improved habitat conditions for fish communities throughout the watershed. If such conditions are not explicitly considered in Lake Erie nutrient management strategies, however, this opportunity might be missed. Herein, we quantify the potential for common CPs that will be used to meet nutrient management goals for Lake Erie to simultaneously improve stream biological conditions throughout the western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) watershed. To do so, we linked a high-resolution watershed-hydrology model to predictive biological models in a conservation scenario framework. Our modeling simulations showed that the implementation of CPs on farm acres in critical and moderate need of treatment, representing nearly half of the watershed, would be needed to reduce spring/early summer total phosphorus loads from the WLEB watershed to acceptable levels. This widespread CP implementation also would improve potential stream biological conditions in >11,000km of streams and reduce the percentage of streams where water quality is limiting biological conditions, from 31% to 20%. Despite these improvements, we found that even with additional treatment of acres in low need of CPs, degraded water quality conditions would limit biological conditions in >3200streamkm. Thus, while we expect CPs to play an important role in mitigating eutrophication problems in the Lake Erie ecosystem, additional strategies and emerging technologies appear necessary to fully reduce water quality limitation throughout the watershed.

This chapter provides a summary of the literature on the network neuroscience of creativity, providing a twofold argument by separately detailing research in domain-general and domain-specific creativity. The first section will concern two main lines of research on domain-general creativity: (1) the neurocognitive mechanisms of creative cognition (how brain networks map onto specific cognitive processes involved in creative thinking), and (2) the individual differences in brain network connectivity and creative ability (how brain networks relate to differences in creative abilities). The second section, on domain-specific creativity, will then consider three domains of artistic creativity: (1) music improvisation, (2) figural creativity, and (3) literary creativity. Throughout this chapter we discuss common themes and shared findings between domain-general and domain-specific creativity. We will then conclude by outlining some of the limitations in the literature and by providing some directions for future research.

KW  - Meta-heuristic optimization algorithm
AB  - The search domain of meta-heuristic algorithms is always constantly changing, which make it difficult to adapt the diverse optimization issues. To overcome above issue, an evolutionary updating mechanism called Memory Backtracking Strategy (MBS) is proposed, which contains thinking stage, recall stage, and memory stage. Overall, the adoption of the MBS enhances the efficiency of MHSs by incorporating group memory, clue recall, and memory forgetting mechanisms. These strategies improve the algorithm's ability to explore the search space, optimize the search process, and escape local optima. MBS will be applied to three different types of MHS algorithms: evolutionary based (LSHADE_SPACMA), physical based (Stochastic Fractal Search, SFS), and biological based (Marine Predators Algorithmnm, MPA) to demonstrate the universality of MBS. In the experimental section including 57 engineering problems, algorithm complexity analysis, CEC2020 Friedman ranking, convergence curve, Wilcoxon statistical, and box plot. Among them, 21 algorithms participated in the Friedman experiment, including MBS_LSHADE_SPACMA ranked first, LSHADE_SPACMA ranked second, MBS_MPA ranked 6th, MPA ranked 8th, MBS_SFS ranked 9th and SFS ranked 12th. Combined with the analysis of "MBS testing analysis" and the experimental results of engineering problems, it has proven that MBS has universality and good ability to improve optimization algorithm performance. The source codes of the proposed MBS (MBS_MPA) can be accessed by https://github.com/luchenghao2022/Memory-Backtracking-Strategy

AB  - The need for autonomous engineering graduates who demonstrate hands-on skills has increased in the industry. Computer programming helps engineering students solve real-world problems systematically and accurately by applying governing physical and mathematical models into a format that a computer can read and execute. This study describes the pedagogical approach of incorporating programming workshops and assessments into a second-year chemical engineering course. The impact of this intervention on experiential learning amongst the students was then evaluated by analysing the feedback provided by voluntary participants during several focus group sessions. The feedback gave further insight into teaching pedagogy with respect to Kolb's experiential learning cycle. It was found the programming background of an individual clearly affects the phase of the learning cycle they predominantly experience during the workshops. Furthermore, programming background affected an individual's critical thinking while approaching an engineering problem. Constructive feedback provided by the student participants offered an invaluable opportunity for the teaching team to reflect on what went well and the areas for improvement in future iterations. The findings of this study can advance knowledge around design and implementation of a programming module within an engineering course.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Molecular metal oxides often adopt common structural frameworks (i.e. archetypes), many of them boasting impressive structural robustness and stability. However, the ability to adapt and to undergo transformations between different structural archetypes is a desirable material design feature offering applicability in different environments. Using systems thinking approach that integrates synthetic, analytical and computational techniques, we explore the transformations governing the chemistry of polyoxovanadates (POVs) constructed of arsenate and vanadate building units. The water-soluble salt of the low nuclearity polyanion [V6As8O26]4− can be effectively used for the synthesis of the larger spherical (i.e. kegginoidal) mixed-valent [V12As8O40]4− precipitate, while the novel [V10As12O40]8− POVs having tubular cyclic structures are another, well soluble product. Surprisingly, in contrast to the common observation that high-nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are fragmented to form smaller moieties in solution, the low nuclearity [V6As8O26]4− anion is in situ transformed into the higher nuclearity cluster anions. The obtained products support a conceptually new model that is outlined in this article and that describes a continuous evolution between spherical and cyclic POV assemblies. This new model represents a milestone on the way to rational and designable POV self-assemblies.

AB  - Analog integrated circuit (IC) design highly depends on reasoning, which distinguishes itself from other areas of IC design. Most of its innovation arises from qualitative reasoning by a pencil and paper. Innovation on the circuit structure needs quick analytical justification. Circuit-level reduced-scale modeling is a popular reasoning means. Circuit simulation tools can only serve partial justification on a design, while design insight still has to be acquired via manual analysis. A basic question has been in existence for many decades: how can we automate the analog IC design process? Many analog synthesis tools proposed decades ago could not make it to this date in the design practice. In this survey the major reason is attributed to the black-box style of the tool design. Human designer's creativity is shielded away from the tool operation while the formal design knowledge hardcoded in those tools remains at a very primitive level. By analyzing the defects of those existing tools, this survey advocates an open tool development philosophy whose major goal is to support human-machine interaction. On the one side a design automation tool is mainly aimed at providing aid for tasks that require analytical deduction while on the other side designers are expected to exercise their creativity based on the machine-generated results. Such human-machine co-working style is believed to be a more feasible solution to analog IC design automation based on the currently available computation technology. In this survey the art of symbolic computation is promoted to be the enabling technology for computer-aided analytical generation. The symbolic computation technology today can support topological and analytical reasoning that is the most demanding need in the analog IC design practice. This survey further calls for more research on the formal methods that are applicable to design knowledge representation, human-machine interaction, and design inference. Some preliminary research results are reviewed and future research directions are pointed out.

AB  - We are developing a rigorous methodology to analyse experimental computation, by which we mean the idea of computing a set or function by experimenting with some physical equipment. Here we consider experimental computation by kinematic systems under both Newtonian and relativistic kinematics. An experimental procedure, expressed in a language similar to imperative programming languages, is applied to equipment, having the form of a bagatelle, and is interpreted using the two theories. We prove that for any set A of natural numbers there exists a two-dimensional kinematic system BA with a single particle P whose observable behaviour decides n∈A for all n∈N. The procedure can operate under (a) Newtonian mechanics or (b) relativistic mechanics. The proofs show how any information (coded by some A) can be embedded in the structure of a simple kinematic system and retrieved by simple observations of its behaviour. We reflect on the methodology, which seeks a formal theory for performing abstract experiments with physical restrictions on the construction of systems. We conclude with some open problems.

AB  - The development of generative AI has led to novel ways that technology can be integrated into creative activities. However, this has also raised concerns about how human creators will be affected, and what impact it may have on creative industries. As a result, there has been research into how we can design AI tools that work with human creators, rather than replacing them. In this paper we review approaches utilized to build AI tools that facilitate human creativity and allow users to engage fully and authentically in the creative process. These include leveraging AI models to help us shed light on elements of the creative process, building interfaces that encourage exploration of ideas, and designing technological affordances that can support the development of new creative practices.

KW  - Phonology in human cognition
AB  - Chomskyan generative grammar has long been committed to the ‘double-interface’ assumption that the faculty of language (FL) serves two interfaces, PF and LF, and correlatively that expressions have phonological and semantic properties. The paper argues this gives rise to (a) a grounding problem for syntax – i.e. for the interpretable content of syntax – and (b) a problem for the assumption that FL is a generative computation. It is argued these problems are resolved if we think of syntax as grounded exclusively in semantic/conceptual properties. Since this implies that FL is phonology-free, it is argued that FL should not be distinguished from a generative computation describable as ‘the language of thought’ (LOT). The paper explores to what extent this (FL=LOT) thesis is consistent with Chomsky's thinking. Chomsky's recent work can be seen as pointing in that direction but it is not consistent with the double-interface assumption, which he continues to regard as conceptually necessary. In the light of discussion of the issues, the paper concludes with a speculation on the role of phonology in human cognition and its evolution.

AB  - Cell-free synthetic biology is emerging as a powerful approach aimed to understand, harness, and expand the capabilities of natural biological systems without using intact cells. Cell-free systems bypass cell walls and remove genetic regulation to enable direct access to the inner workings of the cell. The unprecedented level of control and freedom of design, relative to in vivo systems, has inspired the rapid development of engineering foundations for cell-free systems in recent years. These efforts have led to programmed circuits, spatially organized pathways, co-activated catalytic ensembles, rational optimization of synthetic multi-enzyme pathways, and linear scalability from the micro-liter to the 100-liter scale. It is now clear that cell-free systems offer a versatile test-bed for understanding why nature's designs work the way they do and also for enabling biosynthetic routes to novel chemicals, sustainable fuels, and new classes of tunable materials. While challenges remain, the emergence of cell-free systems is poised to open the way to novel products that until now have been impractical, if not impossible, to produce by other means.

AB  - Automated and intelligent negotiation solutions for reaching service level agreements (SLA) represent a hot research topic in computational grids. Previous work regarding SLA negotiation in grids focuses on devising bargaining models where service providers and consumers can meet and exchange SLA offers and counteroffers. Recent developments in agent research introduce strategies based on opponent learning for contract negotiation. In this paper we design a generic framework for strategical negotiation of service level values under time constraints and exemplify the usage of our framework by extending the Bayesian learning agent to cope with the limited duration of a negotiation session. We prove that opponent learning strategies are worth for consideration in open competitive computational grids, leading towards an optimal allocation of resources and fair satisfaction of participants.

AB  - Medical device development consists of ideation, prototyping, simulation, preclinical testing, and clinical trials. In the early stages, design and test iterations offer insights to incorporate into subsequent iterations and should be repeated often with only as much complexity as necessary. Computational simulations, in the form of analytic calculations or finite element analysis (FEA), can be utilized for design concept screening all the way to design verification testing under design control. For FEA, while the mathematics is complicated, and the programming is intricate, the utility of the simulation is only as good as the realism of the anatomic loading boundary conditions. While boundary conditions may not be able to be prescribed exactly as they happen in vivo, good engineering intuition and judgment are invaluable for making reasonable approximations.

AB  - Various methods have been developed for automated and semi-automated architecture generation in the computer aided ship design processes. The question remains as to how this can speed up the design process without losing the requirement elucidation intent for concept phase. This paper presents a novel approach with a software toolset to develop design and analysis approaches to early stage ship design and provide a sketching tool. This was done by enhancing the user interface and experience of the UCL Network Block Approach to achieve a “thinking sketch” in a way that is “quick” and “fluid” enough to promote inventive and creative sketching comparable to hand sketching. The UCL Network Block Approach draws on the UCL Design Building Block (DBB) approach and uses network methods applied to the synthesis of distributed ship service systems (DS3) and Computer Aided Ship Design (CASD) to expand DS3 definition in early stage ship design. The UCL originated inside-out/DBB approach to sketch driven synthesis has been made translatable to both DBB ship descriptions and ensuring early stage naval architectural “balance”. The proposed approach has been used for the first time successfully to not only carry out a rapid sketching exercise for a naval ship design but also enable quick preliminary analysis of a set of DS3 networks.

AB  - We rely on our visual system to cope with the vast barrage of incoming light patterns and to extract features from the scene that are relevant to our well-being. The necessary reduction of visual information already begins in the eye. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the computations performed in the vertebrate retina and how they are implemented by the neural circuitry. A new picture emerges from these findings that helps resolve a vexing paradox between the retina's structure and function. Whereas the conventional wisdom treats the eye as a simple prefilter for visual images, it now appears that the retina solves a diverse set of specific tasks and provides the results explicitly to downstream brain areas.

This chapter presents a review and criticism of the actual innovation approaches, highlighting how the social and economic scenario imposes the necessity of rethinking innovation and consumption models. Specifically, we discuss how the recent crises – which together affect finance, food and climate change and their implications for human development – are forcing organisations to find new solutions and models for responding to emerging needs and expectations. In this regard, we elaborate on the important role that may be played by traditional knowledge as a source of inspiration for innovation, since creativity can find a reliable support in what society has found to be suitable in the past for its development needs.

AB  - Safe egress is one of the key design issues identified by facility planners, manager and inspectors. Computational tools are now available for the simulation and design of emergency evacuation and egress. However, these tools rely heavily on assumptions about individual human and social behaviors, which have been found to be oversimplified, inconsistent and even incorrect. Furthermore, the behaviors are usually incorporated into the computational model in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a framework for studying human and social behavior, from the perspectives of human decision-making and social interaction, and for incorporating such behavior systematically in a dynamic computational model suitable for emergency egress analysis.

AB  - The criterion fuzzy concept refers to a fuzzy set that represents the decision-maker's subjective preference for each criterion within the universe of criteria. Addressing the challenge of ranking all alternatives based on a given criterion fuzzy concept is a novel research direction in the field of fuzzy multi-criteria ranking issues. This paper proposes a three-phase approach for multi-criteria ranking in fuzzy environments, which combines the criterion fuzzy concept and three-way decision thinking. The proposed approach not only analyzes the decision-making characteristics of all alternatives but also facilitates their ranking. During the first phase, a qualitative classification method based on the criterion fuzzy concept and ideal solutions is defined, which divides all alternatives into three independent decision sub-regions. During the second phase, by analyzing the priority relationships among the alternatives within every sub-region, three local ranking rules for alternatives are proposed to determine the ranking of alternatives in each classification region. During the third phase, the semantic relations among three classification regions are considered to give an overall ranking of all alternatives. Finally, combined with two existing quantitative ranking indicators, multiple data sets are employed to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed three-phase multi-criteria ranking approach.

AB  - 2-amino-N-cyclopropyl-5-ethylthiophene-3-carboxamide (ACPETC) (C10H14N2OS) has been synthesized, characterized via single-crystal X-ray diffraction at 296 K and studied theoretically via DFT approach. The compound crystallizes in tetragonal crystal system, space group I-4 with Z = 8 and the following unit cell dimensions: a = 16.0892(4) Å, b = 16.0892(4) Å, c = 8.4059(2) Å. ACPETC was experimentally characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, FT-IR, UV–Vis and ESI-MS analysis. The molecular structure, vibrational spectra, MEP, ELF, NLO, NBO, NHO, and FMO analysis of ACPETC (C10H14N2OS) in the ground state were estimated using HF, MP2, DFT/B3LYP using the 6–311++G(d,p) basis set. Computed NMR chemical shifts (1H and 13C), as well as discrete regions in IR active vibrations, are in good concurrence with their experimental counterparts. FT-IR spectra of ACPETC were obtained in the ranges of 4000−450 cm−1. The UV–vis spectrum as well as the effects of solvents has been studied. The estimated HOMO and LUMO energies reveal that charge transfer happens within the molecule and MEP surface to be a chemically reactive region suitable for drug action. The O1-atom appears to be more vulnerable to electrophilic assault. The NBO analysis was also performed. It indicates that the greatest second order perturbation energy E(2) = 50.11 kcal/mol associated with electron delocalization from the donor (N15) → π* (C10-O14) acceptor interaction. On the atomic charges of the title chemical, the Fukui function and Mulliken analysis have been calculated. 3-D and 2-D interactions in crystals were studies and Hirshfeld surface analysis was used. To discover the optimum ligand-protein interactions, molecular docking was used using eight protein receptors.

AB  - Background
Physiochemical factors such as temperature, pH and cofactors are well known parameters that confer conformational changes in a protein structure. With S100β protein being a metal binding brain-specific receptor for both extracellular and intracellular functions, a change in conformation due to the above-mentioned factors, can compromise their cellular functions and therefore result in several pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Ischemic stroke, as well as Myocardial Infarction.
Objective
The studies conducted sought to elucidate the effect of these physiological factors on the conformational dynamics of S100β protein using computational modeling approaches.
Method
Temperature-dependent and protein-cofactor complexes molecular dynamics simulations were conducted by varying the temperature from 100 to 400K using GROMACS 5.0.3. Additionally, the conformational dynamics of the protein was studied by varying the pH at 5.0, 7.4 and 9.0 using Ambertools17. This was done by preparing the protein molecule, solvating and minimizing its energy level as well as heating it to the required temperature, equilibrating and simulating under desired conditions (NVT and NPT ensembles).
Results
The results show that the protein misfolds as a function of increasing temperature with alpha helical content at 100K and 400K being 57.8% and 43.3%, respectively. However, the binding sites of the protein were not appreciably affected by temperature variations. The protein displayed high conformational instability in acidic medium (pH ~5.0). The binding sites of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ were identified and each exhibited different groupings of the secondary structural elements (binding motifs). The secondary structure analysis revealed different conformational changes with the characteristic appearance of two beta hairpins in the presence of Zn2+and Mg2+.
Conclusion
High temperatures, different cofactors and acidic pH confer conformational changes to the S100β structure and these results may indicate the design of novel drugs against the protein.

Crucially, its impact is already extending beyond automation of routine tasks and encroaching on creativity – a domain once seen as exclusively human. Hence, this article first surveys the discriminatory and exploitative underpinnings of the anthropocentric thinking that lies beyond attempts at sidelining the creative capacities of AI. Next, four different approaches to creativity and art are analyzed, ultimately conceptualizing art-ness as externally ascribed. Ultimately, the article moves to one way of such ascription – copyrightability – demonstrating the anthropocentric thinking behind attempts to both deny and award copyright protection to AI-generated content. Moreover, it transpires that human authors are under threat whichever of such strategies ends up dominant.

The current pre-registered experiments with children ages 7 to 11 years investigated the developmental foundations of this ability through a novel social reasoning paradigm and a computational approach. In the inference task, children were asked to figure out what happened based on whether two speakers agreed or disagreed in their interpretation. In the prediction task, children were provided information about what happened and asked to predict whether two speakers will agree or disagree. Together, these experiments assessed children's understanding that disagreement often results from ambiguity about what happened, and that ambiguity about what happened is often predictive of disagreement. Experiment 1 (N = 52) showed that children are more likely to infer that an ambiguous utterance occurred after learning that people disagreed (versus agreed) about what happened and found that these inferences become stronger with age. Experiment 2 (N = 110) similarly found age-related change in children's inferences and also showed that children could reason in the forward direction, predicting that an ambiguous utterance would lead to disagreement. A computational model indicated that although children's ability to predict when disagreements might arise may be critical for making the reverse inferences, it did not fully account for age-related change.

AB  - Dealing with students' attitudinal problems related to statistics is an important aspect of statistics instruction. Employing the appropriate learning strategies may have a relationship with anxiety during the process of statistics learning. Thus, the present study investigated multivariate relationships between self-regulated learning strategies and statistical anxiety using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Three hundred twenty Turkish college students responded to the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and the Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale. Of the group, 189 (59.1%) were women and 131 (40.9%) were men. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 33years with a mean of 21.28years (SD=1.53). Bivariate correlation coefficients showed significant relationships between the dimensions of learning strategies and statistical anxiety. CCA showed that students who used more rehearsal, elaboration, organization, critical thinking, metacognitive regulation, time and study environment management, and effort regulation strategies experienced lower computational anxiety and had more positive attitudes toward statistics. Additionally, a combination of effort regulation and help seeking strategies is associated with test/class anxiety.

AB  - The capacity for active thought is arguably one of humanity's defining features. The frontal lobes are critically involved in active thinking. In this article we will consider what can be learned from the effects of frontal lobe lesions about: (1) the relationship between active thought and intelligence, (2) whether active thought can occur without language, and (3) the processes involved in active thinking. The evidence reviewed reveals that different forms of active thought and their essential pre-requisites can be fractionated and appear to be underpinned by different frontal areas. Hence, active thinking may be achieved by distinct, interacting cognitive processes.

AB  - In this paper a computational model is presented for how a desire triggers responses and feelings. The model shows how these feelings can be biased, for example due to addicting experiences in the past. Both the strength of a response and of the associated feeling result from a converging dynamic pattern modeled by reciprocal causal interactions between the two. The model has been used to conduct a number of simulation experiments under varying circumstances. Moreover, it has been evaluated by formal analysis of emerging patterns entailed by the model. Furthermore, it has been pointed out how the computational model can be applied within an ambient agent system supporting a human in not being tempted. In a simple example scenario it is shown such an ambient agent system is able to predict and assess a human’s desire state, and use this assessment to suggest alternatives to avoid falling for certain temptations.

AB  - Based on results from cognitive science, this paper examines the two fields of three-way decision and granular computing, as well as their interplay. The ideas from one field shed new light on the other field. The integration of the two gives rise to three-way granular computing, that is, thinking, problem solving, and information processing in threes. We discuss a wide sense of three-way decision and propose a trisecting–acting–outcome (TAO) model. We explain fundamental notions of granular computing based on the philosophy of three-way decision as thinking in threes. We discuss a model of three-way granular computing by making use of two particular types of granular structures represented, respectively, by three granules and three levels. We use examples across different disciplines to demonstrate the values of the two types. Our investigation suggests that, in many situations, the power of granular computing is indeed the power of three-way decision, i.e., thinking in threes.

AB  - The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users’ reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users’ reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly.

AB  - We feel that we perceive events in the environment as they unfold in real-time. However, this intuitive view of perception is impossible to implement in the nervous system due to biological constraints such as neural transmission delays. I propose a new way of thinking about real-time perception: at any given moment, instead of representing a single timepoint, perceptual mechanisms represent an entire timeline. On this timeline, predictive mechanisms predict ahead to compensate for delays in incoming sensory input, and reconstruction mechanisms retroactively revise perception when those predictions do not come true. This proposal integrates and extends previous work to address a crucial gap in our understanding of a fundamental aspect of our everyday life: the experience of perceiving the present.

AB  - Summary
The supplementary motor area (SMA) is believed to contribute to higher order aspects of motor control. We considered a key higher order role: tracking progress throughout an action. We propose that doing so requires population activity to display low "trajectory divergence": situations with different future motor outputs should be distinct, even when present motor output is identical. We examined neural activity in SMA and primary motor cortex (M1) as monkeys cycled various distances through a virtual environment. SMA exhibited multiple response features that were absent in M1. At the single-neuron level, these included ramping firing rates and cycle-specific responses. At the population level, they included a helical population-trajectory geometry with shifts in the occupied subspace as movement unfolded. These diverse features all served to reduce trajectory divergence, which was much lower in SMA versus M1. Analogous population-trajectory geometry, also with low divergence, naturally arose in networks trained to internally guide multi-cycle movement.

AB  - Time perception and inferences there from are of critical importance to many autonomous agents. But time is not perceived directly by any sensory organ. We argue that time is constructed by cognitive processes. Here we present a model for time perception that concentrates on succession and duration, and that generates these concepts and others, such as continuity, immediate present duration, and lengths of time. These concepts are grounded through the perceptual process itself. We also address event representation, event hierarchy and expectations, as issues intimately related with time. The LIDA cognitive model is used to illustrate these ideas.

AB  - This chapter discusses biological perspectives on creativity. Some of the research on creativity as of late involves the brain and biological correlates of originality, novelty, and insight. Handedness has long been used as an indication of hemispheric dominance or hemisphericity, with right-handed people being compared with left-handed people. There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed ones in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have more recently been studied with electroencephalogram (EEG), positron emission topography (PET), cerebral blood flow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem-solving or at least with specific phases within the problem-solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on tasks indicative of creative potential. Much of the complexity disappears when those same individuals work on convergent thinking tasks. Research suggests that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in creative thinking and behaviour.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate how diversification of the repertoire of digital design techniques affects the creative behaviors of designers in the early design phases. The principal results of practice-based pilot experiments on the subject indicate three key properties of the hybrid digital tooling strategy. The strategy features intelligent human-machine integration, facilitating three different types of synergies between the designer and the digital media: human-dominated, machine-dominated, and a balanced human-machine collaboration. This strategy also boosts the cognitive behaviors of the designer by triggering divergent, transformative and convergent design activities and allowing for work on various abstraction levels. In addition, the strategy stimulates the explorative behaviors of the designer by encouraging the production of and interaction with a wide range of design representations, including physical and digital, dynamic and static objects. Thus, working with a broader range of digital modeling techniques can positively influence the creativity of designers in the early conception stages.

AB  - Clinically defined psychosis diagnoses are neurobiologically heterogeneous. The B-SNIP consortium identified and validated more neurobiologically homogeneous psychosis Biotypes using an extensive battery of neurocognitive and psychophysiological laboratory measures. However, typically the first step in any diagnostic evaluation is the clinical interview. In this project, we evaluated if psychosis Biotypes have clinical characteristics that can support their differentiation in addition to obtaining laboratory testing. Clinical interview data from 1907 individuals with a psychosis Biotype were used to create a diagnostic algorithm. The features were 58 ratings from standard clinical scales. Extremely randomized tree algorithms were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification success. Biotype classification accuracy peaked at 91 % with the use of 57 items on average. A reduced feature set of 28 items, though, also showed 81 % classification accuracy. Using this reduced item set, we found that only 10–11 items achieved a one-vs-all (Biotype-1 or not, Biotype-2 or not, Biotype-3 or not) area under the sensitivity-specificity curve of .78 to .81. The top clinical characteristics for differentiating psychosis Biotypes, in order of importance, were (i) difficulty in abstract thinking, (ii) multiple indicators of social functioning, (iii) conceptual disorganization, (iv) severity of hallucinations, (v) stereotyped thinking, (vi) suspiciousness, (vii) unusual thought content, (viii) lack of spontaneous speech, and (ix) severity of delusions. These features were remarkably different from those that differentiated DSM psychosis diagnoses. This low-burden adaptive algorithm achieved reasonable classification accuracy and will support Biotype-specific etiological and treatment investigations even in under-resourced clinical and research environments.

AB  - This article is a reply to Foss et al.’s (2022) contribution to the special issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Management on The Great Reset of management and organization theory. In their article, the authors make a strong case that “reset thinking” geared towards a more “sustainable” redesign of the global economy promotes extensive state interventionism and cronyism capitalism, and therefore reject the idea of a need for “a fundamental rethink of existing management theory”. Whereas I do agree with the authors on most points, I am less convinced that “existing management theory” will suffice to address the problem of “reset thinking”. In this article, I demonstrate that the economy-bias of existing theories is a gateway for “reset thinking” geared towards an allegedly necessary re-/socialisation of management and organisation. A research agenda on cronyism must therefore be complemented by one on privilege and hierarchy not only as undesirable side-effects of cronyism, but also as desired outcomes of advocacy for specific minorities or missions. As self-identifications with group interests or calls for missions have become popular in management theory, I conclude that this new appetite for privilege might undermine not only the higher ideals of many management theorists, but also the foundations of modern society.

AB  - The formation of stall cells over a NACA 0012 airfoil at a Reynolds number of one million has been investigated numerically, using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) and delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES) approaches. The simulations are performed with a very wide computational domain (10 chord length) to minimize the influence of spanwise periodic boundary conditions. For the URANS simulations, four different spanwise mesh resolutions are tested to determine the minimum resolution required to capture the formation of stall cells. Both URANS and DDES results show a sudden decrease in lift and increase in drag between 16° and 17° angle of attack, accompanied by a significant change of separated flow patterns. Stall cell structures are observed clearly in the URANS solutions between 17° and 19° with a spanwise spacing of about 1.4 to 1.8 chord length, which agrees well with a theoretical prediction based on the slope of the lift curve in this angle-of-attack range. The DDES results show much more complex flow patterns over the airfoil at these high angles of attack, although the spectral analysis of wall shear stress suggests the existence of flow structures having a similar spanwise length scale to the stall cells.

AB  - Judgment and decision-making paradigms have been relatively well-studied in developmental samples. The measurement of these competencies in developmental samples has been of scientific interest. They have been recognized as having important implications for defining rational thinking in children and youth but also for teaching and training (such as, critical thinking in education). The origin of the theories and paradigms come from the adult literature, which has also undergone considerable progress in theoretical advancements and empirical studies over the last several years. The integration of our understanding from the work conducted in adults with consideration of developmental factors provides a way to advance our understanding of judgment and decision-making in children and youth. To accomplish this, establishing stimulus equivalence will be important given that these paradigms were first designed for adult samples. In addition, taking into account the rapid growth and change in cognitive capacities, that happen in development, are central for understanding performance on these paradigms. Using a working taxonomy of rational thinking based on adult samples, data from a longitudinal developmental study were used to empirically examine performance patterns on these paradigms.

Under the practical hypothesis of single physical failures in the network, the backup paths which protect against different logical failure risks (node, link and shared risk link group (SRLG)) cannot be active at the same time. Thus, sharing bandwidth between such backup paths is crucial to increase the bandwidth availability. In this article, we focus on the optimal on-line distributed computation of the bandwidth-guaranteed backup paths in MPLS networks. As the requests for connection establishment and release arrive dynamically without knowledge of future arrivals, we choose to use the on-line mode to avoid LSP reconfigurations. We also selected a distributed computation to offer scalability and decrease the LSP setup time. Finally, the optimization of bandwidth utilization can be achieved thanks to the flexibility of the path choice offered by MPLS and to the bandwidth sharing. For a good bandwidth sharing, the backup path computation entities (BPCEs) require the knowledge and maintenance of a great quantity of bandwidth information (e.g. non aggregated link information or per path information) which is undesirable in distributed environments. To get around this problem, we propose here a PLR (point of local repair)-based heuristic (PLRH) which aggregates and noticeably decreases the size of the bandwidth information advertised in the network while offering a high bandwidth sharing. PLRH permits an efficient computation of backup paths. It is scalable, easy to be deployed and balances equitably computations on the network nodes. Simulations show that with the transmission of a small quantity of aggregated information per link, the ratio of rejected backup paths is low and close to the optimum.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Conditions are typified by a divergence in cognitive style from that of the non-autistic population. Cognitive differences in autism may underlie significant strengths, but also increase vulnerability to psychopathology such as anxiety, which is a major problem for many autistic people. Many autistic people also do not respond to typical psychotherapeutic interventions, suggesting that autism-specific models and interventions are needed. We advance a theoretical model explaining how three constructs, attenuated predictions, intolerance of uncertainty, and ‘black and white thinking’, may interact to lead to anxiety in autism. We hope to start a dialogue surrounding how we can best address specific autistic cognitive differences that may lead to distress by developing appropriate models, measurements, and psychotherapeutic interventions.

AB  - A two-dimensional numerical study was performed to investigate the acoustic effects of micro-tab device on airframe noise reduction. As the noise generated by leading-edge slat and trailing-edge flap rise with their increased deflection angles, it is possible to mitigate such high-lift noise by using reduced settings without sacrificing the aerodynamic performance during approach. In this paper, micro-tab device attached to the pressure side of the flap surface is envisioned as a mean to achieve this goal. Hybrid method involving Computational Fluid Dynamics and acoustic analogy was used to predict the far-field noise spectrum. Results illustrate that the micro-tab device with reduced deflection angles of the high-lift settings provides lower noise signature at far-field positions, comparing to the baseline configuration, while the aerodynamic performance is maintained. In addition, two parametric studies which investigated the effects of micro-tab location and micro-tab height on acoustic spectra were also included.

AB  - Following the suggestion that midbrain dopaminergic neurons encode a signal, known as a ‘reward prediction error’, used by artificial intelligence algorithms for learning to choose advantageous actions, the study of the neural substrates for reward-based learning has been strongly influenced by computational theories. In recent work, such theories have been increasingly integrated into experimental design and analysis. Such hybrid approaches have offered detailed new insights into the function of a number of brain areas, especially the cortex and basal ganglia. In part this is because these approaches enable the study of neural correlates of subjective factors (such as a participant's beliefs about the reward to be received for performing some action) that the computational theories purport to quantify.

AB  - The complicated micro structures, macro emergences and dynamic evolutions in a supply chain network pose challenges to decision making for solving operational problems for the network's performance improvement. Most of these problems are complicated since various factors and their complicated relationships are involved. Success of this decision making relies on efficient business analytics based on the comprehensive and multi-dimensional data related to the static attributes and dynamic operations of the network. To confront the challenges, this paper proposes to explore a methodology of data-driven decision making for supply chain networks. In this methodology, a data-granularity model of a supply chain network is developed to standardize the data form for decision making. A four-dimensional-flow model of a supply chain network is proposed to satisfy the data requirements for decision making that are defined in the data-granularity model. Agent-based computational experiment is employed to support the generation of a comprehensive operational dataset of a supply chain network and to verify the solutions generated in decision making. Integrating these models, a data-driven decision-making framework for supply chain networks is proposed. In the framework, a new decision-making mode of “problem definition - business analytics - solution verification - parameter adjustment” is proposed. Oriented towards domain knowledge in supply chain networks, two approaches of business analytics—mapping analysis and correlation analysis—are presented. Finally, a case of a five-echelon manufacturing supply chain network is studied with the methodology. The findings indicate that the proposed methodology, models and framework are effective in supporting the data-centric decision making for solving complicated operational problems in supply chain networks and provide the networks’ managers or member enterprises with an effective tool to generate unbiased and efficient decisions for the networks’ performance improvement.

AB  - The storage capacity and the computation time of dynamic analysis for seismic responses of high concrete arch dam systems are enormous. As a matter of course, the use of high-performance parallel computation for seismic analysis of high-concrete dams must be enforced. The significance and current situation of parallel computation for hydraulic structures using finite element method are briefly described. However, the more difficult task is to develop a parallel program. The EFPG is a finite element program generator using finite element language developed by Chinese Professor Liang Guoping in 1990. The program generated by FEPG can be automatically transformed to corresponding parallel program through the program PFEPG. The parallel computational program by means of FEPG and PFEPG applied in this stage to dynamic analysis for seismic responses of high concrete arch dam system is outlined. The strategy of FEPG is based on component technique and the technique of automatically generating programs. According to the characteristics of domain decomposition method, a finite element program can generally be decomposed to six modules as preprocess partition, start, bft, solv, E, and U programs, in which the subroutines of E and U component are generated by the system based on the scripts VDE or PDE of the partial differential equation describing the physical fields and the corresponding computational algorithms (NFE), other else components are fixed and provided by the FEPG Library. The structures and modules as well as the working operation of FEPG and PFEPG are briefly introduced. The parallel program developed for seismic response analysis of high arch dam by using the FEPG and PFEPG, including the corresponding treatments of dynamic explicit computation process, dynamic contact problem, artificial transmitting, and spring-viscous boundaries, are examined in slight details. The procedure of seismic analysis of arch dam includes three loading cases accomplished successively as follows:1.In case 1, the dam elements were treated as dead elements with zero degree of freedom for nodes, and only the dead load of the foundation rock is considered in the analysis. At the end of calculation, the initial normal compressive force along the contact planes was modified by adding the calculated contact force. All other states of the foundation were recovered to that before loading.2.In case 2, the dead load of dam and other static actions including water pressure, silt pressure, and temperature applied to the dam as well as the seepage pressure in the foundation are considered.3.In case 3, a three-component seismic input is applied to the base of the artificial transmitting boundaries in form of displacement ground motion, or to the spring-viscous boundaries with free field input including boundary stresses, velocities and displacements. In this loading case, the rate effect for dynamic strength and modulus of elasticity are considered.

Starting from the extraction and identification of plant-based bioactive components, such as historical salicin or more recent paclitaxel, phytochemistry-based research now includes plant metabolomics that help delineate chemotaxonomy, phylogenetic biomarkers and the functional genetics of a plant’s response to biotic or abiotic stressors. Here, we examine the invaluable contributions of mathematical models and computation for analysing plant metabolomics data and discuss the analytics mindset, highlight best practices, provide example workflows, as well as introduce future opportunities. Important in this chapter is the application of statistical methods for the improved visualization and interpretation of plant metabolomics data and their relevance for future project planning.

AB  - A standing challenge for the science of mind is to account for the datum that every mind faces in the most immediate – that is, unmediated – fashion: its phenomenal experience. The complementary tasks of explaining what it means for a system to give rise to experience and what constitutes the content of experience (qualia) in computational terms are particularly challenging, given the multiple realizability of computation. In this paper, we identify a set of conditions that a computational theory must satisfy for it to constitute not just a sufficient but a necessary, and therefore naturalistic and intrinsic, explanation of qualia. We show that a common assumption behind many neurocomputational theories of the mind, according to which mind states can be formalized solely in terms of instantaneous vectors of activities of representational units such as neurons, does not meet the requisite conditions, in part because it relies on inactive units to shape presently experienced qualia and implies a homogeneous representation space, which is devoid of intrinsic structure. We then sketch a naturalistic computational theory of qualia, which posits that experience is realized by dynamical activity-space trajectories (rather than points) and that its richness is measured by the representational capacity of the trajectory space in which it unfolds.

AB  - Objective
Acoustic phonetic methods are useful in examining some symptoms of schizophrenia; we used such methods to understand the underpinnings of aprosody. We hypothesized that, compared to controls and patients without clinically rated aprosody, patients with aprosody would exhibit reduced variability in: pitch (F0), jaw/mouth opening and tongue height (formant F1), tongue front/back position and/or lip rounding (formant F2), and intensity/loudness.
Methods
Audiorecorded speech was obtained from 98 patients (including 25 with clinically rated aprosody and 29 without) and 102 unaffected controls using five tasks: one describing a drawing, two based on spontaneous speech elicited through a question (Tasks 2 and 3), and two based on reading prose excerpts (Tasks 4 and 5). We compared groups on variation in pitch (F0), formant F1 and F2, and intensity/loudness.
Results
Regarding pitch variation, patients with aprosody differed significantly from controls in Task 5 in both unadjusted tests and those adjusted for sociodemographics. For the standard deviation (SD) of F1, no significant differences were found in adjusted tests. Regarding SD of F2, patients with aprosody had lower values than controls in Task 3, 4, and 5. For variation in intensity/loudness, patients with aprosody had lower values than patients without aprosody and controls across the five tasks.
Conclusions
Findings could represent a step toward developing new methods for measuring and tracking the severity of this specific negative symptom using acoustic phonetic parameters; such work is relevant to other psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Each encounter with the student is analyzed in two ways, first analyzing his mathematical knowledge, and then analyzing obstacles the student faces that are associated with ASD. Some obstacles are overcome by the student on his own and others are overcome with the help of the researcher, who responds to the student’s thinking, and supports his endeavor to engage with a challenging activity.

AB  - Process Systems Engineering (PSE) is a discipline that deals with decision-making, at all levels and scales, by understanding any complex process system using a holistic view and a systems thinking framework. A closely related discipline (considered usually a part of PSE) is the Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) which is a complementary field that focuses on developing methods and providing solution through systematic computer aided techniques for problems related to the design, control and operation of chemical systems. Nowadays, the ‘PSE’ term suffers from a branding issue to the point that PSE no longer gets the recognition that it deserves. In chemical engineering education the integrative systems frame for process design, control and operations is virtually absent. Its application potential in process industry lags relative to academic research progress and results. This work aims to provide an informative industrial and academic perspective on PSE (focused on the European region), arguing that the ‘systems thinking’ and ‘systems problem solving’ have to be given priority over just applications of computational problem solving methods. A multi-level view of the PSE field is provided within the academic and industrial context, and enhancements for PSE are suggested at their industrial and academic interfaces to create win-win situations.

AB  - The generation of alternative policies is essential in complex decision tasks with multiple interests and stakeholders. A diverse set of policies is typically desirable to cover the range of options and objectives. Decision modelling literature has often assumed that clearly defined decision alternatives are readily available. This is not a realistic assumption in practice. We present a structured process model for the generation of policy alternatives in settings that include non-quantifiable elements and where portfolio optimisation approaches are not applicable. Behavioural issues and path dependence as well as heuristics and biases which can occur during the process are discussed. The behavioural experiment compares policy alternatives obtained by using two different portfolio generation techniques. The results of the experiment demonstrate that path dependence can occur in policy generation. We report thinking patterns of subjects which relate to biases and heuristics.

A set of elaborate mathematical models is governed by partial differential equations representing conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy, alongside with theoretical and empirical correlation. Therefore, CFD simulation is a crucial asset to understand the influence of parameters of interest in these processes and related operation and optimization of the technology involved. This chapter discusses how CFD can be used advantageously over waste-to-energy processes, also outlining advantages, disadvantages, and main setbacks with such an approach.

AB  - We provide an efficient computational approach to solve the mixed integer programming (MIP) model developed by Tarim and Kingsman [8] for solving a stochastic lot-sizing problem with service level constraints under the static–dynamic uncertainty strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed method hinges on three novelties: (i) the proposed relaxation is computationally efficient and provides an optimal solution most of the time, (ii) if the relaxation produces an infeasible solution, then this solution yields a tight lower bound for the optimal cost, and (iii) it can be modified easily to obtain a feasible solution, which yields an upper bound. In case of infeasibility, the relaxation approach is implemented at each node of the search tree in a branch-and-bound procedure to efficiently search for an optimal solution. Extensive numerical tests show that our method dominates the MIP solution approach and can handle real-life size problems in trivial time.

AB  - Understanding the forces that influence natural variation within and among populations has been a major objective of evolutionary biologists for decades. Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.

This paper reports on five calculus students’ generalizing activity and what they generalized about multivariable functions. The study makes two contributions. The first is a fine-grained, actor-oriented characterization of the ways undergraduates generalized. This adds to knowledge in two areas: the use of the actor-oriented perspective and generalization in advanced mathematics. The second contribution is the products of students’ generalizing: what they generalized about what it means for a multivariable relation to represent a function). This adds to the literature about student reasoning regarding multivariable topics by characterizing the powerful ways of reasoning students possess pre-instruction.

AB  - Summary
Forming a four-component compound from the first 103 elements of the periodic table results in more than 1012 combinations. Such a materials space is intractable to high-throughput experiment or first-principle computation. We introduce a framework to address this problem and quantify how many materials can exist. We apply principles of valency and electronegativity to filter chemically implausible compositions, which reduces the inorganic quaternary space to 1010 combinations. We demonstrate that estimates of band gaps and absolute electron energies can be made simply on the basis of the chemical composition and apply this to the search for new semiconducting materials to support the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. We show the applicability to predicting crystal structure by analogy with known compounds, including exploration of the phase space for ternary combinations that form a perovskite lattice. Computer screening reproduces known perovskite materials and predicts the feasibility of thousands more. Given the simplicity of the approach, large-scale searches can be performed on a single workstation.

AB  - An increasing number of dissident voices claim that the standard neo-Darwinian view of genes as ‘leaders’ and phenotypes as ‘followers’ during the process of adaptive evolution should be turned on its head. This idea is older than the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of inheritance, with the turn-of-the-twentieth-century notion eventually labeled as the ‘Baldwin effect’ as one of the many ways in which the standard neo-Darwinian view can be turned around. A condition for this effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic plasticity or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a trait. This gives the additional time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and the adaptive trait can be eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential paper published in the late 1980s claimed the Baldwin effect to happen in computer simulations, and avowed that it was crucial to solve a difficult adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary emergence of high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language almost hopeless. Here, we use analytical and computational approaches to show that a standard population genetics treatment can easily crack what the scientific community has granted as an unsolvable adaptive problem without learning. Evolutionary psychologists and linguists have invoked the (claimed) Baldwin effect to make wild assertions that should not be taken seriously. What the Baldwin effect needs are plausible case-histories.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) make up a large proportion of transcriptome in eukaryotes, and have been revealed with many regulatory functions in various biological processes. When studying lncRNAs, the first step is to accurately and specifically distinguish them from the colossal transcriptome data with complicated composition, which contains mRNAs, lncRNAs, small RNAs and their primary transcripts. In the face of such a huge and progressively expanding transcriptome data, the in-silico approaches provide a practicable scheme for effectively and rapidly filtering out lncRNA targets, using machine learning and probability statistics. In this review, we mainly discussed the characteristics of algorithms and features on currently developed approaches. We also outlined the traits of some state-of-the-art tools for ease of operation. Finally, we pointed out the underlying challenges in lncRNA identification with the advent of new experimental data.

AB  - Previously, doctors interpreted diseases and their outcomes according to their experience in diagnosis. However, with the rapid increase in technology and population, the task of examining the patient becomes cumbersome and sometimes human efforts produce inconsistent results. Several research is being done for healthcare in terms of improving visualization and accuracy by using machine learning models. The current research targets to explore quantum computing as a different way of processing information compared to classical computer systems such as the use of quantum bits (qubits) along with superposition and entanglement for extending the computation capabilities at an unprecedented level of thinking in the healthcare domain. Quantum computing systems provide exponential benefits in terms of high-speed processing, faster and easier diagnostic assistance, unimaginable reduction in processing throughput, and many more. An extensive comparative analysis of existing approaches has been made which benchmarks the need for quantum healthcare computing. The objective of this work is to interpret whether Quantum computers prove to be more trusted when it comes to patient diagnosis, and faster analysis leading to cost optimization. In order to accelerate patient diagnosis, different approaches have been presented. The authors have proposed a precision-based granular approach for patient diagnosis that incorporates diagnosing the disease with enhanced precision and granularity. It involves reporting symptoms by the patient, encountering by healthcare expert on multiple factors, precise examination, granular health status (understanding past and present medical history), followed by a precise intervention by understanding biomolecular simulations. The algorithm has been presented to describe the flow process for patient diagnosis modeling using quantum computing. It involves qubits initialization, pairing the values, assigning probabilistic values, cross-validation, and quantum circuit formation. Precision-based granular approach has been implemented for a scenario (consisting of medical parameters such as oxygen and heart rate level, with the functionality of diagnosing oxygen level and heart range which lies as either normal or not normal (high/low)). Precision-based granular approach deals specifically with the individual ‘biomolecular simulation by understanding variations in the individual body whereas the umbrella-based approach does not deal with specifically to individual mechanisms. Granular level of encounter is not possible in umbrella-based treatment. Python Jupyter notebook and IBM Composer tool is used for the implementation of results. Bloch sphere and computational state graph are obtained as an output for better visualization and understanding. Falcon r5.11H processor is used with the version of 1.0.24 of IBM Composer to simulate the experiment. The methodology using precision based granular approach provides timely encounter of disease along with umbrella diagnosis and precise treatment. The time is taken and frequency of qubits have been presented with promising results. The diagnosis process and optimizing cost efficiency can aid in an early detection of the disease.

AB  - Effective treatment choices to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited because of the absence of effective target-based therapeutics. The main object of the current research was to estimate the antiviral activity of cannabinoids (CBDs) against the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the presented research work, we performed in silico and in vitro experiments to aid the sighting of lead CBDs for treating the viral infections of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening was carried out for interactions between 32 CBDs and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Afterward, in vitro antiviral activity was carried out of five CBDs molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (IC50 = 10.25 μM) and cannabidiol (IC50 = 7.91 μM) were observed to be more potent antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, and remdesivir (IC50 ranges of 8.16–13.15 μM). These molecules were found to have stable conformations with the active binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory. Our findings suggest cannabidiol and Δ9 -tetrahydrocannabinol are possible drugs against human coronavirus that might be used in combination or with other drug molecules to treat COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Polypharmacology-based strategies are gaining increased attention as a novel approach to obtaining potentially innovative medicines for multifactorial diseases. However, some within the pharmaceutical community have resisted these strategies because they can be resource-hungry in the early stages of the drug discovery process. Here, we report on fragment-based and computational methods that might accelerate and optimize the discovery of multitarget drugs. In particular, we illustrate that fragment-based approaches can be particularly suited for polypharmacology, owing to the inherent promiscuous nature of fragments. In parallel, we explain how computer-assisted protocols can provide invaluable insights into how to unveil compounds theoretically able to bind to more than one protein. Furthermore, several pragmatic aspects related to the use of these approaches are covered, thus offering the reader practical insights on multitarget-oriented drug discovery projects.

AB  - The primate brain has evolved specialized visual capacities to navigate complex physical and social environments. Researchers studying cortical circuits underlying these capacities have traditionally favored the use of simplified tasks and brief stimulus presentations in order to isolate cognitive variables with tight experimental control. As a result, operational theories about visual brain function have come to emphasize feature detection, hierarchical stimulus encoding, top-down task modulation, and functional segregation in distinct cortical areas. Recently, however, experimental paradigms combining natural behavior with electrophysiological recordings have begun to offer a distinctly different portrait of how the brain takes in and analyzes its visual surroundings. The present article reviews recent work in this area, highlighting some of the more surprising findings in domains of social vision and spatial navigation along with shifts in thinking that have begun to emanate from this approach.

AB  - Developing students’ creative thinking abilities while learning mathematics has been recently emphasized by many scholars, with many nations including creative thinking in mathematics as one of their overarching curriculum goals. The first purpose of the present study is to develop a framework to identify what type of mathematical tasks promote the mathematical creativity of students. The second purpose is to analyze to what degree the most commonly used three middle school curricula (i.e., Eureka, The Go Math!, and CPM) in the U.S. include creativity-directed tasks in their textbooks using this framework. Analyzing 1,500 mathematical tasks in each curriculum revealed that different curricula emphasize different dimensions of the creativity-directed tasks categories (i.e., open-ended tasks, problem-posing, connections, extensions, visualizations, and communication) presented in the framework. The result also revealed that open-ended problems are more common in the 6th grade textbooks than 7th and 8th grade textbooks regardless of the three selected middle school mathematics curricula. The implication of this study is to guide teachers with the strength and weakness of textbooks in terms of their inclusiveness of creativity-directed tasks to inform their teaching. Additionally, it is critical for curriculum developers to pay particular attention in including tasks that supporting each category and subcategory proportionately across the three years of middle school rather than emphasizing a few of them in one grade and almost completely ignoring them in previous or later years.

Furthermore, AI possesses the potential to emulate critical thinking, reasoning, problem-solving abilities, and logical capacities of machines. Additionally, in the realm of gut microbiota research, AI emerges as a valuable asset. The synergy between gut microbes and AI not only holds promise for treating diverse gastroenterological diseases but also aids in comprehending the intricate relationships between gut microbes and microbes of resides into the other body parts. Moreover, AI facilitates a deeper understanding of different facets within gut-microbes interaction research. These direct communications are governed by chemical messengers, hormones, and neurotransmitters, detectable through biosensor chips employing machine learning (ML). Additionally, the indirect regulation of gut function by the brain via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can be analysed using different computational models. This promising prospect remains largely unexplored, and in this chapter, our aim is to delve into and harness the potential of AI in gut microbial research.

In this paper, modes from the second assignment are discussed in detail. Second assignment was administered with the support of graphical representations through an interactive web-module. Additionally, for comparison purposes, we briefly talk about the modes from the first assignment. First assignment was administered with the support of computational devices such as calculators providing the row reduced echelon form (rref) of matrices. Sierpinska’s framework on thinking modes (2000) was considered while qualitatively documenting the aspects of 45 matrix algebra students’ modes of reasoning. Our analysis revealed 17 categories of the modes of reasoning for the second assignment, and 15 categories for the first assignment. In conclusion, the findings of our analysis support the view of the geometric representations not replacing one’s arithmetic or algebraic modes but encouraging students to utilize multiple modes in their reasoning. Specifically, geometric representations in the presence of algebraic and arithmetic modes appear to help learners begin to consider the diverse representational aspects of a concept flexibly.

This triangulation study was conducted with 32 primary school students. The quantitative part of the study was conducted in pre-test/post-test comparison design of quasi-experimental design. The scores of reflective problem solving skills were gathered through the reflective thinking skill scale towards problem solving and the students’ performances in the code-org site were examined. In the qualitative part of the research, after the five-week experimental process, focus group interviews were conducted with ten students and a reflection paper from the IT teacher was analysed. According to the t-test results, teaching programming to primary school students in the code.org site did not cause any differences in reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. However, there is a slight increment in the means of female students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. On the other hand, qualitative data provided more information about the students’ experiences. Students developed a positive attitude towards programming, and female students showed that they were as successful as their male counterparts, and that programming could be part of their future plans.

This study investigated whether the difficulty might be due to a lack of adequate exposure to domain-specific knowledge. Students in the experimental groups in three age groups — preadolescence, middle adolescence and later adolescence — received concrete scaffolds designed to foster domain-specific knowledge of the symbolic process. A comparison of the experimental and control groups showed that students at all three ages who had experienced the scaffolds demonstrated significantly greater symbolic interpretation. Furthermore, despite concerns that the scaffolds might dampen the readers' personal response, the experimental groups at all three ages provided significantly higher enjoyment ratings of the test poems.

The collection and analysis of data for intelligence purposes is vital to national security. There are a number of hurdles including the exponentially increasing volume of available data, the need for increased cooperation between national and international agencies due to the increasingly globalized nature of threats to citizens and nations, and the need to be flexible in identifying new threats. Increasing reliance on computers is necessary, but complications arise due to such issues as incompatible data formats, multiple natural languages, and data privacy concerns. However, a potential solution to solving some of these problems for national security and law enforcement agencies is C2LG (Command and Control Lexical Grammar), which was originally developed for use within NATO, and is being adapted for use in crisis management and the fight against international organized crime.

AB  - In creative problem solving, humans perform object replacement and object composition to improvise tools in order to carry out tasks in everyday situations. In this paper, an approach to perform Object Replacement and Object Composition (OROC) inside a Creative Cognitive framework (CreaCogs) is proposed. Multi-feature correspondence is used to define similarity between objects in an everyday object domain. This enables the cognitive system OROC to perform creative replacement of objects and creative object composition. The generative properties of OROC are analysed and proof-of-concept experiments with OROC are reported. An evaluation of the results is carried out by human judges and compared to human performance in the Alternative Uses Test.

AB  - Recently, the Brazilian Ministry of Education issued New Curriculum Guidelines for engineering programs. This paper encompasses a pedagogical intervention reflecting our efforts to incorporate these new guidelines into our engineering program. Specifically, this work has led to the competency-based rework of the following subjects offered in the Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Program at the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp): I) Modeling and Systems Analysis; II) Synthesis and Optimization of Chemical Processes; III) Chemical Process Simulation; IV) Process Analysis and Control; V) Chemical Process Design; and VI) Chemical Installations Design. Thirteen transdisciplinary competencies are integrated throughout the six subjects. Students highlighted design thinking, lifelong knowledge/learning, openness to act autonomously, teamwork, communication, and cooperation as essential qualities. Moreover, the greater focus on the process systems engineering approach involving the analysis, synthesis, design, and control of sustainable processes helps chemical engineers to face new challenges using renewable resources.

AB  - Novel computational methods such as artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and genetic programming are used in this chapter for the modeling of the nonlinear behavior of composite laminates subjected to constant amplitude loading. The examined computational methods are stochastic nonlinear regression tools, and can therefore be used to model the fatigue behavior of any material, provided that sufficient data are available for training. They are material independent methods that simply follow the trend of the available data, in each case giving the best estimate of their behavior. Application on a wide range of experimental data gathered after fatigue testing glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates proved that their modeling ability compares favorably with, and is to some extent superior to, other modeling techniques.

AB  - We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage these data to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially, a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged and are examined in this review. We suggest that these computational approaches should be optimally integrated within a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery.

AB  - Child welfare policy has historically emphasized the positive impact relative caregivers can have on foster children. This emphasis coupled with recent changes in the composition of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) caseload has led to interest in child-only, relative caregiver cases. Child-only research, however, ignores cases in which the relative caregiver is also receiving benefits. Using the universe of welfare cases in Maryland in October 2005, this article compares and contrasts the demographic and case characteristics of parental and relative caregiver cases, also analyzing differences between cases with and without an adult receiving benefits. Findings indicate that relative caregivers have service needs that differ from those of parents and that recipient relative caregivers are more disadvantaged than child-only cases.

AB  - Emotion regulation, or the ability to regulate one’s own and other people’s emotions, is an important skill for human beings, enabling them to function adequately in their social environment. The development of computational models of emotion regulation opens up a range of interesting applications in human–computer interaction, varying from virtual characters to simulation-based training systems. To provide more insight in the underlying mechanisms as well as the application areas of computational emotion regulation models, the current chapter provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in this area. After briefly reviewing the psychological literature on emotion generation and regulation, I will explain how these phenomena can be formalized into computational models. Next, a computational model of emotion regulation is presented in detail, and a number of resulting simulation runs are shown. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential applications of such models.

AB  - In microgrids, residential customers play a significant part in the operation. An alternative to client administration should be to utilize smart houses to deal with demand and implement demand responsiveness measures. A power generation and electricity storage device (PGESD) for next-generation technologies is proposed in this article. The current research provides an intelligent home load control system that promotes reaction to demand thinking about this circumstance. The technology is adapted to scenarios where users can charge fluctuating electric power and transmit microgeneration devices. The suggested system utilizes deep learning technology and a fuzzy logic model for better computation and lesser complexity. The choice process involves monitoring environmental information, power production, and battery storage. This article proposes a next-generation power generation and electricity storage device (PGESD). To create Smart Buildings and Microgrids, the proposed system employs technologies and techniques that have become increasingly important. With a precision and accuracy ratio of 89% and 92%, respectively, the proposed PGESD method yields precise numerical results.

While there are legitimate concerns regarding expansion of AI models like ChatGPT in society, a better approach would be to forge a partnership between academia and industry, and utilize infrastructure of campuses to authenticate users and oversee new AI research. The public could also be involved with public libraries authenticating users. This staged approach to embedding AI in society would facilitate addressing ethical concerns, and implementing virtual AI agents in society in a responsible and safe manner.

Creativity is a highly valued and beneficial skill that empirical research typically probes using “divergent thinking” (DT) tasks such as problem solving and novel idea generation. Here, in contrast, we examine the perceptual aspect of creativity by asking whether creative individuals are more likely to perceive recognizable forms in ambiguous stimuli –a phenomenon known as pareidolia. To this end, we designed a visual task in which participants were asked to identify as many recognizable forms as possible in cloud-like fractal images. We found that pareidolic perceptions arise more often and more rapidly in highly creative individuals. Furthermore, high-creatives report pareidolia across a broader range of image contrasts and fractal dimensions than do low creatives. These results extend the established body of work on DT by introducing divergent perception as a complementary manifestation of the creative mind, thus clarifying the perception-creation link while opening new paths for studying creative behavior in humans.

AB  - Application of artificial intelligence in the accurate prediction of the rate of penetration (ROP), an important measure of drilling performance, has lately gained significant interest in oil and gas well drilling operations. Consequently, several computational intelligence techniques (CITs) for the prediction of ROP have been explored in the literature. This study explores the predictive capabilities of four commonly used CITs in the prediction of ROP and experimentally compare their predictive performance. The CIT algorithm utilizes predictors which are easily accessible continuous drilling data that have physical but complex relationship with ROP based on hydro-mechanical specific energy ROP model. The four CITs compared are the artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine, support vector Regression and least-square support vector regression (LS-SVR). Two experiments were carried out; the first experiment investigates the comparative performance of the CITs while the second investigates the effect of reduced number of predictors on the performance of the models. The results show that all the CITs perform within acceptable accuracy with testing root mean square error range (RMSE) of 18.27–28.84 and testing correlation coefficient (CC) range of 0.71–0.94. LS-SVR has the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy with RMSE of 18.27 and CC of 0.94 while ANN has the best testing execution time at 0.03 s. Also utilizing the specific energy concept in chosen drilling parameters to be included among the predictors shows improved performance with five drilling parameters showing an improvement of 3%–9% in RMSE for LS-SVR in the two well studied. The utilization of the specific energy concept in the selection of the predictors in this study has demonstrated that the easily accessible drilling parameters have immense value to provide acceptable performance in the development of ROP model with CITs.

AB  - Neurofeedback training is a form of brain training in which information about a neural measure is fed back to the trainee who is instructed to increase or decrease the value of that particular measure. This paper focuses on electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in which the neural measures of interest are the brain oscillations. To date, the neural mechanisms that underlie successful neurofeedback training are still unexplained. Such an understanding would benefit researchers, funding agencies, clinicians, regulatory bodies, and insurance firms. Based on recent empirical work, an emerging theory couched firmly within computational neuroscience is proposed that advocates a critical role of the striatum in modulating EEG frequencies. The theory is implemented as a computer simulation of peak alpha upregulation, but in principle any frequency band at one or more electrode sites could be addressed. The simulation successfully learns to increase its peak alpha frequency and demonstrates the influence of threshold setting – the threshold that determines whether positive or negative feedback is provided. Analyses of the model suggest that neurofeedback can be likened to a search process that uses importance sampling to estimate the posterior probability distribution over striatal representational space, with each representation being associated with a distribution of values of the target EEG band. The model provides an important proof of concept to address pertinent methodological questions about how to understand and improve EEG neurofeedback success.

AB  - Utilizing a case study approach, this research investigates the transformation of elementary students' Maker mindsets within the context of Maker education through a lesson study cycle. The study focuses on the Maker mindsets transformation of three students with varying abilities, deliberately chosen as information-rich participants. A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives. These findings carry significant implications for educators, advocating for the implementation of customized strategies, authentic contextualization, structured methodologies, and collaborative frameworks to holistically nurture Maker mindsets evolution. Moreover, our study underscores the practicality of the LS approach in fostering collaborative development of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering Maker mindsets formation.

AB  - Wind-generated wave energy is a renewable energy source that exhibits a huge potential for sustainable growth. The design and deployment of wave energy converters at a given location require the prediction of the amount of available wave energy flux. This and other wave parameters can be estimated by means of Computational Intelligence techniques (Neural, Fuzzy, and Evolutionary Computation). This paper reviews those used in wave energy applications, both in the resource estimation and in the design and control of wave energy converters. In particular, most of the applications of Neural Computation techniques, considered here in a broad sense, focus on the prediction of a variety of wave energy parameters by means of Multilayer Perceptrons and, at a lesser extent, by Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machines. Fuzzy Computation is also applied to estimate wave parameters and control floating wave energy converter. Evolutionary Computation algorithms are used to estimate parameters and design wave energy collectors. We complete this paper with a case study that illustrates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the potential of hybridizing a Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm with an Extreme Learning Machine to tackle the problem of significant wave height reconstruction.

AB  - In this study, hydrogen storage properties of the B24N24 and Al24N24 nanocages have been computationally investigated by the DFT method whose suitability was determined with a thorough methodological analysis. This analysis includes comparison of the performances of a number of DFT functionals against the CCSD(T) method for the determination of the best DFT method that is able to accurately model H2-BN and H2-AlN systems. The ɷB97X-D, B3LYP-D2, PBEPBE-D2, BHandH methods produced results close to that of the reference CCSD(T) method. Of all methods studied, ɷB97X-D, showing the best performance, is found to be the most appropriate DFT method for H2-B24N24 and Al24N24 systems including dispersive interactions between hydrogen and the host molecule. The ɷB97X-D calculations result in that H2 molecule make the tightest adsorptive bond with Al atom in Al24N24 having an adsorption energy of −0.116 eV, by forming much more stable complex than the H2-B24N24 one. This indicates that Al24N24 has better exohedral hydrogen storage properties. The calculations also revealed that H2 molecules cannot pass through hexagonal rings of B24N24 instead they chemisorb on the cage atoms by breaking BN bond while they can pass through hexagonal rings of Al24N24 without making any damage in the Al–N bond, leading the fact that the Al–N bond is stronger than the B–N bond. Moreover, endohedral addition of H2 molecules up to three can form thermodynamically stable nH2@Al24N24 complexes while endohedral hydrogen addition to B24N24 destabilizes the complexes. Thus, the Al24N24 nanocage is not only structurally more stable than B24N24 nanocage, but also it can accommodate more hydrogen molecules, so it is better candidate for both endohedrally and exohedrally hydrogen storage compared to B24N24.

Models can help address key questions about the measurement, definition and function of proteomic networks. Here, we place these biological questions at the forefront in reviewing the computational strategies that are available to analyze proteomic networks. Recent examples illustrate how models can extract more information from proteomic data, test possible interactions between network proteins and link networks to cellular behavior. No single model can achieve all these goals, however, which is why it is critical to prioritize biological questions before specifying a particular modeling approach.

AB  - The performance evaluation of biometric systems is a crucial step when designing and evaluating such systems. The evaluation process uses the Equal Error Rate (EER) metric proposed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/IEC). The EER metric is a powerful metric which allows easily comparing and evaluating biometric systems. However, the computation time of the EER is, most of the time, very intensive. In this paper, we propose a fast method which computes an approximated value of the EER. We illustrate the benefit of the proposed method on two applications: the computing of non parametric confidence intervals and the use of genetic algorithms to compute the parameters of fusion functions. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed EER approximation method in term of computing time, and the interest of its use to reduce the learning of parameters with genetic algorithms. The proposed method opens new perspectives for the development of secure multibiometrics systems by speeding up their computation time.

AB  - This paper reviews studies of proposed creative machines applied to a prototypical creative task, i.e., the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Although one system (OROC) did simulate some aspects of human strategies for the AUT, most recent attempts have not been simulation-oriented, but rather have used Large Language Model (LLM) systems such as GPT-3 which embody extremely large connectionist networks trained on huge volumes of textual data. Studies reviewed here indicate that LLM based systems are performing on the AUT at near or somewhat above human levels in terms of scores on originality and usefulness. Moreover, similar patterns are found in the data of humans and LLM models in the AUT, such as output order effects and a negative association between originality and value or utility. However, it is concluded that GPT-3 and similar systems, despite generating novel and useful responses, do not display creativity as they lack agency and are purely algorithmic. LLM studies so far in this area have largely been exploratory and future studies should guard against possible training data contamination.

AB  - Experimental information from microscopy, structural biology, and bioinformatics may be integrated to build structural models of entire cells with molecular detail. This integrative modeling is challenging in several ways: the intrinsic complexity of biology results in models with many closely packed and heterogeneous components; the wealth of available experimental data is scattered among multiple resources and must be gathered, reconciled, and curated; and computational infrastructure is only now gaining the capability of modeling and visualizing systems of this complexity. We present recent efforts to address these challenges, both with artistic approaches to depicting the cellular mesoscale, and development and application of methods to build quantitative models.
