AB  - Introduction: Computational methods have been widely applied to toxicology across pharmaceutical, consumer product and environmental fields over the past decade. Progress in computational toxicology is now reviewed. Methods: A literature review was performed on computational models for hepatotoxicity (e.g. for drug-induced liver injury (DILI)), cardiotoxicity, renal toxicity and genotoxicity. In addition various publications have been highlighted that use machine learning methods. Several computational toxicology model datasets from past publications were used to compare Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning methods. Results: The increasing amounts of data for defined toxicology endpoints have enabled machine learning models that have been increasingly used for predictions. It is shown that across many different models Bayesian and SVM perform similarly based on cross validation data. Discussion: Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade in both model development and availability of larger scale or ‘big data’ models. The future efforts in toxicology data generation will likely provide us with hundreds of thousands of compounds that are readily accessible for machine learning models. These models will cover relevant chemistry space for pharmaceutical, consumer product and environmental applications.

AB  - The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Generative AI (GenAI), has significantly transformed the higher education landscape. Despite the opportunities GenAI offers to students, they pose significant challenges for academic integrity. Thus, it is crucial for higher education institutions (HEI) to balance the use of GenAI for enhancing the learning experience of students with its ethical and responsible use in their educational journey. The present study proposes a comprehensive academic integrity framework focusing on three key stakeholders: students, educators, and institutions. We propose eight strategies ranging from collaborative learning for students to developing a comprehensive GenAI policy for institutions in maintaining academic integrity among students in HEI. Furthermore, we identified four challenges, namely financial, strategic, operational, and cultural, in the implementing a comprehensive academic integrity framework in the GenAI era. This study offers significant insights for HEI to maintain academic integrity among students in the GenAI era.

KW  - Computational behavior biology
AB  - The last few years of the twentieth century witnessed the emerging convergence of biology and computer science and this trend has been accelerating since then. The study of animal behavior or behavior biology has been one of the major contributors for this convergence. Behavior is fascinating because it is the response of an organism to internal and external signals and it is controlled by complex interactions among nerves, the sensory and the motor systems. To some extent, behavior is similar to the output (or response) of a computer system or a network node if we consider an animal brain as a computer node. This paper is the first in a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication, with the first part focusing on animal cognition and the second part on animal communication (Ma, 2014). The present article also assumes the task of presenting a general introduction on behavior biology literature, which sets a foundation for synthesizing both parts of the series but the synthesis will be performed in the second part of the series. I sets three objectives in this ‘cognition’ part: (i) to present a brief overview on the literature of behavior biology for computer scientists; (ii) to summarize the state-of-the-art studies in several cognitive aspects of animal behavior: focusing on emerging research in cognitive ecology, social learning and innovation, as well as animal logics; (iii) to review some important existing studies inspired by animal behavior and further present a perspective on the future research. These cognition-related topics offer insights for research fields such as machine learning, human computer interactions (HCI), brain computer interfaces (BCIs), evolutionary computing, pervasive computing, etc. In perspective, I suggest that the interaction between behavioral biology and computer science should be bidirectional, and a new subject, behavioral informatics, or more general computational behavior biology, should be developed by the cooperative efforts between biologists and computer scientists.

AB  - Digital literacy is a crucial skill set in the contemporary era, encompassing technical proficiency, information and media literacy, data literacy, and more. There are further disciplines that are incorporated into the broad concept of digital literacy, including cybersecurity, online safety, and responsible communication. The importance of critical thinking in digital contexts and the emerging field of digital wellbeing are addressed. There are challenges in achieving digital literacy including the lack of common frameworks and diverse barriers such as access to technology, affordability, and cultural differences. Ultimately digital literacy is something that requires the input of various stakeholders, including educators, governments, technology providers, and community organizations. There is a clear need for a collaborative, multi-pronged approach to address these challenges and the need for common agreement on what digital literacy is.

AB  - Summary
The ability to infer intentions of other agents, called theory of mind (ToM), confers strong advantages for individuals in social situations. Here, we show that ToM can also be maladaptive when people interact with complex modern institutions like financial markets. We tested participants who were investing in an experimental bubble market, a situation in which the price of an asset is much higher than its underlying fundamental value. We describe a mechanism by which social signals computed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex affect value computations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, thereby increasing an individual’s propensity to ‘ride’ financial bubbles and lose money. These regions compute a financial metric that signals variations in order flow intensity, prompting inference about other traders’ intentions. Our results suggest that incorporating inferences about the intentions of others when making value judgments in a complex financial market could lead to the formation of market bubbles.

AB  - We discuss some limitations of reflexive agents to motivate the need to develop cognitive agents and propose a hierarchical, layered, architecture for cognitive agents. Our examples often involve the discussion of cognitive agents in highway traffic models. A cognitive agent is an agent capable of performing cognitive acts, i.e. a sequence of the following activities: “Perceiving” information in the environment and provided by other agents, “Reasoning” about this information using existing knowledge, “Judging” the obtained information using existing knowledge, “Responding” to other cognitive agents or to the external environment, as it may be required, and “Learning”, i.e. changing (and, hopefully augmenting) the existing knowledge if the newly acquired information allows it. We describe how computational intelligence techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc) allow mimicking to a certain extent the cognitive acts performed by human beings. The order with which the cognitive actions take place is important and so is the order with which the various computational intelligence techniques are applied. We believe that a hierarchical layered model should be defined for the generic cognitive agents in a style akin to the hierarchical OSI 7 layer model used in data communication. We outline in broad sense such a reference model.

AB  - Recognized as the crown jewel of system software, Operating System (OS) is notoriously challenging to teach and learn, given its abstract concepts, broad scope, and the imperative for hands-on experience. How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community.

It is often studied from the molecular point of view as biomolecular interactions or from a more genetic point of view as phenotypic effects due to the role of DNA sequence variations and their influence on biological processes. We are now moving from an era of thinking about interactions among several genes to interacting networks or systems of many genes in a genome-wide scale. The study of gene interactions using systems genetics approaches is being made possible by advances in DNA sequencing technology and more powerful experimental, statistical, and computational methods.

The method was developed and a study was conducted of the dependence of the control quality and the time spent by the human operator on the evaluation of the test image. The influence of the clean delay time on the stability margin and the quality of the setting process is studied. The study shows that in intelligent systems that work in connection with a human-operator (a group of people) or independently, the time spent (a latent period) to implement thinking forms affects on the one hand the control quality, on the other the system stability. The desired value clean delay time is set. The research results are presented. The new parameter of information properties of intelligent systems has been introduced – the control quality.

AB  - Early identification and adequate treatment can help prevent lung disorders from becoming chronic, severe, and life-threatening. X-ray images are commonly used and an automated and effective method involving deep learning techniques can potentially contribute to quick and accurate diagnosis of lung disorders. However, in the study of medical imaging using deep learning, two obstacles limit interpretability. One is an insufficient and imbalanced number of training samples in most medical datasets. The other is excessive training time. Although training time can be reduced by decreasing the number of pixels in the images, training with low resolution images tends to result in poor performance. This study represents a solution to overcome these impediments by balancing the number of images and reducing overall processing time while preserving accuracy. The dataset used in this research contains an unequal number of images in the different classes. The quantity of data in the classes is balanced by creating synthetic images based on the patterns and characteristics of the original images, using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Unwanted regions are removed from the X-ray images, the brightness and contrast of the images are enhanced, and the abnormalities are highlighted by using different artifact removal, noise reduction, and enhancement techniques. We propose a Modified Compact Convolutional Transformer (MCCT) model using 32 × 32 sized images for the categorization of lung disorders into four classes. An ablation study of eleven cases is employed to adjust several hyper parameters and layer topologies. This reduces training time while preserving accuracy. Six transfer learning models, VGG19, VGG16, ResNet152, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, and MobileNet are applied with the same image size the performance is compared with the proposed MCCT model. Our MCCT model records the greatest test accuracy of 95.37%, requiring a short training time, 10-12 s/epoch, whereas the other models only reach near-moderate performance with accuracies ranging from 43% to 79% and training times of 80-90 s/epoch. The robustness of the model with regards to the number of training samples is validated by training the model multiple times reducing the number of training images gradually from 49621 images to 6204 images. Results suggest that even with a smaller dataset, the performance is sustained. Our proposed approach may contribute to an effective CAD based diagnostic system by addressing the issues of insufficient and imbalanced numbers of medical images, excessive training times and low-resolution images.

AB  - This paper proposes a computational modelling approach for investigating the interplay of learning and playing in serious games. A formal model is introduced that allows for studying the details of playing a serious game under diverse conditions. The dynamics of player action and motivation is based on cognitive flow theory, which is expressed in quantitative terms for this purpose. Seven extensive simulation studies involving over 100,000 iterations have demonstrated the stability of the model and its potential as a research instrument for serious gaming. The model allows researchers to deeply investigate quantitative dependences between relevant game variables, gain deeper understanding of how people learn from games, and develop approaches to improving serious game design.

Modern high performance computing technologies, quantum computing, computational intelligence are shown to be extremely efficient and useful in safeguarding the fate of mankind. These technologies are the state-of-the-art of IT evolution and are fundamental to be competitive and efficient today. If a company is familiar with these techniques and technologies, it will be able to deal with any unexpected and complicated scenarios more efficiently and effectively. The main contribution of our work is a set of best practices and case studies that can help the researcher address computationally complex problems. We offer a range of software technologies, from high performance computing to machine learning and quantum computing, which represent today the state-of-the-art to deal with extremely complex computational issues, driven by chaotic events and not easily predictable. In this chapter we analyze the different technologies and applications that will lead mankind to overcome this difficult moment as well as to understand more and more deeply the profound aspects of very complex phenomena. In this environment of rising complexity, in terms of technology, algorithms, and changing lifestyles, it is critical to emphasize the importance of achieving maximum efficiency and outcomes while protecting the integrity of everyone's personal data and respecting the human being as a whole.

AB  - In this work, the interaction between Kynurenic acid (KYNA) and several natural and modified cyclodextrins (CDs) is carried out. Among all the CD tested, HPβ-CD showed the strongest complexation constant (KF), with a value of 270.94 ± 29.80 M−1. Between natural (α- and β-) CDs, the complex of KYNA with β-CD was the most efficient. The inclusion complex of KYNA with CDs showed a strong influence of pH and temperature. The KF value decreased at high pH values, when the pKa was passed. Moreover, an increase of the temperature caused a decrease in the KF values. The thermodynamic parameters of the complexation (ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°) were studied with negative entropy, enthalpy and spontaneity of the process at 25 °C. Moreover, the inclusion complex was also characterized using FTIR and TGA. Finally, molecular docking calculations provided different interactions and their influence in the complexation constant.

AB  - Can children reason the Bayesian way? We argue that the answer to this question depends on how numbers are represented, because a representation can do part of the computation. We test, for the first time, whether Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in children by means of natural frequencies. We show that when information was presented to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders in terms of probabilities, their ability to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability was zero. Yet when the same information was presented in natural frequencies, Bayesian reasoning showed a steady increase from fourth to sixth grade, reaching an average level of 19, 39, and 53%, respectively, in two studies. Sixth graders' performance with natural frequencies matched the performance of adults with probabilities. But this general increase was accompanied by striking individual differences. More than half of the sixth graders solved most or all problems, whereas one third could not solve a single one. An analysis of the children's responses provides evidence for the use of three non-Bayesian strategies. These follow an overlapping wave model of development and continue to be observed in the minds of adults. More so than adults' probabilistic reasoning, children's reasoning depends on a proper representation of information.

AB  - We describe requirement-driven computational design thinking as an approach to leverage the distinctive characteristics of the digital design process. We primarily focus on information continuity and traceability in the digital medium. Requirement-driven design is an information-based approach facilitating consistent design rationale tracking and evaluation, verification, and validation of design. We present the characteristics of requirement-driven design, which leverage the pervasive nature of digital design thinking. We demonstrate a requirement–design coupling approach, modeling a continuous and interactive design process for integrating problem formulation and form exploration.

AB  - Teaching programming logic to students who do not have a background in computer science is challenging, as the instructor has to awaken problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills Several programming tools have been created to teach coding concepts to computer science students of different ages. However, these tools are not well designed to meet the challenge of teaching programming to new developers who come with school training in other areas such as accounting, management, etc. Therefore, this research focused on analyzing the importance of the application of online programming tools to students starting college who come with a school background in an area other than technology. A pre/post experimental design was carried out with 82 first-level students of the Technical University of Ambato in the careers of Systems and Electronics. The results revealed that 45% of the students increased their levels of application and analysis in programming processes. In addition, the research revealed that students who come from a background other than computer science agree with the integration of online programming tools from the first level of university entrance since this method helps to improve their learning capacity.

AB  - How to improve pre-service teachers’ argumentation skills has been receiving more and more attention from teacher educators. Visual cognitive tool refers to tools which users can learn with and creatively use to construct knowledge online. Current research revealed that it could help to improve learners’ higher-order thinking skills. This experimental study aimed to investigate the effect of two kinds of cognitive tools, the text-based online visual cognitive tool and the visual concept map, on improving the pre-service teachers’ skills on constructing and evaluating arguments. Post-test argumentation measurement scores and attitude questionnaire showed that the text-based cognitive tool was more effective than the concept map on improving pre-service teachers’ argumentation skills. However, the concept map was useful for externalizing the pre-service teachers’ thinking process as well as collaborative learning. This study also found that the pre-service teachers with teaching experience were inferior to the ones without any teaching experience in the ability on constructing arguments.

AB  - Contemporary methods of computational cognitive modeling have recently been criticized by Addyman and French (2012) on the grounds that they have not kept up with developments in computer technology and human–computer interaction. They present a manifesto for change according to which, it is argued, modelers should devote more effort to making their models accessible, both to non-modelers (with an appropriate easy-to-use user interface) and modelers alike. We agree that models, like data, should be freely available according to the normal standards of science, but caution against confusing implementations with specifications. Models may embody theories, but they generally also include implementation assumptions. Cognitive modeling methodology needs to be sensitive to this. We argue that specification, replication and experimentation are methodological approaches that can address this issue.

AB  - Cognitive hierarchy theory, a collection of structural models of non-equilibrium thinking, in which players’ best responses rely on heterogeneous beliefs on others’ strategies including naïve behavior, proved powerful in explaining observations from a wide range of games. We propose an inclusive cognitive hierarchy model, in which players do not rule out the possibility of facing opponents at their own thinking level. Our theoretical results show that inclusiveness is crucial for asymptotic properties of deviations from equilibrium behavior in expansive games. We show that the limiting behaviors are categorized in three distinct types: naïve, Savage rational with inconsistent beliefs, and sophisticated. We test the model in a laboratory experiment of collective decision-making. The data suggests that inclusiveness is indispensable with regard to explanatory power of the models of hierarchical thinking.

AB  - Leadership 4.0 focuses on leaders developing their digital transformation strategy and ensuring alignment with the organization’s business and development ambitions. This is accomplished by successfully displaying disruptive digital leadership characteristics, which include emotional and social intelligence abilities such as empathy and relationship management, cognitive preparedness, critical thinking, inventive thinking, agility, and resilience. Academics and consultants increasingly use Leadership 4.0 to describe the new leadership style required for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). It strategically addresses people’s concerns, which are crucial for the effective integration of Industry 4.0, and plays a significant and crucial role in integrating Industry 4.0 into modern workplaces. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore Leadership 4.0 and its needs. Several quality characteristics associated with Digital Leadership 4.0 are investigated, and two-dimensional style matrix presentations for Leadership 4.0 are briefed. Finally, this study identifies and addresses the role of Leadership 4.0 in upcoming industrial management systems. Because digital technologies now impact the entire business, advancing digital strategies requires strong leadership at all levels. With the increasing prevalence of digital transformation in the business sector and the intensification of the "battle for talent," organizations need to consider a more methodical approach to building a solid leadership pipeline with the capabilities required to lead in the digital era. They may place future leaders in positions that require them to go beyond their current competencies and skills to instruct and motivate them to promptly acquire new digital skills. In a new working setting, effectively managing the dynamic interactions between machines, technology, and people is essential for influential digital leaders. Leadership 4.0 is expected to foster an open and innovative culture that welcomes change and progress. This will encourage and inspire their teams to adapt to the ongoing changes in the market.

AB  - The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by intense spontaneous activity, depending on brain region, age, and behavioral state. Classically, the cortex is considered as being driven by the senses, a paradigm which corresponds well to experiments in quiescent or deeply anesthetized states. In awake animals, however, the spontaneous activity cannot be considered as ‘background noise’, but is of comparable—or even higher—amplitude than evoked sensory responses. Recent evidence suggests that this internal activity is not only dominant, but also it shares many properties with the responses to natural sensory inputs, suggesting that the spontaneous activity is not independent of the sensory input. Such evidence is reviewed here, with an emphasis on intracellular and computational aspects. Statistical measures, such as the spike-triggered average of synaptic conductances, show that the impact of internal network state on spiking activity is major in awake animals. Thus, cortical activity cannot be considered as being driven by the senses, but sensory inputs rather seem to modulate and modify the internal dynamics of cerebral cortex. This view offers an attractive interpretation not only of dreaming activity (absence of sensory input), but also of several mental disorders.

AB  - In this chapter we present a computational architecture intended to add clarity to the concept of consciousness. We briefly review some of the motivations of work done in this area in various institutes around the world and looks closely at our own work which specifically includes phenomenology, the sense of a self in a perceptual world. This breaks consciousness into five axioms: presence, imagination, attention, volition and emotions. It develops plausible mechanisms of each and how they interact to give a single sensation. An abstract architecture, the kernel architecture, is introduced as a starting point for building computational models. It is shown that through this architecture it is possible to discuss puzzling aspects of consciousness, for example are animals conscious? What happens when we dream? What goes on when we experience an illusion? This paper is intended to elucidate and update some concepts introduced in Aleksander (2005).

AB  - It is acknowledged that technological innovation is needed in all sectors to cope with new demands. From social innovations, it introduces novel ideas, whether products, services, or models, to fulfil societal needs and foster new partnerships or collaborations. The aim is to enhance social interactions and elevate human well-being. Development of cutting-edge digital technologies is reality. The challenge is on human resource side, how quickly we can prepare employees to adapt to the requirements of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. In the paper, the new competencies were identified with the business stakeholders by conducting a survey among industry partners to recognize the requirements for the future labor market. The stakeholders in the construction field act as target groups for monitoring and development of the competencies. The focus of the result part is on the competencies companies mostly miss from their employees from digital perspectives, e.g. reason to hire highly educated people, training possibilities for digitally upskilling employees, lacking appropriate competencies (critical thinking, systems and analytical thinking, information management, advanced computer/IT skills (AI), ensuring security). Digital skills Advanced data/IT skills were the competencies in that companies defined as key competencies expected to be developed in 21st-century higher education employees. It is highly important to consider the job market needs for development and to adopt the engineering education system to be responsive to the needs of labor market.

AB  - Experimental FTIR, NMR and UV-visible spectrum analyses were used to describe the title compound 2-Hydroxy-1-Naphthaldehyde. The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational wave numbers were determined by using the DFT approach and B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) basis set. VEDA was used to determine the vibrational assignments. The GIAO technique was used to compute carbon and proton NMR chemical shifts in CDCl3. The most reactive location of the 2H1NA molecule, according to MEP map analysis, is the site containing the oxygen atom. TD-DFT approach was used to produce the theoretical UV-visible spectrum in MeOH and gas phase. HOMO-LUMO and Donor-Acceptor (NBO) interactions were investigated for the title compound. In addition, nonlinear optical characteristics, ELF and Fukui activity were investigated. Temperature-dependent thermodynamic characteristics were also computed. The 3D intermolecular interactions of the crystal surface were characterised using Hirshfeld surface analysis, whereas the 2D interactions were explained using fingerprint plots. 2H1NA was stabilized by the development of H—H/H—C/H—O contacts. The bioactive probability of the title molecule was theoretically demonstrated by computing the electrophilicity index. In a biological study six different receptors, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the best ligand-protein interactions and likeness to the active substance. Biomolecular stability was investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation.

AB  - The role of aesthetics in determining usability of interactive systems has come under focus in recent time. The issue is relevant for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) containing elements of widely varying nature. It is important to evaluate GUI aesthetically to determine their acceptability to the users. Computational models have been reported in the literature to perform objective assessment of interface aesthetics. However, the existing models only consider geometric features at the highest level, without considering the content inside the geometry. To address this issue, we propose a computational model to evaluate aesthetics of textual contents present on a GUI. The proposed model is based on empirical data collected from user studies. The model is a weighted sum of six features characterizing text: chromatic contrast, luminance contrast, font size, letter spacing, line height and word spacing. A separate validation study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of the model (showing 87% accuracy in model prediction), which is expected to be useful in predicting usability of a web page in a more refined way. Such modeling has its obvious implications in the context of engineering interactive systems. The proposed model along with the user studies are presented in this paper.

CMP was developed based on the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards and can be characterized as a problem-based curriculum. CMP teachers were more than three times as likely to implement high-level instructional tasks than non-CMP teachers. Increases in the cognitive demand were associated with enhanced growth rates in problem solving, computation, and equation solving. Notably, when controlling for the cognitive demand of the instructional tasks, the advantage of the CMP curriculum over the non-CMP curricula on students’ growth in problem solving disappeared. However, non-CMP curricula had an advantage on students’ growth over the CMP curriculum after the cognitive demand of the instructional tasks was controlled.

AB  - The benefits of applying multi-objective optimization (MOO) in building design have been increasingly recognized in recent decades. The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used.

AB  - There is now over a 20-year history of green and sustainable chemistry efforts in the US, but for a majority of chemicals that have been synthesized, chemists and chemical engineers lack key information about what it takes to commercialize them, their toxicity to humans or the environment, their degradability (biological or otherwise), their ability to be recycled or reused, or their ability to be source renewably. While the depth, breadth, and variety of innovations in chemistry gives one hope that chemists and chemical engineers will make many significant advances in the next 20 years, there is still a need to incorporate systems and life cycle thinking into chemistry. This is especially true as one considers limitations in the supply of key elements chemists rely on very heavily. Recent advances in computational chemistry and machine learning show great promise for moving chemistry toward a more sustainable practice of chemistry.

AB  - Arithmetic reasoning activates the occipital cortex of congenitally blind people (CB). This activation of visual areas may highlight the functional flexibility of occipital regions deprived of their dominant inputs or relate to the intrinsic computational role of specific occipital regions. We contrasted these competing hypotheses by characterizing the brain activity of CB and sighted participants while performing subtraction, multiplication and a control letter task. In both groups, subtraction selectively activated a bilateral dorsal network commonly activated during spatial processing. Multiplication triggered activity in temporal regions thought to participate in memory retrieval. No between-group difference was observed for the multiplication task whereas subtraction induced enhanced activity in the right dorsal occipital cortex of the blind individuals only. As this area overlaps with regions showing selective tuning to auditory spatial processing and exhibits increased functional connectivity with a dorsal “spatial” network, our results suggest that the recruitment of occipital regions during high-level cognition in the blind actually relates to the intrinsic computational role of the activated regions.

AB  - The correlation between individuals’ creativity performances in a one-to-one interactive situation was preliminarily explored. Neuroimaging has provided many insights into the neural connectome that underlies creativity; however, the role of brain structure in individuals’ creativity performance when collaborating with others remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this study collected data from 74 single- and paired-player participants using an interactive creativity task platform, including the alternative use task (AUT) and the Chinese Radical Remote Associates Test (CRRAT). Participants’ AUT and CRRAT scores in the above two modes were collected to analyze the moderating effects of connective efficiency (CE). The results showed that the relationship between originality performance in the single- and paired-player modes was moderated by four theoretical graph measures. Specifically, in the case of a high clustering coefficient, local efficiency, global efficiency, or low characteristic path length, individual originality performance was more predictive of interactive originality. Additionally, the relationship between fluency performance in the above two modes was not moderated by CE, flexibility, or CRRAT performance. This study identified the effects of neural transmission efficiency on the relationship between creativity in the two modes. This study investigated neurocognitive factors influencing creativity performance in interactive situations.

AB  - While artificial intelligence and machine learning is becoming a commonplace feature of people’s everyday lives, so far few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating it in K-12​ education. Drawing on the sociocultural theory of learning and participation, this case study explored how six very young children taught and explored Google’s Teachable Machine in nonschool settings. Through fine-grained analysis of video recordings and interviews with the children, the article illustrates the content and the process of teaching where 3–9 year old children were producing machine learning data sets and models as well as observing, exploring, and explaining their own interaction with machine learning systems. The results illustrate the quick-paced and embodied nature of the child-computer interaction that also supported children to reason about the relationship between their own bodily expressions and the output of an interactive ML-based tool. The article concludes with discussions on the emergent process of teaching and learning as well as on ways of promoting children’s participation and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.

AB  - Purpose
This paper examines how mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) learn to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through lesson study (LS).
Design/methodology/approach
A LS team with three MTEs conducted three iterations of LS on teaching the Pythagorean Theorem in an in-person, technology-mediated environment. Many forms of data were collected: Desmos activities, videos of research lessons (RLs), videos of MTE RL debriefings, artifacts of student learning in the Desmos Dashboard, and MTEs' written self-reflection. The authors investigate the teacher educators' learning through LS by analyzing the MTE debriefings of the RLs using Bannister’s (2015) framework for teacher learning in communities of practice.
Findings
The MTEs learned to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through addressing emerging issues related to intellectual authority and use of student thinking. Throughout the LS, the MTEs sought ways of promoting students' mathematical authority and using student thinking through features of the Desmos platform.
Research limitations/implications
This study focuses on MTEs' learning without examining participating preservice teachers' learning. It demonstrates the benefits of LS for MTEs' professional learning.
Practical implications
This study showcases how a research-based Desmos activity is used and refined to promote MTE learning how to implement equitable mathematics instruction.
Originality/value
The study contributes to better understanding of how LS could be used to develop MTEs' professional learning. Moreover, the dual process of participation and reification was concretized through diagnostic and prognostic frames in the LS context, which enriches the concept of community of practice.

AB  - Cervical spine injuries continue to be a costly societal problem. Future advancements in injury prevention depend on improved physical and computational models, which are predicated on a better understanding of the neck response during dynamic loading. Previous studies have shown that the tolerance of the neck is dependent on its initial position and its buckling behavior. This study uses a computational model to examine three important factors hypothesized to influence the loads experienced by vertebrae in the neck under compressive impact: muscle activation, torso constraints, and pre-flexion angle of the cervical spine. Since cadaver testing is not practical for large scale parametric analyses, these factors were studied using a previously validated computational model. On average, simulations with active muscles had 32% larger compressive forces and 25% larger shear forces—well in excess of what was expected from the muscle forces alone. In the short period of time required for neck injury, constraints on torso motion increased the average neck compression by less than 250N. The pre-flexion hypothesis was tested by examining pre-flexion angles from neutral (0°) to 64°. Increases in pre-flexion resulted in the largest increases in peak loads and the expression of higher-order buckling modes. Peak force and buckling modality were both very sensitive to pre-flexion angle. These results validate the relevance of prior cadaver models for neck injury and help explain the wide variety of cervical spine fractures that can result from ostensibly similar compressive loadings. They also give insight into the mechanistic differences between burst fractures and lower cervical spine dislocations.

AB  - Cancer mutations that are recurrently observed among patients are known as hotspots. Hotspots are highly relevant because they are, presumably, likely functional. Known hotspots in BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53, KRAS, IDH1 support this idea. However, hundreds of hotspots have never been validated experimentally. The detection of hotspots nevertheless is challenging because background mutations obscure their statistical and computational identification. Although several algorithms have been applied to identify hotspots, they have not been reviewed before. Thus, in this mini-review, we summarize more than 40 computational methods applied to detect cancer hotspots in coding and non-coding DNA. We first organize the methods in cluster-based, 3D, position-specific, and miscellaneous to provide a general overview. Then, we describe their embed procedures, implementations, variations, and differences. Finally, we discuss some advantages, provide some ideas for future developments, and mention opportunities such as application to viral integrations, translocations, and epigenetics.

AB  - Abundant new information about signaling pathways in forebrain microcircuits presents many challenges, and opportunities for discovery, to computational neuroscientists who strive to bridge from microcircuits to flexible cognition and action. Accurate treatment of microcircuit pathways is especially critical for creating models that correctly predict the outcomes of candidate neurological therapies. Recent models are trying to specify how cortical circuits that enable planning and voluntary actions interact with adaptive subcortical microcircuits in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are strongly implicated in reinforcement learning, and in all behavior and cognition over which the frontal lobes exert flexible control. The persisting role of the basal ganglia shows that ancient vertebrate designs for motivated action selection proved adaptable enough to support many “modern” behavioral innovations, including fluent generation of language and speech. This paper summarizes how recent models have incorporated realistic representations of microcircuit features, and have begun to trace their computational implications. Also summarized are recent empirical discoveries that provide guidance regarding how to formulate the rules for synaptic modification that govern learning in cortico-striatal pathways. Such efforts are contributing to an emerging synthesis based on an interlocking set of computational hypotheses regarding cortical interactions with basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. These hypotheses specify how specialized microcircuits solve learning and control problems inherent to the brain’s parallel design.

AB  - Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of identifying the profiles and capabilities of attackers injecting adversarial inputs to a cyber-physical system. The system in question interacts with attackers of different levels of intelligence, each employing different feedback controllers against the system. Principles of behavioral game theory – specifically the concept of level-k thinking – is employed to construct a database of potential attack vectors. By observing the state trajectories under sequential interactions with different adversaries, the defender adaptively estimates both the number and profiles of the different attack signals using an online deterministic annealing approach. This information is used to dynamically estimate the level of intelligence of the attackers. Simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB  - Impaired Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) in dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its precursor Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is well known. Yet, it remains open whether this impairment mirrors the breakdown of semantic memory retrieval processes or executive control processes. Therefore, qualitative analysis of the SVF has been proposed but is limited in terms of methodology and feasibility in clinical practice. Consequently, research draws no conclusive picture which of these afore-mentioned processes drives the SVF impairment in AD and MCI. This study uses a qualitative computational approach—combining temporal and semantic information—to investigate exploitation and exploration patterns as indicators for semantic memory retrieval and executive control processes. Audio SVF recordings of 20 controls (C, 66–81 years), 55 MCI (57–94 years) and 20 AD subjects (66–82 years) were assessed while groups were matched according to age and education. All groups produced, on average, the same amount of semantically related items in rapid succession within word clusters. Conversely, towards AD, there was a clear decline in semantic as well as temporal exploration patterns between clusters. Results strongly point towards preserved exploitation—semantic memory retrieval processes—and hampered exploration—executive control processes—in AD and potentially in MCI.

AB  - Reinforcement learning models provide an excellent example of how a computational process approach can help organize ideas and understanding of underlying neurobiology. In a strong sense, this is the assumption behind computational neuroscience. Computational psychiatry, as a translational arm of computational neuroscience, can also profit from the computational process approach but applied at many levels ranging from low-level neurobiology through characterization of mental states and even up to the level of multiple interacting humans. Here, we review some of the early evidence for why reinforcement learning in its modern versions moves well beyond behaviorist accounts and provides an excellent “computational paradigm” for framing value-dependent decision-making; something that goes awry in a number of psychiatry conditions. We focus in particular on how social exchange between humans can engage reward systems and can be used as a computational device good for parsing subjects into categories that relate in interesting ways to traditional depictions of psychopathology.

AB  - Existing principal curve algorithms have some drawbacks such as time consuming and narrow application scope in practice, since these algorithms are mainly based on global optimization. In this paper, we present the concept of Constraint Local Principal Curve (CLPC), which uses local optimization methods and restricts the principal curve with two fixed endpoints to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we propose three CLPC algorithms by Local Optimization and Adaptive Radius to expand the range of applications and increase the solution quality. The first algorithm, i.e., CLPCg is based on greedy thinking. The second algorithm, i.e., CLPCs uses one dimensional search and the last algorithm CLPCc combines the greedy thinking and one dimensional search. Then, we define six performance indices to evaluate the performance of the CLPC algorithms. Finally, we present some numerical experiments with three simulation data sets and two GPS measured data sets in both highway and railway. The results indicate that all of the three CLPC algorithms can obtain high-accuracy data from multiple low-accuracy data efficiently. The CLPC algorithms can improve the accuracy and computational speed compared with the existing K-segment principal curve (KPC) algorithm. In addition, CLPCc outperforms CLPCg and CLPCs according to the comprehensive experiments while CLPCg runs much faster than other ones.

AB  - With the progress of the times and the improvement of science and technique, network message technique has occupied a vital position in people's lives. At the same time, society has been implementing university English education reform in recent years, and the “internet plus” wisdom education model is the product of the improvement of the times. This new education model has gradually integrated into the education of various subjects. Introducing the concept of message technique and wisdom education into university translation education can innovate education mode, optimize education content, and integrate high-quality education resources. Cultivating applied translators has become the trend of educational reform. Based on deep learning, this paper studies translation education skills in universities. In-depth education enables learners to acquire systematic knowledge, critical spirit, creative thinking, etc. This kind of learning fully taps individual potential to cultivate a complete personality. According to the research in this paper, wisdom education is 12% better than traditional education, and it is suitable to be widely put into practice.

AB  - The nickel catalyzed regio- and stereoselective condensation of boronic acids to allenamides is documented as a novel synthetic route to stereochemically defined tri-substituted enamides. The protocol has been implemented into a three-component variant intercepting the in situ formed allyl-Ni intermediate with a range of aldehydes. Additionally, evidence for the effective extension of this methodology to Me2Zn is documented. Full rationale on the mechanism as well as its stereochemical outcome is provided by a synergistic experimental/computational approach.

AB  - This research shares progressions in thinking about equations and the equal sign observed in ten students who took part in an early algebra classroom intervention across Kindergarten and first grade. We report on data from task-based interviews conducted prior to the intervention and at the conclusion of each school year that elicited students’ interpretations of the equal sign and equations of various forms. We found at the beginning of the intervention that most students viewed the equal sign as an operational symbol and did not accept many equations forms as valid. By the end of first grade, almost all students described the symbol as indicating the equivalence of two amounts and were much more successful interpreting and working with equations in a variety of forms. The progressions we observed align with those of other researchers and provide evidence that very young students can learn to reason flexibly about equations.

AB  - In constructivist principles, learning is a process in which individuals construct knowledge. Research in Mathematics Education looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of “changing the sign” when “moving” the member. To minimize this problem, a balance can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2) determine how substituting the conventional balance with a computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity, negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First, because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue, cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for solving 1st degree equations.

AB  - With computation models playing an ever increasing role in the advancement of science, it is important that researchers understand what it means to model something; recognize the implications of the conceptual, mathematical and algorithmic steps of model construction; and comprehend what models can and cannot do. Here, we use examples to show that models can serve a wide variety of roles, including hypothesis testing, generating new insights, deepening understanding, suggesting and interpreting experiments, tracing chains of causation, doing sensitivity analyses, integrating knowledge, and inspiring new approaches. We show that models can bring together information of different kinds and do so across a range of length scales, as they do in multi-scale, multi-faceted embryogenesis models, some of which connect gene expression, the cytoskeleton, cell properties, tissue mechanics, morphogenetic movements and phenotypes. Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon. Although the examples in this article are taken primarily from the field of embryo mechanics, most of the arguments and discussion are applicable to any form of computational modelling.

AB  - This paper presents a computational method that can efficiently estimate the ability of students from the log files of a Web-based learning environment capturing their problem solving processes. The computational method developed in this study approximates the posterior distribution of the student’s ability obtained from the conventional Bayes Modal Estimation (BME) approach to a simple Gaussian function in order to reduce the amount of computations required in the subsequent ability update processes. To verify the correctness and usefulness of this method, the abilities of 407 college students who solved 61 physics problems in a Web-based learning environment were estimated from the log files of the learning environment. The reduced chi-squared statistic and Pearson’s chi-square test for the goodness of fit indicate that the estimated abilities were able to successfully explain the observed problem solving performance of students within error. The educational implications of estimating the ability of students in Web-based learning environments were also discussed.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence foundation models (for example Generative Pre-trained Transformer – GPT – models) can generate the next token given a sequence of tokens. How can this ‘generative AI’ be compared with the ‘real’ intelligence of the human brain, when for example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has interesting implications for the further development of generative AI and for neuroscience research.

AB  - The neocortex plays a crucial role in all basic and abstract cognitive functions. Conscious mental processes are achieved through a correct flow of information within and across neocortical networks, whose particular activity state results from a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. The proper equilibrium between these indissoluble forces is operated with multiscale organization: along the dendro–somatic axis of single neurons and at the network level. Fast synaptic inhibition is assured by a multitude of inhibitory interneurons. During cortical activities, these cells operate a finely tuned division of labor that is epitomized by their detailed connectivity scheme. Recent results combining the use of mouse genetics, cutting-edge optical and neurophysiological approaches have highlighted the role of fast synaptic inhibition in driving cognition-related activity through a canonical cortical circuit, involving several major interneuron subtypes and principal neurons. Here we detail the organization of this cortical blueprint and we highlight the crucial role played by different neuron types in fundamental cortical computations. In addition, we argue that this canonical circuit is prone to many variations on the theme, depending on the resolution of the classification of neuronal types, and the cortical area investigated. Finally, we discuss how specific alterations of distinct inhibitory circuits can underlie several devastating brain diseases.

Further, when working collaboratively, the conversations that occur between collaborators seldom appear in final publications either. The development of the mobile application QualNotes, provided a productive digital space for collaboration across disciplines. In this paper, we use three vignettes to explicate the ‘backend’ of the development of that mobile application. We chart howour collaborative cross-disciplinary ethnography revealed the generative potential of thinking-with the digital and across disciplinary divides. This paper's contribution is in revealing ‘how’ we work using our disciplinary expertise, but at the same time at the edges of those disciplines too, where we contest, argue, adapt, understand, and, where we learn.

AB  - Appraisal theories of emotion argue that emotions arise from a process of comparing individual needs and concerns to external demands. That is, emotions cannot be explained by solely focusing on the environment or by solely focusing on the individual. Rather, they reflect an individual’s subjective assessment of their relation to the environment. Appraisal theories further posit this relationship is characterized by the individual (appraised) in terms of a set of criteria, variously called appraisal variables, checks, or dimensions; for example, Is an event congruent with a person’s goals or concerns?; Who or what caused it?; Was it unexpected?; and What control does the person have over its unfolding? The results of these appraisal checks are in turn mapped to emotion. In this chapter, we do not explore appraisal as a theory of emotion elicitation. Rather, we suggest appraisal theories, specifically the criteria that appraisal theories posit, provide a useful framework for characterizing how situations are perceived by a person and influence their behavior. We go on to suggest that computational models of appraisal can provide a clear specification of how these criteria are assessed. Furthermore, such models can help us explore the dynamics of the person-environment relation, specifically how changes in the environment as well as changes in the person’s perceptions and behavior arise and induce those dynamics.

AB  - We provide an overview of the role of parallel finite element computations in fluid mechanics. We emphasize the class of flow problems involving moving boundaries and interfaces. Some of the computationally most challenging flow problems, such as fluid–object and fluid–structure interactions as well as free-surface and two-fluid flows, belong to this class. In the development of the methods targeting this class of problems, the computational challenges involved need to be addressed in such a way that 3D computation of complex applications can be carried out efficiently on parallel computers. This requirement has to be one of the key factors in designing various components of the overall solution approach, such as solution techniques for the discretized equations and mesh update methods for handling the changes in the spatial domain occupied by the fluid. This overview includes a description of how the computational challenges are addressed and how the computational schemes can be enhanced with special preconditioning techniques.

AB  - Despite large incentives, correctness in software remains an elusive goal. Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem, since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming, because a strategy which is both efficient and fully general to derive algorithms from specifications does not yet exist. To address this bottleneck, I propose information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide information about a query via the most efficient routes. Within this framework, opportunities to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be articulated and a system might be designed to achieve them. The computation of the information measures that are the basis of this strategy crucially depends on a probabilistic semantics for the relations represented by predicates, which may either already be present in a probabilistic logic language, or may be superimposed on a pure logic language. I describe a prototype implementation of Fifth, a system that implements these techniques, and a preliminary empirical study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program. In the test, the evaluation strategy adapts successfully to efficiently evaluate a query with pathological features that would prevent its evaluation by standard general-purpose strategies.

AB  - The aim of this work is to introduce a trust model, which is highly consistent with the social nature of trust in computational domains. To this end, we propose a hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision making based computational trust model capable of taking into account the fundamental building blocks corresponding to the concept of trust. The proposed model is capable of considering the contextuality property of trust and the subjective priorities of the trustor regarding the chosen goal. This is due to viewing trust not as a single label or an integrated concept, but as a collection of trustworthiness facets that may form the trust decision in various contexts and toward different goals. The main benefit of the proposed model is the consideration of the hesitancy of recommenders and the trustor in the process of trust decision making which can create a more flexible mapping between the social and computational requirements of trust. This type of formulation also allows for taking into account the vagueness of the provided opinions. In addition to the vagueness of the provided opinions, the model is capable of considering the certainty of recommendations and its effect on the aggregation process of gathered opinions. In the proposed model, the taste of the recommenders and the similarity of opinions are also considered. This will allow the model to assign more weight to recommendations that have a similar taste compared to the trustor. Finally, taking into consideration the attitudes of the trustors toward change of personality that may occur for various entities in the environment is another advantage of the proposed model. A step-by-step illustrative example and the results of several experimental evaluations, which demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model, are also presented in this paper.

AB  - We discuss certain basic features of the equation-free (EF) approach to modeling and computation for complex/multiscale systems. We focus on links between the equation-free approach and tools from systems and control theory (design of experiments, data analysis, estimation, identification and feedback). As our illustrative example, we choose a specific numerical task (the detection of stability boundaries in parameter space) for stochastic models of two simplified heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. In the equation-free framework the stochastic simulator is treated as an experiment (albeit a computational one). Short bursts of fine scale simulation (short computational experiments) are designed, executed, and their outputs processed and fed back to the process, in integrated protocols aimed at performing the particular coarse-grained task (the detection of a macroscopic instability). Two distinct approaches are presented; one is a direct translation of our previous protocol for adaptive detection of instabilities in laboratory experiments [Rico-Martinez, R., Krisher, K., Flatgen, G., Anderson, J. S., & Kevrekidis, I. G. (2003). Adaptive detection of instabilities: An experimental feasibility study. Physica D, 176, 1–18]; the second approach is motivated from numerical bifurcation algorithms for critical point detection. A comparison of the two approaches brings forth a key feature of equation-free computation: computational experiments can be easily initialized at will, in contrast to laboratory ones.

AB  - The brain is thought to implement two decision-making systems: a goal-directed system in which decisions are made through planning on the basis of action–outcome relationships, and a habitual system in which behaviour reflects stimulus–response associations. A prominent theory of addiction sees it as arising due to an extreme dominance of habit over goal-directed action. The balance between these systems is thought to be arbitrated by the relative precision of their separate predictions of reward. In this paper, we argue that various factors in addiction create hyper-precise reward predictions in the habitual system and hypo-precise reward predictions in the goal-directed system, shifting the balance of behavioural control in favour of habit. Based on this, we offer a theoretical account of the utility of episodic future thinking in addiction, interpreting it as increasing the precision of reward estimates in the goal-directed system, thereby enhancing the control of this system over behaviour.

AB  - The paper considers the approach to solving the task of storing data in the Web environment using semantic networks (SN). The control over the access to SN is identified as a critical task. An approach to the solution based on the use of the controlling SN is proposed. The rationale for the approach involves developing a computational model for supporting the access operations. The construction of a model based on intensional logic is proposed. The basic logical constructions, necessary for building a model, are considered. The testing of the model’s constructions was performed when building the tools of semantic support for the implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).

AB  - As an integrative discipline, neuroscience can serve as a vehicle for the development of integrative thinking skills and broad-based scientific proficiency in undergraduate students. Undergraduate neuroscience curricula incorporate fundamental concepts from multiple disciplines. Deepening the explicit exploration of these connections in a neuroscience core curriculum has the potential to support more meaningful and successful undergraduate STEM learning for neuroscience students. Curriculum and faculty development activities related to an integrative core curriculum can provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines and departments to advance common goals of inclusive excellence in STEM. These efforts facilitate analysis of the institutional STEM curriculum from the student perspective, and assist in creating an internal locus of accountability for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the institution. Faculty at the College of the Holy Cross have undertaken the collaborative design and implementation of an integrative core curriculum for neuroscience that embraces principles of inclusive pedagogy, emphasizes the connections between neuroscience and other disciplines, and guides students to develop broad proficiency in fundamental STEM concepts and skills.

AB  - The development of the cerebral cortex requires the tightly coordinated generation of dozens of neuronal subtypes that will populate specific layers and areas. Recent studies have revealed how pluripotent stem cells (PSC), whether of mouse or human origin, can differentiate into a wide range of cortical neurons in vitro, which can integrate appropriately into the brain following in vivo transplantation. These models are largely artificial but recapitulate a substantial fraction of the complex temporal and regional patterning events that occur during in vivo corticogenesis. Here, we review these findings with emphasis on the new perspectives that they have brought for understanding of cortical development, evolution, and diseases.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a shift in modern dance education. Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.

Response latencies exhibited a significant cross-over interaction as a function of age and response type (correct vs. incorrect). 3.5-year-olds’ incorrect latencies were faster than their correct latencies, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for 4.5- and 5.5-year-olds. Although these results are most consistent with conceptual change theories of false-belief reasoning, no extant theory fully accounts for our data pattern. We argue that response latency data provide new information about underlying cognitive processes in theory of mind reasoning, and can shed light on concept acquisition more broadly.

AB  - Cadherins are a superfamily of cell surface glycoproteins whose ectodomains contain multiple repeats of β-sandwich extracellular cadherin (EC) domains that adopt a similar fold to immunoglobulin domains. The best characterized cadherins are the vertebrate ‘classical’ cadherins, which mediate adhesion via trans homodimerization between their membrane-distal EC1 domains that extend from apposed cells, and assemble intercellular adherens junctions through cis clustering. To form mature trans adhesive dimers, cadherin domains from apposed cells dimerize in a ‘strand-swapped’ conformation. This occurs in a two-step binding process involving a fast-binding intermediate called the ‘X-dimer’. Trans dimers are less flexible than cadherin monomers, a factor that drives junction assembly following cell–cell contact by reducing the entropic cost associated with the formation of lateral cis oligomers. Cadherins outside the classical subfamily appear to have evolved distinct adhesive mechanisms that are only now beginning to be understood.

We pay special attention to the theories that changed our way of thinking about problem solving, and to the role played by the European Journal of Operational Research in the development of these theories. Our approach emphasizes methodologies and their connections with related areas, which permits to identify potential lines of future research.

AB  - This paper adds to the growing body of research happening in multivariable calculus by examining scalar and vector line integrals. This paper contributes in two ways. First, this paper provides a conceptual analysis for both types of line integrals in terms of how theoretical ways of thinking about definite integrals summarized from the research literature might be applied to understanding line integrals specifically. Second, this paper provides an initial investigation of students’ understandings of line integral expressions, and connects these understanding to the theoretical ways of thinking drawn from the literature. One key finding from the empirical part is that several students appeared to understand individual pieces of the integral expression based on one way of thinking, such as adding up pieces or anti-derivatives, while trying to understand the overall integral expression through a different way of thinking, such as area under a curve.

AB  - Background
Cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs) can be used to study genetic cardiac diseases. In patients these diseases are manifested e.g. with impaired contractility and fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and both of these can be due to abnormal calcium transients in cardiomyocytes. Here we classify different genetic cardiac diseases using Ca2+ transient data and different machine learning algorithms.
Methods
By studying calcium cycling of disease-specific iPSC-CMs and by using calcium transients measured from these cells it is possible to classify diseases from each other and also from healthy controls by applying machine learning computation on the basis of peak attributes detected from calcium transient signals.
Results
In the current research we extend our previous study having Ca-transient data from four different genetic diseases by adding data from two additional diseases (dilated cardiomyopathy and long QT Syndrome 2). We also study, in the light of the current data, possible differences and relations when machine learning modelling and classification accuracies were computed by using either leave-one-out test or 10-fold cross-validation.
Conclusions
Despite more complex classification tasks compared to our earlier research and having more different genetic cardiac diseases in the analysis, it is still possible to attain good disease classification results. As excepted, leave-one-out test and 10-fold cross-validation achieved virtually equal results.

AB  - The climate change and the increasing complexity of the energy sector along with the prerequisite for sustainability have broadened the energy policy shaping field by bringing out new challenges. Decision support tools and methods, such as Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA), are necessary for energy policy, in the pursuit of appropriate approaches necessary to support the restructuring of the energy sector, concerning patterns of energy extraction, generation, transformation and use, from unsustainable to sustainable forms of development. Papers devoted to the investigation of MCDA models using linguistic variables for energy policy support seem to be not available in the international literature. The scope of this paper is to explore different linguistic representation and computational models in MCDA that are or can be applied to energy policy support and to establish a clear linkage between them. This paper argues that MCDA methodologies with direct computation on linguistic variables can support energy policy frameworks, bridging the gap between energy policy makers thinking, reasoning, representation and computing. Finally, current trends, open questions and prospects in this topic are pointed out.

AB  - We propose a computational model of perceptual categorization that fuses elements of grounded and sensorimotor theories of cognition with dynamic models of decision-making. We assume that category information consists in anticipated patterns of agent–environment interactions that can be elicited through overt or covert (simulated) eye movements, object manipulation, etc. This information is firstly encoded when category information is acquired, and then re-enacted during perceptual categorization. The perceptual categorization consists in a dynamic competition between attractors that encode the sensorimotor patterns typical of each category; action prediction success counts as “evidence” for a given category and contributes to falling into the corresponding attractor. The evidence accumulation process is guided by an active perception loop, and the active exploration of objects (e.g., visual exploration) aims at eliciting expected sensorimotor patterns that count as evidence for the object category. We present a computational model incorporating these elements and describing action prediction, active perception, and attractor dynamics as key elements of perceptual categorizations. We test the model in three simulated perceptual categorization tasks, and we discuss its relevance for grounded and sensorimotor theories of cognition.

One of the useful methods of using crop residues is in the form of biochar obtained after employing thermo-chemical routes. Apart from the crop residues, the carbon rich contents obtained from forest, animal compost, waste plastics, etc., can be heated in oxygen starved atmosphere, that left char having enriched carbon and trace amount of minerals finds extensive applications in agriculture, especially to make soil more fertile, as a carbon sequestration agent, increases crops yields, etc. This review focuses on the synthetic strategies adopted to obtain biochar, and the numerous applications in various fields. Further, the interactions involved in between the host–guest molecules are explained using computational studies like Density Functional Theory, Artificial Neural Network analysis, Machine Learning methods, and Visual MINTEQ program.

AB  - According to the dual-process model of moral judgment, utilitarian responses to moral conflict draw on limited cognitive resources. Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.

AB  - Understanding the fundamental organisational principles underlying the complex and multilayered process of angiogenesis is the mutual aim of both the experimental and theoretical angiogenesis communities. Surprisingly, these two fields have in the past developed in near total segregation, with neither fully benefiting from the other. However, times are changing and here we report on the new direction that angiogenesis research is taking, where from well-integrated collaborations spring new surprises, experimental predictions and research avenues. We show that several successful ongoing collaborations exist in the angiogenesis field and analyse what aspects of their approaches led them to achieve novel and impactful biological insight. We conclude that there are common elements we can learn from for the future, and provide a list of guidelines to building a successful collaborative venture. Specifically, we find that a near symbiosis of computation with experimentation reaps the most impactful results by close cyclical feedback and communication between the two disciplines resulting in continual refinement of models, experimental directions and our understanding. We discuss high impact examples of predictive modelling from the wider, more established integrated scientific domains and conclude that the angiogenesis community can do nothing but benefit from joining this brave new, integrated world.

AB  - There is a widespread stated desire amongst both public and private organizations worldwide to engage in more significant “evidence-based reasoning” and to be more “data-driven.” We argue that these two goals are proxies for the often-unstated goal of improving the exploration of possible futures as foresights that could lead to better strategic decisions and improved business outcomes. From this perspective, data and analytics hold great promise and are necessary—but not sufficient—for improving strategic decision-making. Something more is needed to realize this potential. We specify how to fill this gap using an integration framework between technology and decision-makers, which is especially appropriate in complex and/or volatile environments. Our solution—which comprises a methodology as well as a software architecture—therefore unifies not only human decision makers to technology but each other and also integrates several disciplines that have been hitherto unnecessarily separated. Thereby, it could help organizations to address increasing challenges better as well as improve the exploration of possible futures.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, arise from abnormalities in brain systems that underlie cognitive, emotional, and social functions. The brain is enormously complex and its abundant feedback loops on multiple scales preclude intuitive explication of circuit functions. In close interplay with experiments, theory and computational modeling are essential for understanding how, precisely, neural circuits generate flexible behaviors and their impairments give rise to psychiatric symptoms. This Perspective highlights recent progress in applying computational neuroscience to the study of mental disorders. We outline basic approaches, including identification of core deficits that cut across disease categories, biologically realistic modeling bridging cellular and synaptic mechanisms with behavior, and model-aided diagnosis. The need for new research strategies in psychiatry is urgent. Computational psychiatry potentially provides powerful tools for elucidating pathophysiology that may inform both diagnosis and treatment. To achieve this promise will require investment in cross-disciplinary training and research in this nascent field.

AB  - In this work, I propose a new method for the computation of informational entropy from Recurrence Plots when the analyzed time series are categorical in nature. In such cases, there is typically a simplification in choosing the parameters of the analysis, in the sense that no embedding in multidimensional space is usually assumed and that recurrence is restricted to exact matching (equivalence) of the numerically coded categories. However, such a simplified parameterization brings about some notable changes in the appearance of the obtained Recurrence Plots, which has consequences for the extraction of the standard dynamical measures. Specifically, a categorical Recurrence Plot is often composed of rectangular structures rather than line structures (diagonal and horizontal/vertical), over which the recurrence quantification measures were originally proposed. Starting from this observation, I consider alternative computational procedures to extract a non-biased measure of entropy for the categorical case, showing the viability of such a choice with simulated data

AB  - Exposome-related data will come from a myriad of sources. The huge amounts of data must be organized in some manner that allows appropriate interpretations and associations to be drawn. Models and maps are often used to provide organization to complex data sets. Maps are quite appropriate for exposome research as the location of the sources and exposures is a critical component, and spatial statistics could play a major role in exposome data organization. The complex types of data will undoubtedly require mathematical approaches, including bioinformatics, computational, and systems biology-based techniques. This chapter reviews some of the possible strategies that can be used to keep track of the diverse and massive data sets that will result from exposome research.

AB  - Background
To describe the use of the combination of a conical custom-made TREO® (TREO CM) stent graft in the treatment of a saccular abdominal aortic endograft (AAA) with long but tight and calcified distal neck.
Materials and Methods
A 65-year-female patient was treated for a saccular 5.2 cm AAA with a 3-cm long but calcified and tight (16 mm) distal neck, precluding the safe use of a bifurcated endograft. Because the patient refused an open surgery, a conical TREO CM endograft was manufactured with 20% proximal oversizing, whereas the 3-cm caudal sealing segment demonstrated a conical configuration comprising a 2-cm and 1-cm nitinol-supported zones of 20% and 10% oversizing, respectively, to avoid excessive strain and incomplete expand at the most distal calcified area, leading ultimately to an insidious infolding and consequent type Ib endoleak. A 24 × 40 mm Treovance aortic cuff was centrally deployed resulting in a 30 mm overlap with the main endograft.
Results
After 6 months, there was complete sealing, and the AAA sac has been shrunk to 45 mm.
Conclusions
The use of a conical TREO CM endograft with a proximal cuff provides a firm fixation centrally and a sufficient distal sealing design in AAAs with calcified and tight distal aorta, constituting a reliable alternative to bifurcated endografts or aortouniliac configurations followed by crossover adjuncts.

AB  - Many social systems have a set of opposite interactions such as friend/enemy, cooperation/competition and support/opposition. In these signed systems, there exist functional imbalances from the system-level view because of the existence of unbalanced interactions. However, it is difficult to compute the unbalance degree and transform unbalanced factors to balanced ones in real signed systems. Earlier studies tackled these two issues separately and gave a unique solution, and thus cannot be well applied to real applications with constraints. In this paper, we devise a decomposition-based and network-specific multi-objective optimization algorithm to solve the balance computation and transformation of signed networks simultaneously. The devised algorithm aims at finding a set of optimal balance transformation solutions, and each of which is the trade-off between the twin objectives (i.e., the minimization of inter-cluster positive links and the minimization of intra-cluster negative links). Of these solutions, the one with the fewest unbalanced links corresponds to the solution to the balance computation. And each trade-off solution corresponds to an optimal balance transformation way under a certain transformation cost. Extensive experiments on four social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised algorithm on both the computation and the transformation of structural balance. They also show that the devised algorithm can provide multiple optimal solutions at the same transformation cost.

AB  - The purpose of this study is review and evaluation of computing methods used in genomic selection for animal breeding. Commonly used models include SNP BLUP with extensions (BayesA, etc), genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). These models are applied for genomewide association studies (GWAS), genomic prediction and parameter estimation. Solving methods include finite Cholesky decomposition possibly with a sparse implementation, and iterative Gauss–Seidel (GS) or preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), the last two methods possibly with iteration on data. Details are provided that can drastically decrease some computations. For SNP BLUP especially with sampling and large number of SNP, the only choice is GS with iteration on data and adjustment of residuals. If only solutions are required, PCG by iteration on data is a clear choice. A genomic relationship matrix (GRM) has limited dimensionality due to small effective population size, resulting in infinite number of generalized inverses of GRM for large genotyped populations. A specific inverse called APY requires only a small fraction of GRM, is sparse and can be computed and stored at a low cost for millions of animals. With APY inverse and PCG iteration, GBLUP and ssGBLUP can be applied to any population. Both tools can be applied to GWAS. When the system of equations is sparse but contains dense blocks, a recently developed package for sparse Cholesky decomposition and sparse inversion called YAMS has greatly improved performance over packages where such blocks were treated as sparse. With YAMS, GREML and possibly single-step GREML can be applied to populations with >50 000 genotyped animals. From a computational perspective, genomic selection is becoming a mature methodology.

AB  - The Matlab environment has become widely used among the computational mechanics community, not only for research purposes but also to teach either undergraduate or graduate classes. This paper aims to present a new toolbox devoted to computational mechanics and in particular to solid mechanics. Both recent and well-established numerical formulations have been implemented in it. One of its strengths resides in the fact that it was developed within an object-oriented framework. This key feature makes the CastLab toolbox easy-to-use and with extensive capabilities for customized user developments. After a brief description of the theoretical background related to the problems that can be solved by means of the toolbox, several representative case-studies are presented. These examples have been selected to illustrate not only the numerical efficiency of the toolbox, which is of primary importance for research purposes, but also its strong educational and pedagogic potential.

AB  - In this study, we apply a cognitive theoretical lens to investigate students’ opportunity to develop their analytic text-based writing skills (N = 35 fifth and sixth grade classrooms). Specifically, we examine the thinking demands of classroom text-based writing tasks and teachers’ written feedback on associated student work. Four text-based writing tasks with drafts of associated student work were collected from teachers across a school year. Results of qualitative analyses showed that about half of the classroom text-based writing tasks considered by teachers to be challenging guided students to express analytic thinking about what they read (n = 73). A minority of student work received written feedback focused on students’ use of evidence, expression of thinking, and text comprehension; or received feedback that provided guidance for strategies students could take to meet genre goals. Most teachers provided content-related, instructive, and/or localized feedback on at least one piece of student work. Only a small number of teachers, however, consistently provided content-related, instructive or localized feedback on their students’ essays. Overall, results suggest that students have few opportunities to practice analytic text-based writing and receive feedback that would be expected to advance their conceptual understanding and adaptive expertise for writing in this genre.

AB  - The intersection of mathematical cognition, metacognition, and advanced technologies presents a frontier with profound implications for human learning and artificial intelligence. This paper traces the historical roots of these concepts from the Pythagoreans and Aristotle to modern cognitive science and explores their relevance to contemporary technological applications. We examine how the Pythagoreans' view of mathematics as fundamental to understanding the universe and Aristotle's contributions to logic and categorization have shaped our current understanding of mathematical cognition and metacognition. The paper investigates the role of Boolean logic in computational processes and its relationship to human logical reasoning, as well as the significance of Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic in modelling uncertainty in human cognition and decision-making. We also explore the emerging field of Chemical Artificial Intelligence and its potential applications. We argue for unifying mathematical metacognition with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, while identifying the multifaceted benefits and challenges of such unification. The present paper examines essential research directions for integrating cognitive sciences and advanced technologies, discussing applications in education, healthcare, and business management. We provide suggestions for developing cognitive robots using specific cognitive tasks and explore the ethical implications of these advancements. Our analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to realize the full potential of this integration while mitigating potential risks.

AB  - In this chapter, we present what should be the inner structure of a decision algebra whose motivation is to fill a causal break induced by context invalidity to ultimately permit human-machine interactions. It turns out that such a decision structure can be qualified using the context change arrow as a disruptive process or as a phase transition according to the geometrical representation of computational contexts as double S-curves. In particular a computational context is always characterized by a shift between sense making and temporal causality. That is, once a causal break occurs, it has to be filled locally by a decision. A causal break is always continuous and never discrete; in effect, in the discrete case, combinatoric analysis causes unwanted complexity due to a lack of knowledge, whereas we need full knowledge thanks to a very precise semantic of a causal break. Intuitively, rather than separating brutally models and counter-models as a proof can do by setting a strong negation operator, we prefer to use the continuous inference as an implementation of sense making. Sense is that way taken as the rationality of the transition. Full knowledge requires a special structure, a Hopf algebra in which the continuous property we cannot implement is replaced by the computable co-continuous property in the co-algebraic component of the decision Hopf algebra. We hope that thanks to co-continuous structures and to co-dimensional exterior algebras, we’ll be able to find out a representation of the continuous inference able to compute a decision rather than admitting definitely and desperately that “such a mechanism is totally out of bounds” and will never ever concern a machine.

AB  - AI technology is reshaping language classrooms, prompting students to adopt flexible roles exhibiting linguistic competence and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.

AB  - The ubiquity of smartphone and tablet devices, combined with the increasing availability of serious games, has enabled students to learn various abstract concepts in an appealing and convenient manner. While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work.

AB  - Enactivism is a philosophical and scientific approach that emphasizes the role of the body and its interactions with the environment in shaping cognitive processes and subjective experiences. Meanwhile, osteopathy is a person-centered health care discipline, highlighting the structure-function interrelationship of the body and its selfregulation mechanisms. Both approaches value the body and the environment in health. Several authors have been discussing the urgent need for a reconceptualization of osteopathy and also suggesting integrate biological, psychological and social aspects. Thinking osteopathy as a Therapeutic Rationality, implies recognize its fundamental dimensions: Human Morphology, Vital Dynamics, Medical Doctrine, Diagnostic System and Therapeutic System, all integrated by a philosophical Cosmology, as the original term Medical rationality states, but also embrace a broader perspective allowing an individual and unique process of each person, reflecting the transformation of contemporary medicine to a person approach. Enactivism principles can serve as a basis for a reconceptualization of osteopathy, integrating environmental, psychological, social, and spiritual factors. Osteopathic concepts can probably be updated through the convergence between enactivism and osteopathy, promoting more meaningful and evidence-based clinical practice. Advancing in this direction requires a collaborative dialogue between researchers, health professionals and interested people, seeking an integrated understanding of the relationship between body, mind, environment and health.

AB  - Community databases have become crucial to the collection, ordering and retrieval of data gathered on model organisms, as well as to the ways in which these data are interpreted and used across a range of research contexts. This paper analyses the impact of community databases on research practices in model organism biology by focusing on the history and current use of four community databases: FlyBase, Mouse Genome Informatics, WormBase and The Arabidopsis Information Resource. We discuss the standards used by the curators of these databases for what counts as reliable evidence, acceptable terminology, appropriate experimental set-ups and adequate materials (e.g., specimens). On the one hand, these choices are informed by the collaborative research ethos characterising most model organism communities. On the other hand, the deployment of these standards in databases reinforces this ethos and gives it concrete and precise instantiations by shaping the skills, practices, values and background knowledge required of the database users. We conclude that the increasing reliance on community databases as vehicles to circulate data is having a major impact on how researchers conduct and communicate their research, which affects how they understand the biology of model organisms and its relation to the biology of other species.

AB  - This paper transfers a randomized algorithm, originally used in geometric optimization, to computational problems in commutative algebra. We show that Clarkson's sampling algorithm can be applied to two problems in computational algebra: solving large-scale polynomial systems and finding small generating sets of graded ideals. The cornerstone of our work is showing that the theory of violator spaces of Gärtner et al. applies to polynomial ideal problems. To show this, one utilizes a Helly-type result for algebraic varieties. The resulting algorithms have expected runtime linear in the number of input polynomials, making the ideas interesting for handling systems with very large numbers of polynomials, but whose rank in the vector space of polynomials is small (e.g., when the number of variables and degree is constant).
