AB  - Having no native energy resources of fossil fuels, with poor wind resource and scarcity of land, the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) roadmap identified solar electricity as the most feasible source of renewable energy for Singapore's energy mix and supply. Moving towards net-zero emissions and to combat climate change, the Singapore government is aiming to achieve 2-Gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar electricity target by 2030. Accordingly, the share of solar energy in the national grid is targeted to be between ∼2–6% in 2030 and ∼ 3.5–8% in 2040, and carbon emission savings to be ∼0.5–1.4 and ∼ 0.8–2.1 million tonnes per annum in 2030 and 2040 respectively. Although these ambitious targets align with the government's plans for mitigating emissions, Singapore faces great challenge in terms of land availability to install ground-mounted solar PV panels. In this paper, a system dynamics model is developed to study- to what extent can Singapore achieve the targeted solar electricity goals by 2030 or even beyond based on Green Plan 2030, what policies can be identified to achieve these targets, and how much carbon savings can be achieved through Solar electricity deployment. Accordingly, this paper presents systems thinking and system dynamics (ST&SD) methodology to model the growth of Singapore's solar capacity, carbon emission savings and share of electricity demand met by solar electricity while focusing on key complex factors such as area utilisation, subsidies, PV panel efficiency etc. Results of our model simulations and projections, based on the key data and assumptions, and policy scenarios show that Singapore's solar capacity can be accelerated by the implementation of the proposed policies to reach 2GWp goal towards 2030 or even slightly ahead of this timeline. However, should the government revise its solar capacity targets higher for the years past 2030 i.e. to achieve 8% share of total electricity generation, perhaps by 2040, policies such as an increased area utilisation, subsidies and higher panel efficiency need to be introduced. Our model simulations incorporating and evaluating these policy scenarios yielded the results aligning with the projections mentioned above. The results and insights presented in this paper offer useful recommendations to the researchers and policy makers in the field of solar electricity system in Singapore, and to study further for better policy making.

AB  - The paper establishes a conceptual and methodological link between destinations and simulacrum through gamified tourism. As a paradigm, gamified tourism provides a rationale and a setting within which to apply computational economics to tourism, an approach amounting to tourism computability. Algorithmic destinations serve as “petri dishes” for real destinations. Utilizing rule sets that embody destination growth dynamics and visitor behavioural norms, seeding points in a cellular automata model (CA) were grown into algorithmic destinations. This is followed by a morphological transformation of geo-tagged satellite images into spatial points. The overlap of this additive and subtractive approach is at the core of tourism computability. Finally, the spatio-temporal dynamics of economic resilience was traced out through a visual phenomenology of algorithmic destinations. The gamification of tourism should be embraced as it holds up a flicker of hope for mature destinations, amidst the onset of museumification and increased commoditization of heritage sites. Gamification is treated as part of the reflexive cycle for destination authenticity; a notion that that Cohen (1988) alluded to in his discussion of emergent authenticity in destination image formation. Seen in this light, the museumification of Venice and the proliferation of its simulacrum, such as the Venetian Hotel in Macao and Venice-themed hotels across the globe, are prefigures and archetypes of a glorious age of gamified tourism.

AB  - An intricate relation exists between gene trees and species phylogenies, due to evolutionary processes that act on the genes within and across the branches of the species phylogeny. From an analytical perspective, gene trees serve as character states for inferring accurate species phylogenies, and species phylogenies serve as a backdrop against which gene trees are contrasted for elucidating evolutionary processes and parameters. In a 1997 paper, Maddison discussed this relation, reviewed the signatures left by three major evolutionary processes on the gene trees, and surveyed parsimony and likelihood criteria for utilizing these signatures to elucidate computationally this relation. Here, I review progress that has been made in developing computational methods for analyses under these two criteria, and survey remaining challenges.

AB  - We propose that human social cognition is structured around a basic understanding of ourselves and others as intuitive utility maximizers: from a young age, humans implicitly assume that agents choose goals and actions to maximize the rewards they expect to obtain relative to the costs they expect to incur. This ‘naïve utility calculus’ allows both children and adults observe the behavior of others and infer their beliefs and desires, their longer-term knowledge and preferences, and even their character: who is knowledgeable or competent, who is praiseworthy or blameworthy, who is friendly, indifferent, or an enemy. We review studies providing support for the naïve utility calculus, and we show how it captures much of the rich social reasoning humans engage in from infancy.

AB  - Drainage networks determination from digital elevation models (DEM) has been a widely studied problem in the last three decades. During this time, satellite technology has been improving and optimizing digitalized images, and computers have been increasing their capabilities to manage such a huge quantity of information. The rapid growth of CPU power and memory size has concentrated the discussion of DEM algorithms on the accuracy of their results more than their running times. However, obtaining improved running times remains crucial when DEM dimensions and their resolutions increase. Parallel computation provides an opportunity to reduce run times. Recently developed graphics processing units (GPUs) are computationally fast not only in Computer Graphics but in General Purpose Computation, the so-called GPGPU. In this paper we explore the parallel characteristics of these GPUs for drainage network determination, using the C-oriented language of CUDA developed by NVIDIA. The results are simple algorithms that run on low-cost technology with a high performance response, obtaining CPU improvements of up to 8×.

AB  - There has been a recent flurry of activity in consciousness research. Although an operational definition of consciousness has not yet been developed, philosophy has come to identify a set of features and aspects that are thought to be associated with the various elements of consciousness. On the other hand, there have been several recent attempts to develop computational models of consciousness that are claimed to capture or illustrate one or more aspects of consciousness. As a plausible substitute to evaluating how well the current computational models model consciousness, this study examines how the current computational models fare in modeling those aspects and features of consciousness identified by philosophy. Following a review of the literature on the philosophy of consciousness, this study constructs a list of features and aspects that would be expected in any successful model of consciousness. The study then evaluates, from the viewpoint of that list, some of the current self-claimed and implemented computational models of consciousness. The computational models studied are evaluated with respect to each identified aspect and feature of consciousness.

AB  - The debate about the relationship between economic growth and environmental sustainability triggers a range of associations. Here we analyze open-ended textual responses of citizens and scientists concerning their associations with the terms “economic growth” and “green growth”. We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term “green growth”, we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability.

AB  - We extend the framework for complexity of operators in analysis devised by Kawamura and Cook (2012) to allow for the treatment of a wider class of representations. The main novelty is to endow represented spaces of interest with an additional function on names, called a parameter, which measures the complexity of a given name. This parameter generalises the size function which is usually used in second-order complexity theory and therefore also central to the framework of Kawamura and Cook. The complexity of an algorithm is measured in terms of its running time as a second-order function in the parameter, as well as in terms of how much it increases the complexity of a given name, as measured by the parameters on the input and output side. As an application we develop a rigorous computational complexity theory for interval computation. In the framework of Kawamura and Cook the representation of real numbers based on nested interval enclosures does not yield a reasonable complexity theory. In our new framework this representation is polytime equivalent to the usual Cauchy representation based on dyadic rational approximation. By contrast, the representation of continuous real functions based on interval enclosures is strictly smaller in the polytime reducibility lattice than the usual representation, which encodes a modulus of continuity. Furthermore, the function space representation based on interval enclosures is optimal in the sense that it contains the minimal amount of information amongst those representations which render evaluation polytime computable.

AB  - The k-method is the isogeometric method based on splines (or NURBS, etc.) with maximum regularity. When implemented following the paradigms of classical finite element methods, the computational resources required by the k-method are prohibitive even for moderate degree. In order to address this issue, we propose a matrix-free strategy combined with weighted quadrature, which is an ad-hoc strategy to compute the integrals of the Galerkin system. Matrix-free weighted quadrature (MF-WQ) speeds up matrix operations, and, perhaps even more important, greatly reduces memory consumption. Our strategy also requires an efficient preconditioner for the linear system iterative solver. In this work we deal with an elliptic model problem, and adopt a preconditioner based on the Fast Diagonalization method, an old idea to solve Sylvester-like equations. Our numerical tests show that the isogeometric solver based on MF-WQ is faster than standard approaches (where the main cost is the matrix formation by standard Gaussian quadrature) even for low degree. But the main achievement is that, with MF-WQ, the k-method gets orders of magnitude faster by increasing the degree, given a target accuracy. Therefore, we are able to show the superiority, in terms of computational efficiency, of the high-degree k-method with respect to low-degree isogeometric discretizations. What we present here is applicable to more complex and realistic differential problems, but its effectiveness will depend on the preconditioner stage, which is as always problem-dependent. This situation is typical of modern high-order methods: the overall performance is mainly related to the quality of the preconditioner.

AB  - This paper aimed at constructing a systematic framework and examining the effect of gamification in programming education through a meta-analysis conducted on 21 empirical studies published in the last decade. We examined the effects of game types, gamification applications, pedagogical agents, programming types, and schooling levels on students' academic achievement, cognitive load, motivation, and thinking skills in programming education by cross-tabulation analysis. Results verified the positive impact of gamification in programming education. Gamification has the largest effect on students' motivation, followed by academic achievement, whereas it has the least effect on students' cognitive load. As for game types, the reasoning strategy game is most effective on academic achievement, while the puzzle game is most effective on motivation. As for gamification application, the games as a competitive mechanism has the greatest impact on students’ thinking skills and motivation. However, when games were adopted as teaching tools or student works, the effects are mainly represented in academic achievement. Pedagogical agents have a limited effect on programming education. With regard to programming types, the effect of gamification is more pronounced in text-based programming rather than graphical programming. This study provided an analytic framework and shed light on potential directions for further studies in the field.

On the basis of the defined general mode framework, agents of the algorithms in a nature-inspired computation field can show a type of uniform intelligent computation mode.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often targeted using a model of TMS-induced electric field (E). In such navigated TMS, the E-field models have been based on spherical approximation of the head. Such models omit the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gyral folding, leading to potentially large errors in the computed E-field. So far, realistic models have been too slow for interactive TMS navigation. We present computational methods that enable real-time solving of the E-field in a realistic five-compartment (5-C) head model that contains isotropic white matter, gray matter, CSF, skull and scalp. Using reciprocity and Geselowitz integral equation, we separate the computations to coil-dependent and -independent parts. For the Geselowitz integrals, we present a fast numerical quadrature. Further, we present a moment-matching approach for optimizing dipole-based coil models. We verified and benchmarked the new methods using simulations with over 100 coil locations. The new quadrature introduced a relative error (RE) of 0.3–0.6%. For a coil model with 42 dipoles, the total RE of the quadrature and coil model was 0.44–0.72%. Taking also other model errors into account, the contribution of the new approximations to the RE was 0.1%. For comparison, the RE due to omitting the separation of white and gray matter was >11%, and the RE due to omitting also the CSF was >23%. After the coil-independent part of the model has been built, E-fields can be computed very quickly: Using a standard PC and basic GPU, our solver computed the full E-field in a 5-C model in 9000 points on the cortex in 27 coil positions per second (cps). When the separation of white and gray matter was omitted, the speed was 43–65 cps. Solving only one component of the E-field tripled the speed. The presented methods enable real-time solving of the TMS-induced E-field in a realistic head model that contains the CSF and gyral folding. The new methodology allows more accurate targeting and precise adjustment of stimulation intensity during experimental or clinical TMS mapping.

AB  - Quantum computational logics are special examples of quantum logic where formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information (qubit-systems or mixtures of qubit-systems), while logical connectives are interpreted as reversible quantum logical gates. Hence, any formula of the quantum computational language represents a synthetic logical description of a quantum circuit. We investigate a many-valued approach to quantum information, where the basic notion of qubit has been replaced by the more general notion of qudit. The qudit-semantics allows us to represent as reversible gates some basic logical operations of Łukasiewicz many-valued logics. In the final part of the article we discuss some problems that concern possible implementations of gates by means of optical devices.

AB  - The Less is More hypothesis suggests that one reason adults and children differ in their ability to learn language is that they also differ in other cognitive capacities. According to one version of this hypothesis, children’s relatively poor memory may make them more likely to regularize inconsistent input (Hudson Kam and Newport, 2005, Hudson Kam and Newport, 2009). This paper reports the result of an experimental and computational investigation of one aspect of this version of the hypothesis. A series of seven experiments in which adults were placed under a high cognitive load during a language-learning task reveal that in adults, increased load during learning (as opposed to retrieval) does not result in increased regularization. A computational model offers a possible explanation for these results. It demonstrates that, unless memory limitations distort the data in a particular way, regularization should occur only in the presence of both memory limitations and a prior bias for regularization. Taken together, these findings suggest that the difference in regularization between adults and children may not be solely attributable to differences in memory limitations during learning.

AB  - The present paper applies the logic of John Kenneth Gailbraith's institutional economics analysis of corporate power to inquiring into the societal role of the nonprofit sector. Building on Galbraith's insight that corporations cause subtle but pervasive societal imbalances, the paper locates the role of nonprofit organizations in compensating for these imbalances, thus showing corporations and nonprofit organizations to be mutually complementary rather than antagonistic actors. This argument is supported by Niklas Luhmann's vision of the precarious relationship between the complexity and sustainability of social systems as well as by Kenneth Boulding's analysis of the farmer and labor movement. Luhmann's and Boulding's perspectives show profit-seeking corporations to be social systems developing high technological complexity at the cost of sacrificing their societal sustainability, while the improvement of the latter constitutes the rationale of many nonprofit organizations. The same systems-theoretic logic suggests, however, that nonprofit organizations may tend to underestimate the technological complexity of implementing their mission-related activities, thereby undermining their own effectiveness.

AB  - Intuition is the human capacity to make decisions under novel, complex situations where knowledge is incomplete and of variable levels of certainty. We take the view that intuition can be modeled as a rational and deductive mode of information processing which is suited to novel, complex situations. In this research, a computational algorithm, or “intuitive reasoner”, is proposed which mimics some aspects of human intuition by combining established mathematical tools, such as fuzzy set theory, and some novel innovations. A rule-based scheme is followed and a rule-learning module that allows rules to be learned from incomplete datasets is developed. The input and the rules drawn by the reasoner are allowed to be fuzzy, multi-valued, and low in certainty. A measure of the certainty level, Strength of Belief, is attached to each input as well as each rule. Solutions are formulated through iterations of consolidating intermediate reasoning results, during which the Strength of Belief of corroborating intermediate results is combined. An experimental implementation of the proposed intuitive reasoner is reported, in which the reasoner was used to solve a classification problem. The results showed that, when given increasingly sparse input data, the rule-learning module generated more rules of lower associated certainty than when presented with more complete data. The intuitive reasoner was able to make use of these low-certainty rules to solve the classification problems with an accuracy that compared favorably to that of traditional methods based on complete datasets.

AB  - Cognitive neuroscientists sometimes apply formal models to investigate how the brain implements cognitive processes. These models describe behavioral data in terms of underlying, latent variables linked to hypothesized cognitive processes. A goal of model-based cognitive neuroscience is to link these variables to brain measurements, which can advance progress in both cognitive and neuroscientific research. However, the details and the philosophical approach for this linking problem can vary greatly. We propose a continuum of approaches that differ in the degree of tight, quantitative, and explicit hypothesizing. We describe this continuum using four points along it, which we dub qualitative structural, qualitative predictive, quantitative predictive, and single model linking approaches. We further illustrate by providing examples from three research fields (decision making, reinforcement learning, and symbolic reasoning) for the different linking approaches.

We show that under some assumptions an approximate Dirichlet domain can work equally well as an exact Dirichlet domain. In particular, we consider a problem of tiling a hyperbolic ball with copies of the Dirichlet domain. This problem arises in the construction of the length spectrum algorithm which is implemented by the computer program SnapPea. Our result explains the empirical fact that the program works surprisingly well despite it does not use exact data. Also we demonstrate a rigorous verification whether two words of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold are the same or not.

AB  - Sweden's pulp and paper sector accounts for a significant proportion of national energy usage, besides generating wastewater that causes eutrophication of nearby sinks. In this paper, the possibility of optimizing biological wastewater treatment at the Stora Enso Skoghall mill south of the city of Karlstad in central Sweden, with respect to electricity usage and the addition of nutrients, has been investigated. A computational model of the treatment process was developed, based on process data obtained from the said mill, and nine different scenarios were compared subsequently, with energy use, environmental impacts and operational expenses, as criteria. The most energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative was a combination of measures such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR (Moving Bed Bio-Reactor) from 3 mg/l to 2 mg/l and using the Hyperclassic aerator in the aerated lagoon. This arrangement yielded a 48.5 % reduction in operational expenses, and a 60 % decrease in the energy use, vis-à-vis the reference case, without affecting the efficiency of the treatment process. This also uncovered an opportunity to mitigate the annual global warming and eutrophication impacts, by approximately 100 tons CO2-eq. and 140 kg PO43−-eq. respectively. All attempts to optimise the use of resources and decrease the anthropogenic environmental footprint ought to be made to come closer to the targets set by the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs). The authors' conclusion predicated on the results of the modelling and analysis done in this study is that the potential of seemingly small process modifications, such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR, and applying a more optimal dosage of nutrient salts, must not be overlooked by wastewater treatment plants in general (and those in pulp and paper mills in particular).

Here, we propose reinforcement learning (RL) as a unified framework to dissect the political mind. RL describes how agents algorithmically navigate complex and uncertain domains like politics. Through this computational lens, we outline three routes to political differences, stemming from variability in agents’ conceptions of a problem, the cognitive operations applied to solve the problem, or the backdrop of information available from the environment. A computational vantage on maladies of the political mind offers enhanced precision in assessing their causes, consequences, and cures.

AB  - Summary
Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent two differing paradigms for the analysis of data. Frequentism became the dominant mode of statistical thinking in medical practice during the 20th century. The advent of modern computing has made Bayesian analysis increasingly accessible, enabling growing use of Bayesian methods in a range of disciplines, including medical research. Rather than conceiving of probability as the expected frequency of an event (purported to be measurable and objective), Bayesian thinking conceives of probability as a measure of strength of belief (an explicitly subjective concept). Bayesian analysis combines previous information (represented by a mathematical probability distribution, the prior) with information from the study (the likelihood function) to generate an updated probability distribution (the posterior) representing the information available for clinical decision making. Owing to its fundamentally different conception of probability, Bayesian statistics offers an intuitive, flexible, and informative approach that facilitates the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. In this Review, we provide a brief account of the philosophical and methodological differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches and survey the use of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of clinical research.

AB  - Doping remains an intractable issue in sport and occurs in a complex and dynamic environment comprising interactions between individual, situational, and environmental factors. Anti-doping efforts have previously predominantly focused on athlete behaviours and sophisticated detection methods, however, doping issues remain. As such, there is merit in exploring an alternative approach. The aim of this study was to apply a systems thinking approach to model the current anti-doping system for four football codes in Australia, using the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). The STAMP control structure was developed and validated by eighteen subject matter experts across a five-phase validation process. Within the developed model, education was identified as a prominent approach anti-doping authorities use to combat doping. Further, the model suggests that a majority of existing controls are reactive, and hence that there is potential to employ leading indicators to proactively prevent doping and that new incident reporting systems could be developed to capture such information. It is our contention that anti-doping research and practice should consider a shift away from the current reactive and reductionist approach of detection and enforcement to a proactive and systemic approach focused on leading indicators. This will provide anti-doping agencies a new lens to look at doping in sport.

AB  - Much of the rich internal world constructed by humans is derived from, and experienced through, visual mental imagery. Despite growing appreciation of visual exploration in guiding episodic memory processes, extant theories of prospection have yet to accommodate the precise role of visual mental imagery in the service of future-oriented thinking. We propose that the construction of future events relies on the assimilation of perceptual details originally experienced, and subsequently reinstantiated, predominantly in the visual domain. Individual differences in the capacity to summon discrete aspects of visual imagery can therefore account for the diversity of content generated by humans during future simulation. Our integrative framework provides a novel testbed to query alterations in future thinking in health and disease.

KW  - Material behavior
KW  - Spring-based simulation
KW  - Computational design
KW  - Biomimetic research
AB  - Research in material behavior involves the study of relationships between material composition and capacities to negotiate internal and external pressures. Tuning material composition for performance allows for the integration of multifaceted functionality and embedded responsiveness within minimal material means. The relationships of material composition and system performance can be dissected into properties of topology (in count, type and association), forces (as the simulation of contextual pressures), and materiality (material properties and constraints of fabrication). When resourcing information about these aspects of material behavior from biological or technological systems, the physical precedents, as specimens and/or models, serve as the primary, and often sole, exemplar. While this is necessary to initiate the study of material make-up as it relates to specific morphological performance, there is an inherent limit when asking how and to what degree the knowledge resourced from that instance applies when alterations from the norm are generated. This research proposes the possibility for testing variants of a morphological system using physical models as the precedent while incorporating multiple means of computational analysis for extensive exploration. The framework begins with the initial stage of deducing principles, regarding material organization and behavior, through comparative physical and computational study. Subsequently, through methods of abduction, new vocabularies of form and potentials in performance are generated primarily through computational exploration. The framework is shaped by research into the design and materialization of complex pre-stressed form- and bending-active architectures. A novel aspect of this framework is the development of a software environment called springFORM. In this environment, material behavior is simulated using basic spring-based (particle system) methods. The novel contribution of this software is in providing means for both manual and algorithmic manipulations of mesh topologies and material properties during the form-finding process. A series of architectural prototypes, which range in scale, define rules for the relationship between topological-material complexity and the sequencing of particular exploratory methods. The studies define the value of the physical precedent as it engenders further material prototypes, spring-based explorations and simulations with finite element analysis. These rules and methods are further elaborated upon through studying the particularly fascinating structural capacity of banana leaf stalks, a material system which is stiff in bending yet highly flexible in torsion. Of interest is a functional robustness which allows for the negotiation of both self-weight and wind loading for a large and fully integrated leaf structure. Methods of simulation and meta-heuristics are developed to address the continual material and topological differentiation of the banana leaf stalk. Case studies are based upon examination of specimens from the species Musa acuminata and Ensete ventricosum. Mechanical properties and geometric descriptions of isolated moments within the stalk provide the basis for computational comparison. Fundamental properties and behaviors are extracted from the plant specimens, yet a full description is not possible because of the plant’s intricate spatial structure. In this case, the computational means serve to elucidate upon the behavior of the complete system as well as provide avenues for exploring its variants. This paper describes an extensible and calibrated framework which can foster enhanced biomimetic insights by explorations which are based upon but extend well beyond initial biological and/or technological precedents.

AB  - How can the same underlying psychological/neurobiological system result in both stable between-individual differences and high levels of within-individual variability in personality states over time and situations? We argue that both types of variability result from a psychological system based on structured, chronic motivations, where behavior at a specific point in time is a joint function of the current availability of motive affordances in the situation, current motivationally relevant bodily or interoceptive states, and the result of the competition among alternative active motives. Here we present a biologically-based theoretical framework, embodied in two different computational models, that shows how individuals with stable personality characteristics, can nevertheless exhibit considerable within-person variability in personality states across time and situations.

This review focuses on feeding-promoting cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that express the vesicular GABA and glycine transporter (vgat) as a model to further understand the impact of REM sleep on neural encoding of goal-directed behavior. It emphasizes both spatial and temporal aspects of hypothalamic cell dynamics across awake behaviors and REM sleep, and discusses a role for REM sleep in brain plasticity underlying energy homeostasis and behavioral optimization.

AB  - Considerable cost and effort are invested in government and private-sector activities aimed at providing a societally tolerable level of fire safety of the built environment. This is particularly true with respect to fire safety of new building construction. On the government side, this includes activities associated with building and fire regulations, material performance and test standards, design guidance, competency requirements, review and approvals, and more. On the private side, activities include product development, analysis and design, construction and installation, as well as education and training of practitioners. In some cases there are overlaps (e.g., private building control). However, once buildings become occupied, the system faces several challenges. Oversight of building use and modification often gets lost. Different actors come into play. Competing objectives become more significant. Occupants often lack understanding and ability to recognize problems and make adjustments. The net result is an increase in fire safety risk over the life of a building, with less opportunities for the regulatory system to make interventions prior to an unwanted fire event. However, this can be changed if the approach to regulating existing buildings changes, and importantly, embodies whole-of-life, multi-agency, holistic, systems-based thinking.

AB  - We propose a new approach for multiverse analysis based on computational complexity, which leads to a new family of “computational” measure factors. By defining a cosmology as a space–time containing a vacuum with specified properties (for example small cosmological constant) together with rules for how time evolution will produce the vacuum, we can associate global time in a multiverse with clock time on a supercomputer which simulates it. We argue for a principle of “limited computational complexity” governing early universe dynamics as simulated by this supercomputer, which translates to a global measure for regulating the infinities of eternal inflation. The rules for time evolution can be thought of as a search algorithm, whose details should be constrained by a stronger principle of “minimal computational complexity”. Unlike previously studied global measures, ours avoids standard equilibrium considerations and the well-known problems of Boltzmann Brains and the youngness paradox. We also give various definitions of the computational complexity of a cosmology, and argue that there are only a few natural complexity classes.

AB  - We propose a new heuristic algorithm to improve the computational efficiency of the general class of Multi-Echelon Technique for Recoverable Item Control (METRIC) problems. The objective of a METRIC-based decision problem is to systematically determine the location and quantity of spares that either maximizes the operational availability of a system subject to a budget constraint or minimizes its cost subject to an operational availability target. This type of sparing analysis has proven essential when analyzing the sustainment policies of large-scale, complex repairable systems such as those prevalent in the defense and aerospace industries. Additionally, the frequency of these sparing studies has recently increased as the adoption of performance-based logistics (PBL) has increased. PBL represents a class of business strategies that converts the recurring cost associated with maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) into cost avoidance streams. Central to a PBL contract is a requirement to perform a business case analysis (BCA) and central to a BCA is the frequent need to use METRIC-based approaches to evaluate how a supplier and customer will engage in a performance based logistics arrangement where spares decisions are critical. Due to the size and frequency of the problem there exists a need to improve the efficiency of the computationally intensive METRIC-based solutions. We develop and validate a practical algorithm for improving the computational efficiency of a METRIC-based approach. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are analyzed through a numerical study. The algorithm shows a 94% improvement in computational efficiency while maintaining 99.9% accuracy.

AB  - A defining aspect of being human is an ability to reason about the world by generating and adapting ideas and hypotheses. Here we explore how this ability develops by comparing children’s and adults’ active search and explicit hypothesis generation patterns in a task that mimics the open-ended process of scientific induction. In our experiment, 54 children (aged 8.97±1.11) and 50 adults performed inductive inferences about a series of causal rules through active testing. Children were more elaborate in their testing behavior and generated substantially more complex guesses about the hidden rules. We take a ‘computational constructivist’ perspective to explaining these patterns, arguing that these inferences are driven by a combination of thinking (generating and modifying symbolic concepts) and exploring (discovering and investigating patterns in the physical world). We show how this framework and rich new dataset speak to questions about developmental differences in hypothesis generation, active learning and inductive generalization. In particular, we find children’s learning is driven by less fine-tuned construction mechanisms than adults’, resulting in a greater diversity of ideas but less reliable discovery of simple explanations.

The present study describes the simulation approach using an open-source process simulator with the help of three simulation-based exercises. The first one exemplifies the importance of the selection of an appropriate fluid package. The second exercise presented in the study shows the effect of using optimized and default values of binary interaction parameters on VLE prediction of alcohol-ester systems. The small interactive simulation-based problems with expected outcomes were presented in the third exercise which makes the learning more engaging and interesting. The current study highlights an integrative approach to inculcating critical thinking and self-learning abilities using small simulation-based exercises while learning chemical engineering thermodynamics. Finally, a survey with closed- and open-ended questions was used to gather the opinions of students on the presented exercises. A short communication is needed that sheds light on the integrative approach of learning process simulation complementing the thermodynamic theory learning.

AB  - Summary
Decision-making is a cognitive process of central importance for the quality of our lives. Here, we ask whether a common factor underpins our diverse decision-making abilities. We obtained 32 decision-making measures from 830 young people and identified a common factor that we call “decision acuity,” which was distinct from IQ and reflected a generic decision-making ability. Decision acuity was decreased in those with aberrant thinking and low general social functioning. Crucially, decision acuity and IQ had dissociable brain signatures, in terms of their associated neural networks of resting-state functional connectivity. Decision acuity was reliably measured, and its relationship with functional connectivity was also stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later. Thus, our behavioral and brain data identify a new cognitive construct that underpins decision-making ability across multiple domains. This construct may be important for understanding mental health, particularly regarding poor social function and aberrant thought patterns.

AB  - Recent studies from sociocultural perspectives have explored the effects of Concept-based Language Instruction (C-BLI) on L2 development through the explicit teaching of scientific concepts. However, there has been little research into the effects of C-BLI on the development of L2 academic literacy. This article reports on a case study of how C-BLI mediated a Chinese doctoral student's development of conceptual knowledge of context and subsequent context-specific performance in academic writing. Drawing on data from writing tutorials and interviews, the learner's drafts and invited comments, and think-aloud protocols, the study revealed that the C-BLI interventions that integrated symbolic and dialogic mediation helped the learner attain and enhance awareness of contextual components. The learner appropriated the concept as a tool for thinking in judging appropriateness of rules of thumb and choices of exclusive discourse features in specific contexts of use, which consequently mediated his planning for writing and resulted in the development of performance. The study demonstrates the potential of C-BLI as a driving force for the development of conceptual knowledge and context-specific performance in the academic literacy of L2 learners. It has pedagogical implications for curriculum design, C-BLI-informed literacy and concept-based materials, and teacher development to stimulate teacher awareness in C-BLI.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with approximately 6–7 million people infected worldwide, becoming a public health problem in tropical countries, thus generating an increasing demand for the development of more effective drugs, due to the low efficiency of the existing drugs. Aiming at the development of a new antichagasic pharmacological tool, the density functional theory was used to calculate the reactivity descriptors of amentoflavone, a biflavonoid with proven anti-trypanosomal activity in vitro, as well as to perform a study of interactions with the enzyme cruzain, an enzyme key in the evolutionary process of T-cruzi. Structural properties (in solvents with different values of dielectric constant), the infrared spectrum, the frontier orbitals, Fukui analysis, thermodynamic properties were the parameters calculated from DFT method with the monomeric structure of the apigenin used for comparison. Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed to assess the potential use of this biflavonoid as a pharmacological antichagasic tool. The frontier orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) study to find the band gap of compound has been extended to calculate electron affinity, ionization energy, electronegativity electrophilicity index, chemical potential, global chemical hardness and global chemical softness to study the chemical behaviour of compound. The optimized structure was subjected to molecular Docking to characterize the interaction between amentoflavone and cruzain enzyme, a classic pharmacological target for substances with anti-gas activity, where significant interactions were observed with amino acid residues from each one's catalytic sites enzyme. These results suggest that amentoflavone has the potential to interfere with the enzymatic activity of cruzain, thus being an indicative of being a promising antichagasic agent.

AB  - Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a significant task for discovering frequent patterns in data mining. It has achieved great success in a plethora of applications such as market basket, computer networks, recommendation systems, and healthcare. In the past few years, evolutionary computation-based ARM has emerged as one of the most popular research areas for addressing the high computation time of traditional ARM. Although numerous papers have been published, there is no comprehensive analysis of existing evolutionary ARM methodologies. In this paper, we review emerging research of evolutionary computation for ARM. We discuss the applications on evolutionary computations for different types of ARM approaches including numerical rules, fuzzy rules, high-utility itemsets, class association rules, and rare association rules. Evolutionary ARM algorithms were classified into four main groups in terms of the evolutionary approach, including evolution-based, swarm intelligence-based, physics-inspired, and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the remaining challenges of evolutionary ARM and discuss its applications and future topics.

We describe three ongoing research programs that strive toward these goals: (i) studying narratives as a cognitive and social representation used to guide decision-making; (ii) building cognitively informed agent-based models; and (iii) understanding markets as an extended mind – the Market Mind Hypothesis – analyzed using the concepts, methods, and tools of Coordination Dynamics.

This review examines recent growth of research interest in the phenomenon, which has broadly supported a theoretical model in which IS is a functional language process that can confer benefits for cognition in a range of domains. A key insight to have emerged in recent years is that IS is an embodied experience characterized by varied subjective qualities, which can be usefully modeled in artificial systems and whose neural signals have the potential to be decoded through advancing brain–computer interface technologies. Challenges for future research include understanding individual differences in IS and mapping form to function across IS subtypes.

AB  - The new E.U. proposal for a general data protection regulation has been introduced to give an answer to the challenges of the evolving digital environment. In some cases, these expectations could be disappointed, since the proposal is still based on the traditional main pillars of the last generation of data protection laws. In the field of consumer data protection, these pillars are the purpose specification principle, the use limitation principle and the “notice and consent” model. Nevertheless, the complexity of data processing, the power of modern analytics and the “transformative” use of personal information drastically limit the awareness of consumers, their capability to evaluate the various consequences of their choices and to give a free and informed consent. To respond to the above, it is necessary to clarify the rationale of the “notice and consent” paradigm, looking back to its origins and assessing its effectiveness in a world of predictive analytics. From this perspective, the paper considers the historical evolution of data protection and how the fundamental issues coming from the technological and socio-economic contexts have been addressed by regulations. On the basis of this analysis, the author suggests a revision of the “notice and consent” model focused on the opt-in and proposes the adoption of a different approach when, such as in Big Data collection, the data subject cannot be totally aware of the tools of analysis and their potential output. For this reason, the author sustains the provision of a subset of rules for Big Data analytics, which is based on a multiple impact assessment of data processing, on a deeper level of control by data protection authorities, and on the different opt-out model.

AB  - Debates about freedom of will and action and their connections with moral responsibility have raged for centuries, but the opposing sides might disagree because they use different concepts of freedom. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that people who assert freedom in a determined (D) or counterfactual-intervener (CI) scenario assert this because they are thinking about freedom from constraint and not about freedom from determination (in D) or from inevitability (in CI). We also hypothesized that people who deny that freedom in D or in CI deny this because they are thinking about freedom from determination or from inevitability, respectively, and not about freedom from constraint. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two main online studies. Study I supported our hypotheses that people who deny freedom in D and CI are thinking about freedom from determinism and from inevitability, respectively, but these participants seemed to think about freedom from constraint when they were later considering modified scenarios where acts were not determined or inevitable. Study II investigated a contrary bypassing hypothesis that those who deny freedom in D denied this because they took determinism to exclude mental causation and hence to exclude freedom from constraint. We found that participants who took determinism to exclude freedom generally did not deny causation by mental states, here represented by desires and decisions. Their responses regarding causation by desires and decisions at most weakly mediated the relation between determinism and freedom or responsibility among this subgroup of our participants. These results speak against the bypassing hypothesis and in favor of our hypothesis that these participants were not thinking about freedom from constraint.

AB  - The optimal stenting technique for coronary artery bifurcations is still debated. With additional advances computational simulations can soon be used to compare stent designs or strategies based on verified structural and hemodynamics results in order to identify the optimal solution for each individual’s anatomy. In this study, patient-specific simulations of stent deployment were performed for 2 cases to replicate the complete procedure conducted by interventional cardiologists. Subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were conducted to quantify hemodynamic quantities linked to restenosis. Patient-specific pre-operative models of coronary bifurcations were reconstructed from CT angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Plaque location and composition were estimated from OCT and assigned to models, and structural simulations were performed in Abaqus. Artery geometries after virtual stent expansion of Xience Prime or Nobori stents created in SolidWorks were compared to post-operative geometry from OCT and CT before being extracted and used for CFD simulations in SimVascular. Inflow boundary conditions based on body surface area, and downstream vascular resistances and capacitances were applied at branches to mimic physiology. Artery geometries obtained after virtual expansion were in good agreement with those reconstructed from patient images. Quantitative comparison of the distance between reconstructed and post-stent geometries revealed a maximum difference in area of 20.4%. Adverse indices of wall shear stress were more pronounced for thicker Nobori stents in both patients. These findings verify structural analyses of stent expansion, introduce a workflow to combine software packages for solid and fluid mechanics analysis, and underscore important stent design features from prior idealized studies. The proposed approach may ultimately be useful in determining an optimal choice of stent and position for each patient.

AB  - Within the domain of psychology, Optimal Experimental Design (OED) principles have been used to model how people seek and evaluate information. Despite proving valuable as computational-level methods to account for people’s behaviour, their descriptive and explanatory powers remain largely unexplored. In a series of experiments, we used a naturalistic crime investigation scenario to examine how people evaluate queries, as well as outcomes, in probabilistic contexts. We aimed to uncover the psychological strategies that people use, not just to assess whether they deviated from OED principles. In addition, we explored the adaptiveness of the identified strategies across both one-shot and stepwise information search tasks. We found that people do not always evaluate queries strictly in OED terms and use distinct strategies, such as by identifying a leading contender at the outset. Moreover, we identified aspects of zero-sum thinking and risk aversion that interact with people’s information search strategies. Our findings have implications for building a descriptive account of information seeking and evaluation, accounting for factors that currently lie outside the realm of information-theoretic OED measures, such as context and the learner’s own preferences.

AB  - The high utility and usability of paper sticky notes support workflows and social dynamics of collaborative design activities and methods like affinity diagramming. In this chapter, we show how these natural collaboration activities can be blended with computational power by applying our framework Blended Interaction for a case study on affinity diagramming. Based on four domains of design, we embed our design solutions in a specific physical environment, preserve workflows, and emphasize individual and social interaction. Our proposed design solution to augment sticky notes with digital power blends the benefits of physical materials with the digital power of interactive surfaces, tangibles, and digital pens in an outstanding way. We hope that our design solutions inspire other researchers and practitioners to find innovative solutions that carefully blend real-world practices with the power of digital computing.

AB  - The evolution of the genome has led to very sophisticated and complex regulation. Because of the abundance of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the cell, different species will promiscuously associate with each other, suggesting collective dynamics similar to artificial neural networks. A simple mechanism is proposed allowing ncRNA to perform computations equivalent to neural network algorithms such as Boltzmann machines and the Hopfield model. The quantities analogous to the neural couplings are the equilibrium constants between different RNA species. The relatively rapid equilibration of RNA binding and unbinding is regulated by a slower process that degrades and creates new RNA. The model requires that the creation rate for each species be an increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms have already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the overall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to store many different patterns, or many different input–output relations. The network is also quite insensitive to random mutations in equilibrium constants. Therefore one expects that this kind of mechanism will have a much higher mutation rate than ones typically regarded as being under evolutionary constraint.

AB  - The ability to acquire, remember and use information about locations of objects in one’s proximal surrounding is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we present a computational model of this ability. The model provides a possible explanation of contradictory results from experimental psychology related to this ability, namely explanation of why some experiments have reproduced the so-called “disorientation effect” while others have failed to do so. Additionally, in contrast to other computational models of various aspects of spatial cognition, our model is integrated within an intelligent virtual agent. Thus, on a more general level, this paper also demonstrates that it is possible to use intelligent virtual agents as a powerful research tool in computational cognitive sciences.

AB  - The discussion of enhancing entrepreneurial competence in Higher Education Institution (HEI), especially in engineering and computing major, has increased for the recent years. This study aims to propose and test a structural model of relationship of Indonesian HEI entrepreneurship education with entrepreneurship competence to assess student entrepreneurship competences especially in undergraduate level. Thus, this study provides the contribution in this stream by creating a subject specialized that fit with specific study program to enhance entrepreneurial competence for freshmen student called Integrative Survival Experience especially in engineering and computing major. We measure its output by using EntreComp questionnaires framework from European Commission. A combination of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and neural network was implemented as analytic approach in this study. The results show that the freshmen engineering and computing students develop entrepreneurial competence by enhancing the specific sets of ideas and opportunities as well as the capability to manage resources for taking the action afterwards. Apparently, the entrepreneurial competence development process of engineering and computing students differs with that of business and management students.

AB  - Historical data indicate that tunnel fires often cause casualties and damage to both vehicles and tunnels. These severe consequences suggest that (1) humans seldom effectively learn from history, and (2) people lack optimal safety response strategies for tunnel fires. To investigate the root causes of accidental tunnel fires and learn from them, we first surveyed the literature on historical tunnel accidents and described the common timeline of accidental tunnel fires. We employed systems thinking, based on the past research, to depict a causal loop diagram of common accidental tunnel fires. We arrived at the following three findings: (1) the literature review proved that the causes of tunnel fires are far more complex than other types of fires, and the damage they generate is greater; (2) in the context of systems thinking, accidental tunnel fires involve many causal relationships which are both continuous and dynamic, including at least three systems, namely vehicles, tunnel control, and safety response; (3) the mental models “the experience of the operators at the tunnel operation control center is just as vital as the safety response” and “safety is more critical than the traffic volume in the tunnel”, can strengthen safety response systems and ensure safe driving in tunnels. Although the structure of each tunnel and the characteristics of each fire differ and present different causal relationships, this study elucidated lessons from accidental tunnel fires and provided required messages for establishing effective safety measures. The results of this study can be used to establish systems thinking models of tunnel fires and can serve as a reference for policy planning and establishing standard operating procedures for safety responses.

AB  - This article presents two numerical procedures to speed up computations when dealing with a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver based on the Volume of Fluid (VoF) or multifluid method to treat the free surface. The first one is a time-splitting procedure for the volume fraction equation, enabling the use of larger time steps for the resolution of the flow, without penalizing accuracy. However, these large time steps destabilize the coupling with the ship motion simulation when computing a dynamic equilibrium position in marine applications. The second procedure is therefore a quasi-static approach to solve the coupled problem of dynamic equilibrium. A comparison of these procedures with classical simulations shows that numerical solutions of realistic problems can be obtained up to four times faster.

AB  - A framework is proposed for facilitating the exploration process during the early design phase through computational sketch synthesis and interactive 3D reconstruction. In that phase, designers concentrate on developing concepts through numerous alternatives. Therefore, they constantly sketch so that they can rapidly visualize their ideas. Recently, the design industry has attempted to streamline the design process by implementing 3D model generation in the early design phase so that ideas may be more thoroughly explored, thus improving concept and final design conformance; however, efficiency issues have arisen. In this study, a 3D computational sketch synthesis framework was developed comprising two major components. First, a robust method was proposed to synthesize design alternatives by interpolating an input sketch with sketches in a database so that unvisited combinations may be explored. Secondly, a novel interactive 3D model reconstruction method was developed to facilitate the shape transition of design elements so that designers can quickly evaluate the potential of a large number of design variations. Finally, an interface for design refinement was developed so that designs may be embodied by sketching over the 3D model. To test the proposed methodology, expert designers were recruited for a validation experiment with two conditions followed up by in-depth interviews. In the first condition, the participants were asked to sketch based on a design brief in their current working manner. In the second condition, they were asked to create designs using the proposed framework. It was tested whether there was a difference in the design outcomes. It was demonstrated that the proposed framework resulted in more satisfactory and higher-quality designs and generated design alternatives faster and in greater quantities. All participants agreed that the framework could be useful in the early design phase and responded that the proposed system provides more design inspiration than traditional design methods. Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the proposed framework could enhance the reevaluation potential of design concepts and assist in making better-informed design decisions.

KW  - Video summarization
KW  - Progressive reinforcement learning

AB  - Video summarization addresses generating video summaries to help watchers grasp the content of a video without watching it entirely. Many methods have engaged in automatic video summarization. Although these methods have performed well, they still suffer from limited training data and sparse reward problems. We propose a Progressive Reinforcement Learning Video Summarization structure (PRLVS) with an unsupervised reward. The reward measures the information and quality the selected frames convey without annotations. Striving to earn higher rewards, our PRLVS adopts a “T”-type human thinking paradigm: choosing some key frames and checking if their adjacent frames are better than them. To simulate this paradigm, we decompose the flat strategy into a hierarchical strategy consisting of a horizontal policy and a vertical policy. These two policies are optimized alternatively, which densifies the reward while reducing the exploration space. Their cooperation also makes the agent capture the context information of the whole video at every step. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark databases (i.e., SumMe, TVSum) show that our PRLVS outperforms the comparisons and approaches the supervised methods, which indicates that it is significant to integrate our unsupervised reward into the progressive reinforcement learning structure to address limited annotation and sparse reward problems.

This study presents a new evaluation approach to focus on evaluating the generalization capability at the model level. An empirical study was provided and the results reveal four important findings. First, the decision-making system generated at the model design stage outperforms the system generated at the model validation stage, which shows over-learning at the model level. Secondly, for the decision-making system generated either at the model design stage or at the model validation stage, the investment performance in the training period is much better than that in the testing period, exhibiting over-learning at the system level. Third, employing moving timeframe approach is unable to improve the investment performance at the model validation stage. Fourth, reducing the evolution generation and input variables are unable to avoid the over-learning at the model level. The major contribution of this study is to clarify the issue of over-learning at the model and the system level. For future research, this study developed a more reliable evaluation approach in examining the generalization capability of evolutionary computation based decision-making system.

We begin with a review of the evidence that we actually take in very little information with each glance and the implication that seeing is a process exquisitely tuned to our cognitive task of the moment. As a key part of this process, our brains execute visual queries using eye movements; visual features are detected in parallel to pick out just what is needed to resolve part of a cognitive problem and move on the next step. We begin to understand how seeing can be a distributed cognitive process executed partly in the brain and partly using a visualization as a tool. In particular, when the visualization is part of an interactive computer application, it provides the primary interface between cognitive operations in the human brain and computational operations. The theory of predictive cognition is introduced as a basis for how we should design presentations.

AB  - Summary
Scientific thinking about the minds of humans and other animals has been transformed by the idea that the brain is Bayesian. A cornerstone of this idea is that agents set the balance between prior knowledge and incoming evidence based on how reliable or ‘precise’ these different sources of information are — lending the most weight to that which is most reliable. This concept of precision has crept into several branches of cognitive science and is a lynchpin of emerging ideas in computational psychiatry — where unusual beliefs or experiences are explained as abnormalities in how the brain estimates precision. But what precisely is precision? In this Primer we explain how precision has found its way into classic and contemporary models of perception, learning, self-awareness, and social interaction. We also chart how ideas around precision are beginning to change in radical ways, meaning we must get more precise about how precision works.

AB  - Several gaps exist in the literature on coding. First, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.

The accounts of number are based on Lakoff and Núñez’s cognitively-based grounding metaphors for arithmetic. The approach incorporates elements of analogical inference into a generalised framework of conceptual blending, using some ideas from the work of Goguen. The ideas are worked out using Heuristic-Driven Theory Projection (HDTP, a method based on higher-order anti-unification). HDTP provides generalisations between domains, giving a crucial step in the process of finding commonalities between theories. In addition to generalisations, HDTP can also transfer concepts from one domain to another, allowing the construction of new conceptual blends. Alongside the methods by which conceptual blends may be constructed, we provide heuristics to guide this process.

AB  - Emotion recognition using Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fundamental prerequisite to improve Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Recognizing emotion from Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been globally accepted in many applications such as intelligent thinking, decision-making, social communication, feeling detection, affective computing, etc. Nevertheless, due to having too low amplitude variation related to time on EEG signal, the proper recognition of emotion from this signal has become too challenging. Usually, considerable effort is required to identify the proper feature or feature set for an effective feature-based emotion recognition system. To extenuate the manual human effort of feature extraction, we proposed a deep machine-learning-based model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). At first, the one-dimensional EEG data were converted to Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) featured images of channel correlation of EEG sub-bands. Then the images were fed into the CNN model to recognize emotion. Two protocols were conducted, namely, protocol-1 to identify two levels and protocol-2 to recognize three levels of valence and arousal that demonstrate emotion. We investigated that only the upper triangular portion of the PCC featured images reduced the computational complexity and size of memory without hampering the model accuracy. The maximum accuracy of 78.22% on valence and 74.92% on arousal were obtained using the internationally authorized DEAP dataset.

AB  - The continuous integration of young neurons into the adult brain represents a novel form of structural plasticity and has inspired the creation of numerous computational models to understand the functional role of adult neurogenesis. These computational models consist of abstract models that focus on the utility of new neurons in simple neural networks and biologically based models constrained by anatomical data that explore the role of new neurons in specific neural circuits such as the hippocampus. Simulation results from both classes of models have suggested a number of theoretical roles for neurogenesis such as increasing the capacity to learn novel information, promoting temporal context encoding, and influencing pattern separation. In this review, we discuss strategies and findings of past computational modeling efforts, current challenges and limitations, and new computational approaches pertinent to modeling adult neurogenesis.

AB  - The traditional view of spontaneous neural activity as ‘noise’ has been challenged by recent findings suggesting that: (a) spontaneous activity in cortical populations is highly structured in both space and time, (b) the spatio-temporal structure of spontaneous activity is linked to the underlying connectivity of the cortical network, (c) spontaneous cortical activity interacts with external stimulation to generate responses to the individual presentations of a stimulus, (d) network connectivity is shaped in part by the statistics of natural signals and (e) ongoing cortical activity represents a continuous top-down prediction/expectation signal that interacts with incoming input to generate an updated representation of the world. These results can be integrated to provide a new framework for the study of cortical computation.

AB  - Is vision a necessary building block for the foundations of mathematical cognition? A straightforward model to test the causal role visual experience plays in the development of numerical abilities is to study people born without sight. In this review we will demonstrate that congenitally blind people can develop numerical abilities that equal or even surpass those of sighted individuals, despite representing numbers using a qualitatively different representational format. We will also show that numerical thinking in blind people maps onto regions typically involved in visuo-spatial processing in the sighted, highlighting how intrinsic computational biases may constrain the reorganization of numerical networks in case of early visual deprivation. More generally, we will illustrate how the study of arithmetic abilities in congenitally blind people represents a compelling model to understand how sensory experience scaffolds the development of higher-level cognitive representations.

AB  - This chapter explores the smart city through the conceptual lens of scale, as a scale-making project and as a project that is subject to scaling processes. It explores how scalar notions figure in smart city discourses, and how the drive to scale shapes the prevailing approach to digital technology and urban space integration. It argues that deprioritizing the smart city's scalability logic can bring into view different ways of designing the integration of digital technologies and urban space that can better connect with the contextual and material specificities of local contexts and less attended to dimensions of urban livability. Rescaling the smart city to the local urban precinct scale and paying close attention to life-technology relations is further reasoned as a way to productively re-orient and extend thinking on the ethical significance of the smart city.

AB  - This essay addresses the nature of so–called ‘digital media’ in a literacy context from the perspectives of semiotics, theories of the ‘medium’, and computation. It argues that most accounts that attempt to work with some notion of ‘digital media’ anchor themselves insufficiently in semiotics and computation and the essential combination of these that is necessary when discussing digital media as an object of study. This weakens approaches, particularly when the concern is to develop ways of teaching engagement with contemporary communication practices at any level, i.e., improving ‘digital literacies’ of various kinds. Achieving more robust foundations is important for interventions which are not only more effective but also sustainable, minimizing the danger of obsolescence with each new technological turn of the screw. Foundations are also essential for a more balanced perspective on learning situations that does not dichotomize allegedly ‘digital’ and ‘non–digital’ practices and skills. Many such boundaries are deeply misleading and so unnecessarily compartmentalize thinking and restrict the application of relevant research results and methods. The focus of this essay is therefore to consider how a closer examination of media and their development, combined with the contributions made by information technologies, may help articulate notions of digital media that are more supportive of productive engagements with research and issues of literacy.

AB  - This chapter reviews the history of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that studies how computers can simulate the visual system of humans or other living things. It aims to enable computers to perceive and understand through the processing of visual information based on images or videos. From the 20th century onward, computer vision theory has been progressively developed. King-Sun Fu proposed syntactically structured representation and computation and constructed a top-down computational theory of vision. In the 1970s, David Marr then combined the knowledge of neuroscience, psychology, and other subjects of his time to systematically formulate a computational theory of vision, which made it possible to develop a more rigorous theory of the processing of visual information. Since then, computer vision has been flourishing.

AB  - Globally, the cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death. The early detection and quantification of these diseases can significantly reduce the mortality rate. Recent advances in cardiac MRI (CMRI) enable the detection of the left ventricle (LV) wall pathologies and the estimation of different quantification metrics that characterize the working of the heart. Examples of these metrics include the area of pathological tissue in the LV wall, the transmural extent of pathology, and other indexes such as wall thickening, functional strain, and the ejection fraction metrics. In the literature, several computational methods have been proposed in order to estimate these metrics based on using different CMRI acquisition techniques, such as cardiac-enhanced CMRI (CE-CMRI) and cine CMRI. This chapter overviews these computational methods and explains their basic ideas, focusing on the metrics extracted using CE-CMRI and cine CMRI.

AB  - We are at a point in time with rapid advances occurring in digital technologies, developing a range of new quantifiable markers termed “digital biomarkers,” which are increasingly utilized for diagnostics, as well as defining new operative mechanisms of health and disease. In parallel, significant advances have occurred in precision medicine, utilizing breakthroughs in “omics biology,” coupled with our understanding of their impact across systems in “systems biology.” Contemporaneously, a new approach to thinking of how health and disease evolve and impact an individual has emerged—that of considering mechanisms and impact across scales, i.e. on a “multi-scale” level, extending from the patient down to the molecule, and similarly from the patient up to society. In this chapter details of each of these approaches, their evolution and key current concepts are outlined. Moreover, the main theme and postulate developed in this chapter outlines the interconnectedness and the way in which each approach informs each other. In essence a cyclic, reinforcing, feedback loop exists, connecting digital technologies with precision and personalization approaches, across systems and scales, leading to enhanced diagnostics, the potential for new therapeutics and increasing insight into mechanisms. This cyclic flow of information will lead to new, more exacting technologies, with the ultimate outcome of enhanced efficacy, safety and improved health outcomes for patients and society.

AB  - Transmission systems of industrial robots are prone to get failures due to harsh operating environments. Fault diagnosis is of great significance for realizing safe operations for industrial robots. However, it is difficult to obtain faulty data in real applications. To migrate this issue, a generative adversarial one-shot diagnosis (GAOSD) approach is proposed to diagnose robot transmission faults with only one sample per faulty pattern. Signals representing kinematical characteristics were acquired by an attitude sensor. A bidirectional generative adversarial network (Bi-GAN) was then trained using healthy signals. Inspired by way of human thinking, the trained encoder in Bi-GAN was taken out to perform information abstraction for all signals. Finally, the abstracted signals were sent to a random forest for the one-shot diagnosis. The performance of the present technique was evaluated on an industrial robot experimental setup. Experimental results show that the proposed GAOSD has promising performance on the fault diagnosis of robot transmission systems.

AB  - Accurate modeling for forecasting of stock market volatility is a widely interesting research area both in academia as well as financial markets. This paper proposes an innovative Fuzzy Computationally Efficient EGARCH model to forecast the volatility of three stock market indexes. The proposed model represents a joint estimation of the membership function parameters of a TSK-type fuzzy inference system along with the leverage effect, asymmetric shock by leverage effect of EGARCH model in forecasting highly nonlinear and complicated financial time series model more accurately. Further unlike the conventional TSK type fuzzy neural network the proposed model uses a functional link neural network (FLANN) in the consequent part of the fuzzy rules to provide an improved mapping. Moreover, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is suggested to solve the parameters estimation problem of Fuzzy Computationally Efficient EGARCH model. Being a parallel direct search algorithm, DE has the strength of finding global optimal solutions regardless of the initial values of its few control parameters. Furthermore, the DE based algorithm aims to achieve an optimal solution with a rapid convergence rate. The proposed model has been compared with some GARCH family models and hybrid fuzzy systems and GARCH models based on three performance metrics: MSFE, RMSFE, and MAFE. The results indicate that the proposed method offers significant improvements in volatility forecasting performance in comparison with all other specified models.

AB  - In this paper the authors propose a novel semiotic approach to the design of interactive systems and computational systems, grounded in the most recent contributions within the debate around semiotic theory and analysis. This approach, that is here called Semiotics of Configurations (SoC), is proposed for its analytic power in describing material artifacts and settings with a purposely a-conceptualistic stance. The resulting analysis informs a kind of design that is aimed at reproducing and supporting the programs of action detected in the use of artifacts, as this use is “abducted” from the physical and material form of the artifacts themselves and from the observation of how content is transformed within and across them. This approach to design, called immanent design, has inspired a platform for the user-driven development and use of electronic documents and forms in cooperative and organizational domains. The framework is illustrated with a case drawn from a study performed in the domain of hospital work.

KW  - Meaning dimensionality
AB  - The paper presents the Affective Pertinentization model (APER), a theory of the affect and its role it plays in meaning-making. APER views the affect as the basic form of making sense of reality. It consists of a global, bipolar pattern of neurophysiological activity through which the organism maps the instant-by-instant variation of its environment. Such a pattern of neuropsychological activity is constituted by a plurality of bipolar affective dimensions, each of which maps a component of the environmental variability. The affect has a pluri-componential structure defining a multidimensional affective landscape that foregrounds (i.e., makes pertinent) a certain pattern of facets of the environment (e.g., its pleasantness/unpleasantness) relevant to survival, while backgrounding the others. Doing so, the affect grounds the following cognitive processes. Accordingly, meaning-making can be modeled as a function of the dimensionality of the affective landscape. The greater the dimensionality of the affective landscape, the more differentiated the system of meaning is. Following a brief review of current theories pertaining to the affect, the paper proceeds discussing the APER's core tenets – the multidimensional view of the affect, its semiotic function, and the concepts of Affective Landscape and Phase Space of Meaning. The paper then proceeds deepening the relationship between the APER model and other theories, highlighting how the APER succeeds in framing original conceptualizations of several challenging issues – the intertwinement between affect and sensory modalities, the manner in which the mind constitutes the content of the experience, the determinants of psychopathology, the intertwinement of mind and culture, and the spreading of affective forms of thinking and behaving in society. Finally, the unsolved issues and future developments of the model are briefly envisaged.

AB  - As computing power increases, more complex computational models are utilized for biomass supply system studies. The paper describes three commonly used modeling methods in this context, geographic information systems, life-cycle assessment, and discrete-time simulation and presents bibliometric analysis of work using these three study methods. Of the 498 publications identified in searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases, 17 reported on combinations of methods: 10 on life-cycle assessment and geographic information systems, six on joint use of life-cycle assessment and discrete-time simulation, and one on use of geographic information systems jointly with discrete-time simulation. While no articles dealt directly with simultaneous use of all three methods, several acknowledged the potential of this. The authors discuss numerous challenges identified in the review that arise in combining methods, among them computational load, the increasing number of assumptions, guaranteeing coherence between the models used, and the large quantities of data required. Discussion of issues such as the complexity of reporting and the need for standard procedures and terms becomes more critical as repositories bring together research materials, including entire models, from various sources. Efforts to mitigate many of modeling’s challenges have involved phase-specific modeling and use of such methods as expressions or uncertainty analysis in place of a complex secondary model. The authors conclude that combining modeling methods offer considerable potential for taking more variables into account; improving the results; and benefiting researchers, decision–makers, and operation managers by producing more reliable information.

AB  - Computational modelling has been used to address: (1) the variety of symptoms observed in schizophrenia using abstract models of behavior (e.g. Bayesian models – top-down descriptive models of psychopathology); (2) the causes of these symptoms using biologically realistic models involving abnormal neuromodulation and/or receptor imbalance (e.g. connectionist and neural networks – bottom-up realistic models of neural processes). These different levels of analysis have been used to answer different questions (i.e. understanding behavioral vs. neurobiological anomalies) about the nature of the disorder. As such, these computational studies have mostly supported diverging hypotheses of schizophrenia's pathophysiology, resulting in a literature that is not always expanding coherently. Some of these hypotheses are however ripe for revision using novel empirical evidence. Here we present a review that first synthesizes the literature of computational modelling for schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms into categories supporting the dopamine, glutamate, GABA, dysconnection and Bayesian inference hypotheses respectively. Secondly, we compare model predictions against the accumulated empirical evidence and finally we identify specific hypotheses that have been left relatively under-investigated.

AB  - There are different algebraic structures that one can use to model notions of computation. The most well- known are monads, but lately, applicative functors have been gaining popularity. These two structures can be understood as instances of the unifying notion of monoid in a monoidal category. When dealing with non-determinism, it is usual to extend monads and applicative functors with additional structure. However, depending on the desired non-determinism, there are different options of interaction between the existing and the additional structure. This article studies one of those options, which is captured algebraically by dioids. We generalise dioids to dioid categories and show how dioids in such a category model non- determinism in monads and applicative functors. Moreover, we study the construction of free dioids in a programming context.

AB  - A three-dimensional numerical study is conducted to better understand noise reduction results seen in the previous two-dimensional investigation of the acoustic effects of micro-tab device on airframe noise reduction. Without sacrificing the aerodynamic performance, it is possible to achieve high-lift noise reduction with the application of the micro-tab device attached to the pressure side of the flap surface near its trailing-edge. This study was carried out by numerical hybrid method, which combines Computational Fluid Dynamics and acoustic analogy to predict the farfield noise spectrum. The near-full-scale computational results show that the micro-tab device with reduced deflection of the high-lift devices achieves noise reduction in mid-to-high frequency domain, in particular the range that human beings are most sensitive to. In addition, a parametric study in terms of geometric variation of the micro-tab was also investigated and reported. The three-dimensional results obtained thus far show reduction in noise levels with use of micro-tab.

AB  - Computational models of cells, tissues and organisms are necessary for increased understanding of biological systems. In particular, modeling approaches will be crucial for moving biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. Pharmaceutical companies identify molecular interventions that they predict will lead to therapies at the organism level, suggesting that computational biology can play a key role in the pharmaceutical industry. We discuss pharmaceutically-relevant computational modeling approaches currently used as predictive tools. Specific examples demonstrate how companies can employ these computational models to improve the efficiency of transforming targets into therapies.

AB  - Purpose
This study aims to describe the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of a kindergarten educator who implements a lesson plan about informal inferential reasoning designed in a lesson study group.
Design/methodology/approach
To this end, we analyzed teaching interventions in two kindergarten lessons focused on the playful task of tossing two coins, associated with inferential statistical reasoning. The study highlights the importance of arguing and promoting this reasoning to develop statistical thinking. It is crucial to recognize how early students can be subject to learning experiences that promote a language of uncertainty, assess the evidence provided by the data, and make generalizations.
Findings
The results reveal that while the educator demonstrated knowledge and skills relevant to the curriculum and conceptual teaching strategies, the understanding of the content by the students and the integration of the PCK components still present a challenge.
Practical implications
The lesson study collaborative teaching practices that promote PCK have proven effective for informing the design and implementation of instructional practices supporting the development of early statistical thinking in young children.
Originality/value
The study enriches the knowledge regarding the potential of the lesson study (LS) in the professional learning of kindergarten educators. It also contributes to a comprehensive approach based on authentic playful experiences in grade K that supports the development of early statistical thinking in young children.

However, it is important to look at this evolution against its history. AI’s historical evolution has been beset with underperformance and ethical concerns in data training and responsible deployment. Information science has undergone significant changes with AI׳s integration, impacting information retrieval, classification, and library automation. More specifically Machine Learning plays a crucial role in understanding human requirements for information and processing large data set, but challenges like bias persist. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT represent the vanguard of public adoption of AI driven information systems and have exhibited remarkable performance in natural language processing. While they enhance information searching and content creation, users must understand limitations, biases, and practice critical thinking for responsible utilisation in a digital age.

AB  - European Union has introduced the European Trading System (ETS) as a tool for developing and implementing international treaties related to climate changes and to identify the most cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most substantial. Companies producing carbon emissions must effectively manage associated costs by buying or selling carbon emission futures. Viewed from this perspective, this paper provides a model for managing the risk by buying and selling carbon emission futures by implementing techniques that leverage computational intelligence. Three computational intelligence techniques are proposed to provide accurate and timely forecasts for changes in the price of carbon: a novel hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller that forms a closed-loop feedback mechanism called PATSOS; an artificial neural network (ANN) based system; an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results are based on 1074 daily carbon price observations collected to comprise a useful time-series dataset and for evaluation of the proposed techniques. The extra-sample performance of the proposed techniques is calculated. Analysis results are compared with those produced by other models. Comparison studies reveal that PATSOS is the most accurate and promising methodology for predicting the price of carbon. It is stated that this paper registers a first attempt to apply a hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller to forecasting carbon prices.

AB  - The impact of metacognition on pupils' moral ideals and emotional development was investigated as well as it highlights on a collaborative research between metacognition and artificial intelligence that can bridge the gap (emotional, ethical, moral reasoning, common sense) existing in AI. A total of 200 pupils were selected in the study's sample. Participants (100 high metacognitive students and 100 low metacognitive students) were chosen at random and ranged in age from 17 to 21 years old. The influence of metacognition on students' moral ideals and emotional development was studied using a t-test. The outcome reveals that the mean score of moral reasoning on high metacognitive students as 66.77 and for low metacognitive students as 63.08, t value = 3.21, at the 0.01 level, statistically highly significant. The mean emotional maturity score for high metacognitive students was 29.99, while for low metacognitive students was 33.01, t value as 2.81, shows statistically significant at the 0.05 level. This demonstrates that the higher the score, the less emotionally stable the pupils are. The current findings show that metacognitive thinking has a major impact on moral reasoning and emotional maturity, and that as metacognition levels rise, so do moral reasoning and emotional maturity. Metacognition can strengthen the humanistic qualities which are majorly lacking in AI. In addition, there are new avenues being opened in the study of artificial intelligence via metacognitive study which is significant and futuristic.

AB  - Summary
Vision is widely used as a model system to gain insights into how sensory inputs are processed and interpreted by the brain. Historically, careful quantification and control of visual stimuli have served as the backbone of visual neuroscience. There has been less emphasis, however, on how an observer’s task influences the processing of sensory inputs. Motivated by diverse observations of task-dependent activity in the visual system, we propose a framework for thinking about tasks, their role in sensory processing, and how we might formally incorporate tasks into our models of vision.

AB  - Beginning with a reconstruction of the anthropological paradigms underlying The Vienna Manifesto and The Onlife Manifesto (§ 1.1), this paper distinguishes between two possible approaches to digital humanism: an extroverted one, principally engaged in finding a way to humanize digital technologies, and an introverted one, pointing instead attention to how digital technologies can re-humanize us, particularly our “mindframe” (§ 1.2). On this basis, I stress that if we take seriously the consequences of the “mediatic turn”, according to which human reason is finally recognized as mediatically contingent (§ 2.1), then we should accept that just as the book created the poietic context for the development of traditional humanism and its “bookish” idea of private and public reason, so too digital psycho-technologies today provide the conditions for the rise of a new humanism (§ 2.2). I then discuss the possible humanizing potential of digital simulated worlds: I compare the symbolic-reconstructive mindset to the sensorimotor mindset (§ 3.1), and I highlight their respective mediological association with the book and the video game, advocating for the peculiar thinking and reasoning affordances now offered by the new digital psycho-technologies (§ 3.2).

AB  - We develop a theory based on the evidence reported in Hare et al. (2009) to explain consumption of goods that feature a low-order attribute (e.g., taste) and a high-order attribute (e.g., health). One brain system with access to the low-order attribute computes the goal value of consumption while another brain system can modulate this value, at a cost, by transmitting information regarding the high-order attribute. We determine the optimal modulation and consumption strategy as a function of the cost of information transmission and the environment. We show that in healthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly unhealthy goods so as to trigger abstinence when consumption would ordinarily occur. Conversely, in unhealthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly healthy choices so as to trigger consumption when abstinence would ordinarily occur. From an outside perspective, individuals may appear to under-regulate their choices (self-indulgence) but also to over-regulate them (self-restraint). Both modulation and decisions are affected by factors orthogonal to the decision problem. In particular, taxing executive functions results in less modulation and more inefficient behavior. Finally, the model can shed light on issues related to eating disorders, present-biased preferences, habit formation and compulsive behavior.

AB  - The production of food that is environmentally friendly and presents a high economic return is one of the current concerns for the food industry. Eco-efficiency links the environmental performance of a product to its economic value. In this context, this study combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to propose a two-step eco-efficiency methodology assessment for the fish canning industry. An eco-label rating system based on a descriptive weighting of environmental (Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential and the ReCiPe Single Score Endpoint) and economic (Value Added) indicators was applied to the canned anchovy. Secondly, LCA-LCC results were coupled to linear programming (LP) tools in order to define a composite eco-efficiency index. This approach enables translation into economic terms of the environmental damage caused when a given alternative is chosen. In particular, different origins for anchovy species (South American vs. Cantabrian) and related waste management alternatives (landfill, incineration and valorization) were evaluated under this cradle to gate approach. Results indicated that substantial differences can be observed depending on the origin of the fish. Anchovies landed in Cantabria show a higher value added score at the expense of larger environmental impacts, mainly due to fuel use intensity. Moreover, its environmental scores are lowered when fish residues are valorized into marketable products, while increasing the value added. This study demonstrates the environmental and economic benefits of applying circular economy. According to this, it is possible to introduce the cradle-to-cradle concept in the fish canned industry. The methodology proposed is intended to be useful to decision-makers in the anchovy canning sector and can be applied to other regions and industrial sectors.

AB  - Fundamental observations and principles derived from traditional physiological studies of multisensory integration have been difficult to reconcile with computational and psychophysical studies that share the foundation of probabilistic (Bayesian) inference. We review recent work on multisensory integration, focusing on experiments that bridge single-cell electrophysiology, psychophysics, and computational principles. These studies show that multisensory (visual–vestibular) neurons can account for near-optimal cue integration during the perception of self-motion. Unlike the nonlinear (superadditive) interactions emphasized in some previous studies, visual–vestibular neurons accomplish near-optimal cue integration through subadditive linear summation of their inputs, consistent with recent computational theories. Important issues remain to be resolved, including the observation that variations in cue reliability appear to change the weights that neurons apply to their different sensory inputs.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Online food delivery has transformed the last-mile of food and grocery delivery, with unnoticed yet often significant impacts upon the transport and logistics network. This new model of food delivery is not just increasing congestion in urban centers though, it is also changing the contours and qualities of those doing delivery—namely through gig economy work. This new system of food consumption and provision is rapidly gaining traction, but assessments around its current and future sustainability tend to hold separate the notions of social, environmental and economic sustainability—with few to date working to understand how these can interact, influence and be in conflict with one another. This paper seeks to work with this broader understanding of sustainability, whilst also foregrounding the perspectives of gig economy couriers who are often marginalized in such assessments of the online food delivery system. We make use of systems thinking and Campbell’s conflict model of sustainability to do this. In assessing the online food delivery in this way, we seek to not only provide a counternarrative to some of these previous assessments, but to also challenge those proposing the use of gig economy couriers as an environmentally sustainable logistics intervention in other areas of last-mile logistics to consider how this might impact the broader sustainability of their system, now and in the future.
