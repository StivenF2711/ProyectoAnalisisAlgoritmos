AB  - Attributing mental states to other people fundamentally shapes how we bond, coordinate, and predict the actions of others. Perceiving a person's facial expressions and body language in the present contribute to our ability to understand what they are thinking and feeling. Yet, people do not exist in a vacuum and individuals often think about people who are not directly in front of them. People inhabit remembered and imagined episodes, where the surrounding location and objects can guide attributions of their mental states. In this article, I propose the episodic mindreading hypothesis, arguing that the episodic representation of past and future events in which a target person is embedded will affect whether and how the target's mind is read. The content and phenomenological quality of imagined and remembered episodes can alter what mental states are attributed to a target and the accessibility of those mental states. This hypothesis encourages researchers to think about mentalizing as neither dependent on nor completely exclusive from the episodic memory system. Instead, the episodic memory system can modulate and inform mindreading, and likely vice versa. The article reviews extant knowledge and highlights open questions for future research to explore with implications for healthy and impaired social cognition.

AB  - The unknown multiscale structure hidden in large complex systems is explored bottom-up through discovered heterogeneity under structural dependency embedded within structured data sets. Via two real complex systems, we demonstrate computed hierarchical structures with broken symmetry constituting data’s information content. Through graphic displays, such information content indirectly, but efficiently resolves system-related scientific issues that are difficult to resolve directly. All bottom-up explorations and computations are based on conditional entropy and mutual information evaluated upon contingency table platforms after categorizing all quantitative features. Categorical Exploratory Data Analysis (CEDA) first extracts global major factors that share significant mutual information with the targeted response (Re) variable against many covariate (Co) features under the presence of structural dependency. Then each global major factor is taken as one perspective of heterogeneity to subdivide the entire data set according to its categories into sub-collections. This simple “de-associating” protocol significantly reduces structural dependency among the rest of the features such that another run of major factor selection performed on the sub-collection scale can precisely identify which feature sets could provide extra information beyond the global major factor. Finally, informative patterns collected from multiple perspectives of heterogeneity are displayed to explicitly resolve issues of prediction, classification, and detecting minute dynamic changes.

AB  - This paper presents a generic method, referred to as Iterative Discovery, to guide deliberation with analysis where the aim is to plan refinements to management interventions with difficult-to-define objectives, often due to system uncertainties and diverse stakeholder positions. The method can be initiated by evaluating a scenario describing the current-best intervention. This provides the starting point for three evaluation cycles, focusing on model assumptions, alternative interventions and management targets. The outcome of this method is a list of management targets that can and cannot be achieved, the potential interventions that correspond to these targets, and the assumptions and uncertainties associated with these interventions. It was applied to a case study for environmental flow management in the Macquarie Marshes, Australia. We identified feasible management targets based on ecological outcomes in flood suitability across different locations, climate conditions and species, and the suitable environmental flow volumes that correspond to these targets.

AB  - We are constantly exposed to socially conflicting situations in everyday life, and cognitive flexibility is essential for adaptively coping with such difficulties. Flexible goal choice and pursuit are not exclusively conscious, and therefore cognitive flexibility involves both explicit and implicit forms of processing. However, it is unclear how individual differences in explicit and implicit aspects of flexibility are associated with neural activity in a resting state. Here, we measured intrinsic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) as an indicator of regional brain spontaneous activity, together with explicit and implicit aspects of cognitive flexibility using the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS) and Implicit Association Test (IAT). Consistent with the dual processing theory, there was a strong association between explicit aspects of flexibility (CFS score) and “rationalism” thinking style and between implicit aspects (IAT effect) and “experientialism.” The level of explicit flexibility was also correlated with fALFF values in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, whereas the level of implicit flexibility was correlated with fALFF values in the right cerebellum. Furthermore, the fALFF values in both regions predicted individual preference for flexible decision-making strategy in a vignettes simulation task. These results add to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making for solving social conflicts. More generally, our findings highlight the utility of RS-fMRI combined with both explicit and implicit psychometric measures for better understanding individual differences in social cognition.

AB  - A sequential approach to combining two established modeling techniques (systems thinking and Bayesian Belief Networks; BBNs) was developed and applied to climate change adaptation research within the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQ-CARI). Six participatory workshops involving 66 stakeholders based within SEQ produced six system conceptualizations and 22 alpha-level BBNs. The outcomes of the initial systems modeling exercise successfully allowed the selection of critical determinants of key response variables for in depth analysis within more homogeneous, sector-based groups of participants. Using two cases, this article focuses on the processes and methodological issues relating to the use of the BBN modeling technique when the data are based on expert opinion. The study expected to find both generic and specific determinants of adaptive capacity based on the perceptions of the stakeholders involved. While generic determinants were found (e.g. funding and awareness levels), sensitivity analysis identified the importance of pragmatic, context-based determinants, which also had methodological implications. The article raises questions about the most appropriate scale at which the methodology applied can be used to identify useful generic determinants of adaptive capacity when, at the scale used, the most useful determinants were sector-specific. Comparisons between individual BBN conditional probabilities identified diverging and converging beliefs, and that the sensitivity of response variables to direct descendant nodes was not always perceived consistently. It was often the accompanying narrative that provided important contextual information that explained observed differences, highlighting the benefits of using critical narrative with modeling tools.

As we approach computational oncology and Deep Learning Healthcare, our mathematical models of cancer dynamics must be revised. Recent findings support the perspective that cancer-microenvironment interactions may consist of chaotic gene expressions and turbulent protein flows during pattern formation. As such, cancer pattern formation, protein-folding and metastatic invasion are discussed herein as processes driven by chemical turbulence within the framework of complex systems theory. To conclude, cancer stem cells are presented as strange attractors of the Waddington landscape.

AB  - The State Estimation (SE) computational procedure plays a crucial role in modern electric power system security control by monitoring and analyzing operational conditions and predicting any emergency. In order to estimate state variables, Power System State Estimation (PSSE) takes into account the magnitudes and phases of voltage on each bus. To address the state estimation challenges in power systems, in this paper, we propose a novel application of the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) specifically tailored for the state estimation problem. We have assessed the introduced algorithm using the frameworks of both the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30-bus test systems. The first formulation is the Weighted Least Square (WLS) method, and the second is the Weighted Least Absolute Value (WLAV) method, both of which are objective function formulations. By comparing the results, it is clear that CSA-based SE is superior to the other metaheuristic algorithms considered, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Bee Swarm Optimization (ABSO). As a point of comparison, we use the Newton–Raphson method for calculating load flow. It has been shown that the proposed CSA-based SE technique has better accuracy than the other two algorithms in all different test systems. With this study, the power system is operated more accurately and reliably by the operators operating the system.

AB  - The paper considers the long-term trajectory of public health and whether a ‘Golden Era’ in Public Health might be coming to an end. While successful elements of the 20th century policy approach need still to be applied in the developing world, two significant flaws are now apparent within its core thinking. It assumes that continuing economic growth will generate sufficient wealth to pay for the public health infrastructure and improvement needed in the 21st century when, in reality, externalised costs are spiralling. Secondly, there is evidence of growing mismatch between ecosystems and human progress. While 20th century development has undeniably improved public health, it has also undermined the capacity to maintain life on a sustainable basis and has generated other more negative health consequences. For these and other reasons a rethink about the role, purpose and direction of public health is needed. While health has to be at the heart of any viable notion of progress the dominant policy path offers new versions of the ‘health follows wealth’ position. The paper posits ecological public health as a radical project to reshape the conditions of existence. Both of these broad paths require different functions and purposes from their institutions, professions and politicians. The paper suggests that eco-systems pressures, including climate change, are already adding to pressure for a change of course.

Such a logic consists of an intersection type assignment system, which we derive from the denotational semantics of the calculus, based on the monadic approach to model computational λ-calculi. The system is obtained by constructing a filter model in the category of ω-algebraic lattices, such that the typing rules can be recovered out of the term interpretation. By construction, the so-obtained type system satisfies the “type-semantics” property and completeness.

AB  - Phenomenology was born with the mission to give foundations for science of experience and to open consciousness to scientific study. The influence of phenomenology initiated in the works of Husserl and continued in a wide range of works of others was immense, but mainly within the confines of philosophy and the humanities. The actual attempts to develop a scientific discipline of the study of consciousness and to carry out research on cognition and consciousness were always based on the methods of traditional science in which elimination of the subjective has been always a primary tenet. Thus, focus was mainly on neurological correlates of conscious phenomena. The present paper is an attempt to initiate an extension and revision of phenomenological methodology with the use of philosophical and scientific experience and knowledge accumulated in a century of inquiry and research in relevant disciplines. The question which disciplines are relevant is crucial and our answer is innovative. The range of disciplines involved here is from information science and studies of computation, up to cultural psychology and the studies of philosophical traditions of the East. Concepts related to information and computation studies provide a general conceptual framework free from the limitations of particular languages and of linguistic analysis. This conceptual framework is extending the original perspective of phenomenology to issues of modern technology and science. Cultural psychology gives us tools to root out what in phenomenology was considered universal for humanity, but was a result of European ethnocentrism. Most important here is the contrast between individualistic and collectivistic cultural determinants of consciousness. Finally, philosophical tradition of the East gives alternatives in seeking solutions for fundamental problems. This general outline of the research methodology is illustrated by an example of its use when phenomenology is studied within the conceptual framework of information.

AB  - This chapter presents a series of representative techniques for system modeling and mapping, including resource availability analysis, material flow analysis, system dynamics, and sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. These are among the well-established computational modeling methods adopted widely in engineering, environmental, and social science disciplines. They are particularly useful in the context of resource and waste management, providing clearer visualization of the system and enabling reliable prediction of system behavior. Resource availability assessment provides a bird's eye view of the interdependencies among resources and the overall feasibility for a system to operate with the available resources. Material flow analysis facilitates a robust mapping of resource consumption, production, and losses, offering insights for identifying opportunities to improve resource efficiency and minimize waste. System dynamics enables us to understand the complex behavior of a system through exploring the interaction of different factors, serving as a forecasting tool for future scenarios. Sensitivity analysis determines the system's responsiveness to different input values, identifying the most influential inputs in the system's response. Uncertainty analysis quantifies variations and uncertainties in potential system responses due to variations in inputs.

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the Correlated Panels Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) Approach. The findings indicated that poor governance performance in the CEMAC zone deteriorates the effects of Chinese foreign direct investments and human capital development on the macroeconomic performance of the CEMAC zone. At the same time, poor governance performance also deteriorates the impact of foreign aid and personal remittances received on the macroeconomic performance of the CEMAC zone. This study strongly recommends measures to improve institutional quality such as increased training on ethical thinking in all forms of education, meritocratic recruitment to the civil service, and auditing of public finances and services.

AB  - Consumers make price offers to sellers in a variety of domains, such as when buying cars or houses or when bidding in auctions for airline upgrades, art, or collectibles. Submitting an offer typically entails administrative, waiting, and opportunity costs. Making such costly price offers involves two intertwined decisions—in addition to determining how much to offer, consumers must also decide whether to make an offer in the first place. We examine the impact of offer-submission costs on consumer behavior using a series of incentive-compatible experiments. Our findings reveal a preference inconsistency, whereby the preferences implied by one of the decisions do not align with the preferences implied by the other. In particular, potential buyers enter more often than their offer amounts would predict based on standard economic models. This preference inconsistency is robust to two interventions designed to help consumers make offer-amount and entry decisions—(1)the provision of interactive-feedback decision aids and (2)the sequencing of the two sub-decisions in the normative order. Neither of these interventions resolves the inconsistency. Instead, the patterns of results suggest that consumers approach the offer-amount and entry decisions as if they were unrelated. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of offer-submission interfaces, as well as for econometric attempts to infer consumer preferences from offer and bidding data.

Moreover, we also introduce the use of input frames composed of 468 facial landmarks coordinates and an innovative sampling procedure avoiding padding. The proposed randomized classifier is trained for emotion recognition on video sequences and the related accuracy is compared with a non-randomized version of the same model and with well-known benchmark architectures, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of classification accuracy and training time.

AB  - Molten salt-doped MgO adsorbent is considered one of the most promising CO2 adsorbents in the field. In this work, MgO-based adsorbents were prepared by one-step calcination using MgCl2·6 H2O as magnesium source. The CO2 adsorption performance of MgO-based adsorbents was investigated via different methods. Results showed that the maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of MgO doped by LiNO3-NaNO3-KNO3 was 57.1% at the CO2 concentration of 80% and 350 ℃, and the MgO-based adsorbents showed good regeneration. The nanosheet structure of the MgO-based adsorbents decreased with the increase in the number of cycles, whereas the crystal structures of MgO and alkali metal nitrates did not change because of multiple decarbonization. DFT computation revealed selective adsorption of CO2 on different crystal faces of MgO. The (200) crystal face of molten salt-doped MgO did not have CO2 trap ability. In addition, the doped nitrate did not directly participate in the reaction but reduced the adsorption energy of MgO carbonation. The adsorption energies of the MgO (220) and (222) crystal faces after doping with nitrate were reduced to − 2.07 and − 3.26 eV, respectively. The overall energy level of adsorption decreased as the number of resonance peaks and the stability of the structure increased. This study explains why MgO currently fails to reach the theoretical adsorption capacity and reveals the underlying mechanism of molten salts.

AB  - Emily M. Standen discusses how she has been impacted by C.C. Lindsey's chapter on “Form, Function and Locomotory Habits in Fish,” in Fish Physiology, Volume 7 published in 1978. Fish locomotion has been a widely studied field. Physicists, mathematicians, engineers and biologists have added to our understanding of how fish move through water, through different substrates and over land. Since the 1978 publication of C.C. Lindsey's chapter on Form, function and locomotory habits in fish, there have been remarkable advancements in the technology and tools we use to measure, quantify, calculate and model fish motion. This article argues that although new technologies are adding much higher resolution data on different aspects of fish swimming, they support the hypotheses and understanding that was already laid out by early experimentalists using simple and elegant techniques. As a celebration of the enduring impact C.C. Lindsey's 1978 chapter has had on the field of fish swimming, this article reflects upon how the history of fish swimming, and Lindsey's remarkable breadth and clarity in reviewing it, clearly shows the importance of how we approach our science, how we reflect back on the body of literature that make up whatever field we work in, and what we can do to ensure we move knowledge forward in the most beneficial way possible. Despite huge leaps forward in the technologies used to study and compute fish locomotor habits, Lindsey's chapter remains a thorough and impressive summary of the work of so many early scientists, that still guide and influence the questions that surround fish locomotion today.

Interviews with teachers in each country revealed that Chinese and US teachers have distinct ways of thinking about how mathematics should be taught and how students learn. Many Chinese teachers talked about developing students’ interest in mathematics and relating the content of mathematics lessons to real-life situations. The US teachers talked about students' learning styles and using hands-on approaches to learning mathematics. Furthermore, these beliefs may be widespread and persistent within each country because the set of ideas among teachers appear to be internally consistent. Implications for teacher change and the study of teachers' beliefs are discussed.

AB  - Understanding how to control how the brain's functioning mediates mental experience and the brain's processing to alter cognition or disease are central projects of cognitive and neural science. The advent of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) now makes it possible to observe the biology of one's own brain while thinking, feeling and acting. Recent evidence suggests that people can learn to control brain activation in localized regions, with corresponding changes in their mental operations, by observing information from their brain while inside an MRI scanner. For example, subjects can learn to deliberately control activation in brain regions involved in pain processing with corresponding changes in experienced pain. This may provide a novel, non-invasive means of observing and controlling brain function, potentially altering cognitive processes or disease.

AB  - Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) offer power generation capabilities for diverse applications including commercial enterprises, industrial sectors, and residential technologies. Nevertheless, the comprehensive integration of PEMFC applications could be improved by challenges related to degradation and durability. The imperative development of efficient performance prognostic models assumes a pivotal role in the prognosis of remaining useful life (RUL), health monitoring, and effective utilization of PEMFCs. This paper centers on the prognostication of critical components within PEMFCs and introduces a transfer learning approach based on variational autoencoder and bi-directional long short-term memory with an attention mechanism (Bi-LSTM-AM) model. This approach combines feature fusion, knee-point detection, and a sophisticated deep-learning-based predictive model. Notably, incorporating the variational autoencoder as the framework for feature fusion introduces a novel perspective previously unexplored. Identifying the knee point and knowing the start point on the training data, facilitates optimized parameter computation. The application of transfer learning facilitates the transfer of optimal model parameters and weights from a source to a target dataset. Conclusively, the estimation of stack voltage degradation and real-time RUL prediction based on the test dataset is executed by implementing our proposed method. The stack voltage prediction findings showcase the Bi-LSTM-AM model’s superior performance relative to comparison models. The proposed online rolling prediction model, utilizing a sliding window technique for RUL prediction, yields significantly enhanced accuracy, culminating in a relative error margin ranging from approximately 1.69% to 5.04%.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology for grounding agent-based social simulation in ethnographic data, using the example of crime research. The application of computational tools in crime research typically entails a removal of the “intelligible frame” of criminal behaviour and, hence, of meaningful evidence. Ethnography is a microscopic research tradition geared towards the preservation of contextualized meaning deemed essential for the exploration of the variety of prospective alternative scenarios and, hence, of plausible futures. On the basis of exemplary empirical material from a qualitative study on the transit trade of cocaine in the Netherlands, this paper looks into the complementarity and potential integration of the research traditions of ethnography and agent-based modelling. That is to say, it explores the compatibility of the formal languages of both these domains and the mutual benefit of “stitching together” these at first sight very different methods. The ethnographic approach to social simulation specifies the what-if relations of traditional/conventional ABM modelling into condition-action sequences. As we contend, it is exactly this more microscopic level of condition-action sequences that is needed to facilitate ”thick description” and, in turn, enable the grounding of ABM in meaningful evidence.

AB  - With the aim to offer an alternative understanding of smart cities, this chapter explores the relationship between smart and informal characteristics, presenting a discussion of two concepts arguably found in both smart and informal types of urban development: self-organization and the everyday. For this purpose, this chapter discusses the social and spatial production of informal settlements—how these areas show high degrees of self-organization based on everyday actions and interactions. In line with Rauws (2016), observers can see smart cities as networks of knowledge, actions, and selection of choices; yet this view also aligns with the actions informal settlers in Latin America take to produce their own living environments via self-organization and everyday practices. The chapter suggests how smart technologies can utilize computational logics to help measure and interpret these self-organized systems, as well as help decipher everyday creativity, based on uncertainty, autonomy, and freedom. An urban area may possess no formal planning processes, yet residents’ bottom-up social and spatial initiatives give shape to their settlements and to the city. In this sense the use of smart technologies can bring heightened understandings to informality; therefore not only the smart but also the informal can undergo reconceptualizing. We suggest viewing the smart and the informal as collective and adaptive self-organized systems fuelled by everyday practices where the social emerges as everyday creativity.

AB  - The paper deals with assessment of the influence of adaptive e-learning as a part of learning analytics on learning effectiveness of primary school pupils. E-learning exercises containing implemented adaptive elements were created in accordance with the Bloom's Taxonomy. Within the pilot study the authors detected high percentage success rate during e-learning exercise completion. This leads to formulation of the question „Can any e-learning exercise of lower cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy be skipped without affecting the cognitive thinking for solution of the e-learning exercises on upper cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy?” To answer the question, the algorithm of adaptive e-learning was defined and hypotheses were established. The research was carried out as pedagogical experiment comparing the results of both experimental and control groups of pupils. The research hypotheses were confirmed by statistical analysis of the research data. The results confirm that adaptive features of e-learning can be implemented in the primary education. The research results confirm the fact that educational objectives can be achieved with some pupils more effectively. Consequently, the implementation of adaptive elements into e-learning at the primary school supports an individual approach when completing e-learning exercises according to the principle of cognitive computing.

AB  - Many have argued that the very notion of human nature is untenable given the facts of evolution and should accordingly be discarded. This paper, by contrast, argues that the notion can be retained in a coherent and modern way. The present account expounds on the view of human nature as a collection of species-typical psychological adaptations, and outlines how it can be understood in formally modeled computational terms. The view defended is also heavily developmental and connects directly with contemporary evolutionary developmental biology. Furthermore, the notion of human nature developed here allows us to abstract away from the obfuscating variability that manifests not only between individuals across ontogeny, but also cross-culturally and throughout time.

AB  - Biweekly county COVID-19 data were linked with Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data to analyze population risk exposures enabled by pre-pandemic, country-wide commuter networks. Results from fixed-effects, spatial, and computational statistical approaches showed that commuting network exposure to COVID-19 predicted an area's COVID-19 cases and deaths, indicating spillovers. Commuting spillovers between counties were independent from geographic contiguity, pandemic-time mobility, or social media ties. Results suggest that commuting connections form enduring social linkages with effects on health that can withstand mobility disruptions. Findings contribute to a growing relational view of health and place, with implications for neighborhood effects research and place-based policies.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a theoretical interpretation of how satellite navigation transforms drivers’ experience of automotive spaces. The use of satellite navigation has, so far, been predominantly studied from a cognitivist perspective based on the computer model of cognition and the theory of spatial disengagement. Experimental studies have concluded that over-reliance on digital navigation tools diminishes spatial orientation and spatial memory. According to the dominant interpretation, satellite navigation causes disengagement from space. After addressing these approaches, the paper introduces an embodied perspective of satellite navigation. This is accomplished by applying the phenomenology of perception of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose notions, such as perception, body schema, motor habit, and virtual body, illuminate otherwise undertheorized dimensions of drivers’ spaces. By using digital tools for wayfinding, drivers’ body schema, virtual body, and perception of space are modified, thereby enabling an engagement with convoluted ‘mesh spaces.’ This new term is integral to the interpretation of drivers’ spaces, as well as being distinct from that of ‘hybrid space,’ although both aim to conceptualize spaces, including physical objects and their visual representations. Conclusions will be drawn against the broader context of the mediatization of everyday life.

A simple video game was developed with this in mind and an effort was made to avoid design pitfalls commonly found in edutainment titles. The study involved 112 schoolchildren ages 7 to 9. Test group and control group were given a pre-test, a re-test and a post-test. The re-test and the post-test respectively showed 16% and 7% score difference in favor of the test group. Focusing on questions featuring content analogous to basic programming concepts showed 36% and 20% difference in scores.

AB  - Individuals with visual inefficiencies or different abilities face difficulties using their hands to operate smartphones and computers, necessitating reliance on others to enter data. Such dependence may lead to security and privacy issues, especially when sensitive information is shared with helpers. To address this problem, we present Think2Type, an efficient Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that enables users to translate their active intentions into text format based on Morse code. BCI leverages brain activity to facilitate interaction with computers, often captured via Electroencephalography (EEG). This work proposes an enhanced attention-based deep learning strategy to develop an efficient text conversion mechanism from EEG signals. We begin by collecting EEG signals from standard benchmark datasets and extracting spectral and statistical features in phase 1, concatenating them into concatenated feature set 1 (F1). In phase 2, we extract spatial and temporal features via a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), respectively, concatenating them into concatenated feature set 2 (F2). Weighted feature fusion is performed on concatenated features F1 and F2, with the hybrid optimization algorithm Eurasian Oystercatcher Wild Geese Migration Optimization (EOWGMO) optimizing the weight for improved fusion efficiency. The text conversion phase utilizes the Multiscale Dilated Adaptive DenseNet with Attention Mechanism (MDADenseNet-AM) to obtain the converted text information. The MDADenseNet-A's parameters are optimized to improve thought-to-text conversion performance. The developed model's performance is evaluated via experimental analysis and compared to conventional techniques, resulting in a higher accuracy value of 96.41%, facilitating appropriate text conversion.

AB  - Hinge motions are essential for many protein functions, and their dynamics are important to understand underlying biological mechanisms. The ways that these motions are represented by various computational methods differ significantly. By focusing on a specific class of motion, we have developed a new hinge-domain anisotropic network model (hdANM) that is based on the prior identification of flexible hinges and rigid domains in the protein structure and the subsequent generation of global hinge motions. This yields a set of motions in which the relative translations and rotations of the rigid domains are modulated and controlled by the deformation of the flexible hinges, leading to a more restricted, specific view of these motions. hdANM is the first model, to our knowledge, that combines information about protein hinges and domains to model the characteristic hinge motions of a protein. The motions predicted with this new elastic network model provide important conceptual advantages for understanding the underlying biological mechanisms. As a matter of fact, the generated hinge movements are found to resemble the expected mechanisms required for the biological functions of diverse proteins. Another advantage of this model is that the domain-level coarse graining makes it significantly more computationally efficient, enabling the generation of hinge motions within even the largest molecular assemblies, such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. hdANM is also comprehensive as it can perform in the same way as the well-known protein dynamics models (anisotropic network model, rotations-translations of blocks, and nonlinear rigid block normal mode analysis), depending on the definition of flexible and rigid parts in the protein structure and on whether the motions are extrapolated in a linear or nonlinear fashion. Furthermore, our results indicate that hdANM produces more realistic motions as compared to the anisotropic network model. hdANM is an open-source software, freely available, and hosted on a user-friendly website.

AB  - Homology modeling is a method for building protein 3D structures using protein primary sequence and utilizing prior knowledge gained from structural similarities with other proteins. The homology modeling process is done in sequential steps where sequence/structure alignment is optimized, then a backbone is built and later, side-chains are added. Once the low-homology loops are modeled, the whole 3D structure is optimized and validated. In the past three decades, a few collective and collaborative initiatives allowed for continuous progress in both homology and ab initio modeling. Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) is a worldwide community experiment that has historically recorded the progress in this field. Folding@Home and Rosetta@Home are examples of crowd-sourcing initiatives where the community is sharing computational resources, whereas RosettaCommons is an example of an initiative where a community is sharing a codebase for the development of computational algorithms. Foldit is another initiative where participants compete with each other in a protein folding video game to predict 3D structure. In the past few years, contact maps deep machine learning was introduced to the 3D structure prediction process, adding more information and increasing the accuracy of models significantly. In this review, we will take the reader in a journey of exploration from the beginnings to the most recent turnabouts, which have revolutionized the field of homology modeling. Moreover, we discuss the new trends emerging in this rapidly growing field.

AB  - A wide range of insects affect crop production and cause considerable yield losses. Difficulties reside on the development and adaptation of adequate strategies to predict insect pests for their timely management to ensure enhanced agricultural production. Several conceptual modelling frameworks have been proposed, and the choice of an approach depends largely on the objective of the model and the availability of data. This paper presents a summary of decades of advances in insect population dynamics, phenology models, distribution and risk mapping. Existing challenges on the modelling of insects are listed; followed by innovations in the field. New approaches include artificial neural networks, cellular automata (CA) coupled with fuzzy logic (FL), fractal, multi-fractal, percolation, synchronization and individual/agent-based approaches. A concept for assessing climate change impacts and providing adaptation options for agricultural pest management independently of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios is suggested. A framework for estimating losses and optimizing yields within crop production system is proposed and a summary on modelling the economic impact of pests control is presented. The assessment shows that the majority of known insect modelling approaches are not holistic; they only concentrate on a single component of the system, i.e. the pest, rather than the whole crop production system. We suggest system thinking as a possible approach for linking crop, pest, and environmental conditions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of agricultural crop production.

AB  - Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) characteristics such as limited resources, shared channel, unpredictable mobility, improper load balancing, and variation in signal strength affect the routing of real-time multimedia data that requires Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning. Accurate prediction of the resource availability assists efficient resource allocation before the routing of such data. Most of the published work on resource prediction in MANET focuses on either bandwidth or energy without considering mobility effects. Adoption of intelligent software agent such as Cognitive Agent (CA) for the accurate resource prediction has a significant potential to solve the challenges of resource prediction in MANET. The intelligence provided in CA is similar to the logical thinking like a human for decision-making. The predominant CA architecture is the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, which performs the various tasks on behalf of the human user as an assistant. In this paper, we propose a CA-based Resource Prediction mechanism considering Mobility (CA-RPM) that predicts the resources using agents through the resource prediction agency consisting of one static agent, one cognitive agent and two mobile agents. Agents predict the traffic, mobility, buffer space, energy, and bandwidth effectively that is necessary for efficient resource allocation to support real-time and multimedia communications. The mobile agents collect and distribute network traffic statistics over MANET whereas a static agent collects the local statistics. CA creates static/mobile agent during the process of resource prediction. Initially, the designed time-series Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) predict traffic and mobility. Buffer space, energy, and bandwidth prediction use the predicted mobility and traffic. Simulation results show that the predicted resources closely match with the real values at the cost of little overheads due to the usage of agents. Simulation analysis of predicted traffic and mobility also shows the improvement compared to recurrent WNN in terms of mean square error, covariance, memory overhead, agent overhead and computation overhead. We plan to use these predicted resources for its efficient utilization in QoS routing is our future work.

AB  - The paper examines the impact of globalization on state capacity in Africa. It problematizes globalization as a central determining factor in building the capable state in Africa. Globalization, although it requires typologizing and contextualizing or historicizing, is used to refer to a complex set of interconnected multi-linear, multifaceted and dialectical and still unfolding historical processes, propelled by the transnationalization of finance capital, in search of new markets, and the logic of capital accumulation, and typically characterized by structural differentiation and unequal functional integration between metropolitan and dependent or satellite nations, peoples and markets. State capacity is used neither narrowly nor exclusively as human and physical resource capacity-building or capacity-enhancement, nor limited to econometric or statistical computations of gross domestic product or national income data, though it includes and requires both. Its use assumes a democratic, open, participatory, and socially inclusive political system, as important conditions for expanding and consolidating state capacity on a sustainable basis in Africa. The paper situates the problem of globalization for state capacity in Africa in the wider Pan African context. Historically, globalization has divided and balkanized African countries, carving out political, economic and cultural spheres of influence, and weakening their ability to act collectively to defend their common interests. Collective action by African countries to confront the challenges and opportunities of globalization requires new governance structures to strengthen African regional economic communities, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development, along lines that will, by democratizing decision-making and public political processes within their member-states, enhance state capacity in various sectors. Attributing the problematic character of state capacity in Africa to the massive problem of the structural condition of the African state, the paper argues that this is notably and significantly due to the contradictions arising from globalization and the dependent character of the African state, reflecting the lingering or residual colonial inheritance of dependent political and socioeconomic and psycho-cultural structures, institutions and processes, which are at the heart of the problem of state capacity in Africa. They reflect the dialectics or antinomies, the age-old or historically deep contradictory push and pull of globalization and localization or indigenization in Africa. The paper suggests that, resolving these antinomies or contradictions, requires the following: (a) Transforming contemporary globalization, on the basis of mutuality, recognition and reciprocity, emphasizing new Afrocentric epistemological foundations for thinking about African and global development, global social justice, global income redistribution, economic and socio-cultural rights, global inclusion, and global democracy. (b) Emphasizing the use of “appropriate” technologies, to ‘fit’ the lifestyles and social organizations of local communities, growing from them, requiring less reliance on outside experts and using more local expertise. (c) Re-designing new Pan-African approaches to state capacity, to strengthen the collective capacity of African continental and regional institutions to respond to globalization, turning its negative implications for Africa into opportunities to reform globalization, and make it truly global. (d) Reconceptualizing democracy, on the basis of the positive role of culture in generating and institutionalizing new modes of self-reliant, and transparent democratic governance.

AB  - This paper addresses the graduate-level control engineering curriculum change performed at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB), Medellin, Colombia. New proposed methodologies include active learning activities using a new multipurpose experimental test bed that was developed with industrial components. The renovated graduate-level control engineering related courses include: Continuous Processes, Discrete Processes, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, Linear Control, Nonlinear Control, and Optimal Estimation. The new experimental station was developed for teaching, research, and industrial training activities for the School of Engineering at the UPB. In this work, we report the use of the station in an Optimal Estimation course to replace a traditional homework/exams evaluation approach with an applied work that required independent study, the implementation of different observers in a real lab-scale industrial plant, and a paper-style written report. Increasing independent study activities resulted in academic discussions that are valuable for the learning process of the student. The use of the experimental station and the real comparison of estimation algorithms, implemented by using industrial controllers and high-level programming environments, provided the student skills that cannot be acquired by using only simulations in which real implementation restrictions/challenges do not appear. This work represents one of the first approaches for the implementation of the new curriculum model at the UPB for graduate education. The methodology used in the Optimal Estimation class promoted independent learning, critical thinking and writing skills through significant learning activities.

AB  - Summary
Formal thought disorder (FTD) is present in most psychiatric disorders and in some healthy individuals. In this Review, we present a comprehensive, integrative, and multilevel account of what is known about FTD, covering genetic, cellular, and neurotransmitter effects, environmental influences, experimental psychology and neuropsychology, brain imaging, phenomenology, linguistics, and treatment. FTD is a dimensional, phenomenologically defined construct, which can be clinically subdivided into positive versus negative and objective versus subjective symptom clusters. Because FTDs have been traditionally linked to schizophrenia, studies in other diagnoses are scarce. Aetiologically, FTD is the only symptom under genetic influence in schizophrenia as shown in linkage studies, but familial communication patterns (allusive thinking) have also been associated with the condition. Positive FTDs are related to synaptic rarefication in the glutamate system of the superior and middle lateral temporal cortices. Cortical volume of the left superior temporal gyrus is decreased in patients with schizophrenia who have positive FTD in structural MRI studies and shows reversed hemispheric (right more than left) activation in functional MRI experiments during speech production. Semantic network dysfunction in positive FTD has been demonstrated in experiments of indirect semantic hyperpriming (reaction time). In acute positive FTD, antipsychotics are effective, but a subgroup of patients have treatment-resistant, chronic, positive or negative FTD. Specific psychotherapy as treatment for FTD has not yet been developed. With this solid data on the pathogenesis of FTD, we can now implement clinical studies to treat this condition.

AB  - This paper considers the origins and development of the concept mapping methodology, a summary of its growth, and its influence in a variety of fields. From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, “bridging” index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development.

AB  - The outputs of ecological models often need to be projected several years, or decades, into the future. The psychological literature tells us that stakeholders rarely think of such a distant future and when they do, they employ cognitive styles different from the ones commonly used for planning and decision making, which the ecological models are designed to facilitate. This may affect the reception of modelling efforts in several ways. Stakeholders may question the very purpose of trying to say anything meaningful about such a distant future; may consider model outputs as irrelevant to planning; or may provide emotional, often unconscious, responses motivated by deeply held fears and aspirations. Modellers too may display some of these behaviours. Here, we review the relevant literature and describe a questionnaire a modeller could use to explore these issues within a stakeholder group. We also report an experiment which shows how the very act of answering the questionnaire can significantly change the perception of future time horizon and future concerns and discuss the possible implications for modelling projects.

AB  - Background
Emotion regulation therapy (ERT) promotes resilience in distress disorders by strengthening attentional and metacognitive capacities. Regulation skills are presented with the goal of ameliorating the perseverative negative thinking (PNT) that characterizes these disorders. This study tested ERT in a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of 16-session (ERT16) versus 8-session (ERT8) doses.
Method
Patients (N = 72) endorsing elevated worry and/or rumination and meeting diagnostic criteria for a distress disorder were randomized to ERT8 or ERT16. PNT, anxiety/depressive symptoms, functioning/quality of life, and treatment mechanisms (attention shifting, attention focusing, decentering, reappraisal) were measured at pre, mid, and post treatment. Clinical symptom severity was also assigned via diagnostic interview at each timepoint.
Results
ERT produced significant improvements across outcomes. ERT16 showed an advantage over ERT8 for distress disorder severity, worry, rumination, and attention shifting from pre-post treatment. Changes in ERT treatment mechanisms mediated changes in clinical improvement.
Conclusion
These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of two doses of ERT in reducing PNT and distress through improvements in regulation skills.

AB  - Reference evapotranspiration is a critical hydrological measurement closely associated with agriculture. Accurate forecasting is vital in effective water management and crop planning in sustainable agriculture. In this study, the future values of reference evapotranspiration are forecasted by applying a recurrent long short-term memory neural network optimized using the Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm, a novel bioinspired metaheuristic based on the spread of COVID-19. The input data is sourced from the Sistema Agrometeorológico para a Gestão da Rega no Alentejo, in Portugal, with meteorological data such as air temperature or wind speed. Several baseline models are applied to the same problem to facilitate comparisons, including support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron, Lasso and decision tree. The results demonstrate the successful forecasting performance of the proposed model and its potential in this field. In turn, to gain deeper insights into the model’s inner workings, the SHapley Additive exPlanation tool is applied for explainability. Consequently, the study identifies the most relevant variables for reference evapotranspiration forecasting, including previously measured evapotranspiration values. Additionally, a univariable model is tested using historic evapotranspiration values as input, offering a comparable performance with a considerable reduction of computational time.

AB  - This article delves into the challenge of successful entrepreneurship in the energy industry under conditions of uncertainty by examining the case of John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, which rapidly seized control of an initially-uncertain industry. It finds that Rockefeller cemented control through a willingness to internalise contextual uncertainty (related to the nature of the energy business) as a stepping stone to managing contractual uncertainty (related to transactions with other parties). This finding suggests that thinking sequentially about the management of contextual and contractual uncertainty aids entrepreneurial success in the field of energy. This suggestion accords with standing calls in the transaction costs literature, which means that findings may generalise to some extent. However, the exploratory nature of the analysis implies the need for further research about the argument’s compatibility with modern energy practices and its generalisability.

Risk is an inevitable part of all human activity. Similarly sized earthquakes can have very different impacts in different countries depending on the degree of engineering input into the design and construction of the facilities. In this chapter we will propose an approach based on systems thinking and new systems boundaries. We will identify and characterise three different sources of uncertainty: hard physical system parameter uncertainty, hard system model uncertainty and soft system human uncertainty. We will explore ways in which evidence from previously disparate sources can be managed in an integrated way.

AB  - This chapter analyzes the shifting construct of ableist subjectivities that lie at the heart of a modernity-colonialism-racialization vortex and that were entangled with humanism's rise. Drawing on and building on the work of Sylvia Wynter, it examines how a “figure of Man” in three different but related iterations helped shape ontological hierarchies and violent inclusions/exclusions. It illustrates these moves via whitestream scholarship that came to dominate certain geopolitical locales from the 1600s, 1800s, and 2000s and that subsequently spread. From discourses of capacity (tutoring children), to ability (compulsory schooling), to automation (systems theory and computational superintelligence), the figure of Man not only overrepresents for “the human” but also puts in jeopardy all lives and ways of being beyond its exclusive borders. The questions that remain for education exceed standard policy debates about school reform, inclusive schooling, or evaluation, pointing instead toward a wider planetary context, existential issues, and power relations that sit within the tensions between “Man's” exclusivity, “the human's” idiosyncracies and primacy, and the potential rewriting/erasure of both via new technologies.

AB  - In their 1987 Nature publication, “Mitochondrial DNA and Human Evolution,” Rebecca Cann, Mark Stoneking, and Allan C. Wilson gave a new reconstruction of human evolution on the basis of differences in mitochondrial DNA among contemporary human populations. This phylogeny included an African common ancestor for all human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages, and Cann et al.’s reconstruction became known as the “Out of Africa” hypothesis. Since mtDNA is inherited exclusively through the maternal line, the common ancestor who was first branded African Eve later became known as Mitochondrial Eve (mtEve, for short). In this paper, I show that mtEve was not a single, successful, or purely scientific discovery. Instead, she was produced many times and in many ways, each of which informed the next. Importantly, though Wilson and colleagues heralded mitochondrial DNA as a source of certainty, objectivity, and consensus for evolutionary inference, their productions of Mitochondrial Eve depended as much on popular assumptions about the certainty of maternal inheritance as they did on new molecular and computational tools. This recognition lets us reevaluate the complex consequences of these productions, which, like mtEve herself, could not be confined to a purely social, material, or scientific dimension.

AB  - A data-driven methodology is proposed, for the investigation of the ultimate response of masonry arches. Aiming to evaluate their structural response in a computationally efficient framework, machine learning metamodels, in the form of artificial neural networks, are adopted. Datasets are numerically built, integrating Matlab, Python and commercial finite element software. Heyman’s assumptions are adopted within non-linear finite element analysis, incorporating contact-friction laws between adjacent stones, to capture failure in the arch. The artificial neural networks are trained, validated, and tested using the least square minimization technique. It is shown that the proposed scheme can be used to provide a fast and accurate prediction of the deformed geometry, the collapse mechanism and the ultimate load. Cases studies demonstrate the efficiency of the method in random, new arch geometries. Relevant Matlab/Python scripts and datasets are provided. The method can be extended towards structural health monitoring and the concept of digital twin.

AB  - In many countries across the world a universal issue of growing concern is increasing demand for health services and corresponding escalating costs. While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services. This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.

For the first time, music chosen to trigger specific emotional responses was directly and cross-culturally compared with music chosen as crossmodally congruent with specific taste/flavors (the latter usually referred to as ‘sonic seasoning’). The effects triggered by ‘emotional’ music were more prominent than those triggered by ‘crossmodally-corresponding’ music. Specifically, chocolate was liked more, rated as sweeter, and the purchase intent was higher, when tasted while listening to music that conveyed positive, as compared to negative, emotion. By contrast, the same chocolate was mostly rated as tasting more bitter with the negative music, as compared to the positive music. Companies looking to use sonic seasoning in marketing strategies, should therefore principally aim at intelligently classifying music based on the likely emotions that they can trigger in their customers (at least when thinking globally).

AB  - Conceptual design is a pivotal stage for new product development that relies more on designers to solve open-ended and ill-defined problems. Situated function-behavior-structure ontology is an acknowledged method to facilitate conceptual design in a goal-oriented way. However, it depends on the subjective cognition abilities of designers, which are influenced by limited memory and reasoning capacities. Developing computer-aided methods grounded in this ontology holds significant promise in enhancing designers' cognitive abilities. This study delves into the function-behavior (F-B) mapping process. It explores the effect of working memory and long-term memory on design cognition and introduces a memory-inspired reinforcement learning framework for F-B mapping. The Markov decision process is then adopted to formalize F-B mapping while motivation-driven Q learning is employed by the design agent to learn knowledge from historical design cases. The learned state-action value matrix can be applied to guide the designer in selecting feasible behaviors for the specific function requirement. The proposed approach empowers design agents with self-learning and self-evolving capacities. A case study on the F-B mapping of a traction system is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter considers some of the ways in which nonlinear dynamics is changing the science of ecology. Specifically, it considers a bit of history; namely, debates over the stability of populations and communities in population and community ecology. Further, it explores arguments over population regulation in population ecology and the debate over diversity-complexity-stability in community ecology. This serves to highlight how ecological systems have been evaluated with the tools and assumptions of linear dynamical systems. Second, it turns to some conceptual issues. That is, what different concepts of stability are at work in ecology. Additionally, it provides a taxonomy of these concepts and how they are related to one another. Unfortunately, many of these concepts are mostly applicable when thinking of linear systems. As an example of nonlinear dynamics in ecology, it considers the case of deterministic chaos. Using very simple discrete difference equations suited for insect populations, for example, one can see the characteristic of sensitivity to initial conditions. Finally, it discusses the impact of complex systems analysis on issues in and around ecology. Specifically, it examines the rise of “resilience thinking” and debates over ecological laws as examples of how nonlinear dynamics is challenging ecological theory and practice.

AB  - In this study we provide a computerized graph structure for synthesizing and displaying the data on a region’s ecosystem-economic system. By applying Mathematica-based graph modeling we create a causal network of the synergistic impact mechanism among certain climate related factors. Our computational approach identifies a climate factor that affects most immediately or most strongly the others. Important factors are indicated through the use of graph theoretical tools. Our graph-based approach and its computational aspects allow for factor ranking(s) according to their importance to the network both numerically and visually, for certain settlement types. Our contribution provides quantitative estimates of impacts and adaptation potentials of five potential effects of climate change (migration, flooding-landslides-fire, air and water pollution, human health and energy-water-other resources) which play a substantial role at the synergistic impact mechanism. By using graph visualization techniques, the structure of the synergistic impact mechanism is self-evident. Specifically, graph layouts are created to detect i) the causal relationships of the synergistic mechanism under study ii) the most influential factor(s) in the synergistic mechanism and iii) classify the factor’s roles (based on the degree of their impact) within the coping mechanism. Highlighting graph elements let information for policy implications stand out.

AB  - This paper introduces a new concept of least community that is as homogeneous as a random graph, and develops a new community detection algorithm from the perspective of homogeneity or heterogeneity. Based on this concept, we adopt head/tail breaks–a newly developed classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution–and rely on edge betweenness given its heavy-tailed distribution to iteratively partition a network into many heterogeneous and homogeneous communities. Surprisingly, the derived communities for any self-organized and/or self-evolved large networks demonstrate very striking power laws, implying that there are far more small communities than large ones. This notion of far more small things than large ones constitutes a new fundamental way of thinking for community detection.

AB  - Data selection is commonly used to reduce costs and energy usage by training on a subset of available data. However, determining the appropriate subset size requires extensive dataset knowledge and experimentation, limiting transferability. Varying the validation set also produces unstable results and wastes computational resources. In this paper, we propose a data selection method for dynamically determining subset ratios based on model performance using only a training set. The data search space is narrowed through weighted sampling, leveraging statistical selection patterns. Parallel analysis of class distributions identifies the most representative samples with high selection potential. Extensive experiments validate our approach and demonstrate improved training efficiency. Our method speeds up various subset ratios by up to 2.2x on CIFAR-10, 1.9x on CIFAR-100, 2.0x on TinyImageNet, and 2.3x on ImageNet with negligible accuracy drops.

AB  - Two theories of current interest and of mathematical and computational substance concerning knowledge assessment in education are discussed. These are the theory of knowledge structures and the theory of Bayesian networks as specifically related to educational assessment. In four separate sections, the two theories are compared by considering the sets of variables involved in their models, the set-theoretical and relational constructs defined on those variables, the probabilistic assumptions and properties, and the problems addressed by the theories in constructing their models. For the comparison, a common-base system of symbols and terms is adopted, which overcomes the peculiarities of expression in the corresponding streams of literature. This system gives us a better recognition of the similarities and differences between the two paradigms, and a precise appreciation of their arguments and abilities.

AB  - The Food-Energy–Water (FEW) nexus has been promoted as a tool for improving food, energy, and water resource security via an interdisciplinary approach that acknowledges the inherent synergies and tradeoffs involved in managing these resources. Over the past decade discussion of the nexus has increased rapidly, along with research funding and output. However, because the nexus encompasses so many different disciplines, researchers engage with and study the nexus from differing perspectives with distinct motivations and analytical methodologies. Understanding these motivations is critical to understanding the value of a given work. This paper first uses a narrative review to identify the motivations and toolsets of five key perspectives used to view the nexus, including: ecosystem health, waste management, public and private institutional change, stakeholder trust, and the learning process. Then, a systematic review is conducted to examine how publication trends have changed over the past decade, both generally and for each of these perspectives. The Food-Energy-Water nexus is not the first systems-based approach for addressing resource management and critiques of the nexus as a “Buzzword” or simply a reinvention of previous systems are growing in the literature. Challenging authors to explicitly define the role and motivations of their research within the broader category of the FEW nexus can improve the actionability of the research, better allow researchers to build from each other's work, and help reduce the ambiguity surrounding the nexus.

AB  - The aim of this work is to develop a numerical computation program allowing designing new contours of a supersonic axisymmetric nozzle having two expansions at the throat, named by DEN (Dual Expansion Nozzle). This new nozzle gives a uniform and parallel flow at the exit section, to improve considerably the performances compared to the conventional Minimum Length Nozzle (MLN), and the Best Performances Nozzle (BPN). The present nozzle has a two unknowns external and central body curved walls. Each of them is started by an initial expansion angle to give a uniform and horizontal flow at the exit section. Two others transition regions are calculated in parallel with the contours points to give the desired exit Mach number. The walls are determined point by point by the High Temperature Method of Characteristics (HT MOC) model. The resolution of the four compatibility and characteristics equations is done numerically by the finite difference predictor corrector algorithm. The validation of the results is controlled by the convergence of the calculated critical sections ratio to that given by the theory. The design depends on four parameters, where MLN and BPN become special cases of DEN. A comparison is made with MLN, since it is currently used in the aerospace propulsion and with BPN aiming to improve their performances. The comparison is made for the same critical mass flow rate. The results demonstrate a remarkable reduction up of 45 %, and 52 % in the mass of DEN when the exit Mach number ME = 3.00 and the stagnation temperature T0 = 2000 K. The application is made for air and for future aerospace missiles in order to improve their trajectory parameters. The chosen example demonstrates an improvement of 13 % and 16 % on the missile range compared, respectively to MLN, and BPN.

AB  - Data is always a crucial issue of concern especially during its prediction and computation in digital revolution. This paper exactly helps in providing efficient learning mechanism for accurate predictability and reducing redundant data communication. It also discusses the Bayesian analysis that finds the conditional probability of at least two parametric based predictions for the data. The paper presents a method for improving the performance of Bayesian classification using the combination of Kalman Filter and K-means. The method is applied on a small dataset just for establishing the fact that the proposed algorithm can reduce the time for computing the clusters from data. The proposed Bayesian learning probabilistic model is used to check the statistical noise and other inaccuracies using unknown variables. This scenario is being implemented using efficient machine learning algorithm to perpetuate the Bayesian probabilistic approach. It also demonstrates the generative function for Kalman-filer based prediction model and its observations. This paper implements the algorithm using open source platform of Python and efficiently integrates all different modules to piece of code via Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) for Python.

The final formula is achieved via relating semicopulas with finite plane partitions.

AB  - Financial and economic crises are not always the same. It is important to understand why some episodes of crisis generate prolonged and systemic recessions. Developing the Financial Instability Hypothesis, Hyman Minsky introduced the idea that in periods of stability, financial actors tend to increase their risk exposure, moving from a stable hedge-dominated structure to an unstable one, characterized by speculative and ultra-speculative (Ponzi) financial positions: hence, stability turns out being destabilizing. Starting from the three different relationships introduced by Minsky (income–debt–hedge, speculative and Ponzi) for financial units, we involve a simple partial equilibrium agent-based model in which firms, the banking sector, the real and financial sides of the economy, interact. This theoretic framework is used as computational laboratory to extend the migration rates open system modelling based on the E(ntry)–S(tay)–L(eave) processes by considering the economic system, the business cycle and with attention to so-called zombie-firms.

With the worsening of crises around the world, many countries are in the process of expanding their armed forces, and coastal nations, in particular, are paying significant attention to their submarine weapons. However, as it is not only convenient to acquire submarines but also to operate them, it is necessary to define from where they will do so. Given the above, this current work aims to present a framework with a multimethodological focus, that is, presenting a combined use of the problem structuring method (PSM) Strategic Choice Approach with the multicriteria method MPSI-MARA. As a result, the ordering of some points along the Brazilian coast, made non-specific, is presented as a suggestion for the implementation of new Submarine Bases and/or Naval Support Stations.

AB  - In the study of human pose estimation, which is widely used in safety and sports scenes, the performance of deep learning methods is greatly reduced in high overlap rate and crowded scenes. Therefore, we propose a bottom-up model, called BalanceHRNet, which is based on balanced high-resolution module and a new branch attention module. BalanceHRNet draws on the multi-branch structure and fusion method of a popular model HigherHRNet. And our model overcomes the shortcoming of HigherHRNet that cannot obtain a large enough receptive field. Specifically, through the connecting structure in balanced high-resolution module, we can connect almost all convolutional layers and obtain a sufficiently large receptive field. At the same time, the multi-resolution representation can be maintained due to the use of balanced high-resolution module, which enable our model to recognize objects with richer scales and obtain more complex semantics information. And for branch fusion method, we design branch attention to obtain the importance of different branches at different stages. Finally, our model improves the accuracy while ensuring a smaller amount of computation than HigherHRNet. The CrowdPose dataset is used as test dataset, and HigherHRNet, AlphaPose, OpenPose and so on are taken as comparison models. The AP measured by BalanceHRNet is 63.0%, increased by 3.1% compared to best model — HigherHRNet. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the COCO(2017) keypoint detection dataset. Compared with HigherHRNet-w32, the AP of our model is improved by 1.6%.

AB  - Recently, the idea of smart cities has made several strides forward in literature. Work has hypothesize that the combination of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and High powered computers will make technology more human-centric, even, the idea that smart cities will be able to understand the thought process of a human being seems very much likely today. This paper is along this line of thought. In particular, we try to present a method to model the cognitive state of human interest. This is done to take one more step towards the realization of a smart cognitive city. An approach which is Subjective–Objective in nature is presented to model the computation of activity inspired by interest. Based on activity, human latent state values are indirectly deduced. Inspiration is drawn from Physics and interest is modeled upon the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Concepts of Adaptive filtering are used to formulate an evolving transformation function that automatically and adaptively models the conversion of interest into activity. Particle filter is employed to provide an elucidation which is computationally feasible. To validate the viability of the method, experimentation is performed with real datasets.

AB  - In the era of the IoT revolution, applications are becoming ever more sophisticated and accompanied by diverse functional and non-functional requirements, including those related to computing resources and performance levels. Such requirements make the development and implementation of these applications complex and challenging. Computing models, such as cloud computing, can provide applications with on-demand computation and storage resources to meet their needs. Although cloud computing is a great enabler for IoT and endpoint devices, its limitations make it unsuitable to fulfill all design goals of novel applications and use cases. Instead of only relying on cloud computing, leveraging and integrating resources at different layers (like IoT, edge, and cloud) is necessary to form and utilize a computing continuum. The layers’ integration in the computing continuum offers a wide range of innovative services, but it introduces new challenges (e.g., monitoring performance and ensuring security) that need to be investigated. A better grasp and more profound understanding of the computing continuum can guide researchers and developers in tackling and overcoming such challenges. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive and unified view of the computing continuum. The paper discusses computing models in general with a focus on cloud computing, the computing models that emerged beyond the cloud, and the communication technologies that enable computing in the continuum. In addition, two novel reference architectures are presented in this work: one for edge–cloud computing models and the other for edge–cloud communication technologies. We demonstrate real use cases from different application domains (like industry and science) to validate the proposed reference architectures, and we show how these use cases map onto the reference architectures. Finally, the paper highlights key points that express the authors’ vision about efficiently enabling and utilizing the computing continuum in the future.

AB  - This work seeks to explore the potential of bottom-up generative processes in the context of conlang production, aiming to describe the basis of a new field of research: Self-Organized Linguistic Systems or SOLS, specified under the perspective of both self-organized systems and constructed languages. SOLS approach provides a framework for the creation of self-generated artificial languages and may serve as a starting point for the development of context-dependent or domain-specific languages. It acknowledges that the development of conlangs can happen in artificial societies of simple agents, as the output of social interactions in computational simulations under the agent-based modelling paradigm. In the proposed initial SOLS model, automatic generation of lexicon takes place in the context of a digital environment with objects, actions and agents with embodied cognition through peer-to-peer interactions. Specifically, this paper exposes how SOLS can be developed with bi-dimensional games and simulations. An initial work has been done with the xmunch-atomspace and the SciArt simulator, which constitute the first implementations of both our knowledge representation toolbox and our bi-dimensional simulator of P2P Social Dynamics. Non-interactive agent-based SOLS can allow artificial agents to independently evolve emergent languages as part of their self-organizing or adaptation processes.

KW  - Sparse polynomial systems
KW  - Toric varieties
AB  - We study polynomial systems with prescribed monomial supports in the Cox ring of a toric variety built from a complete polyhedral fan. We present combinatorial formulas for the dimension of their associated subvarieties under genericity assumptions on the coefficients of the polynomials. Using these formulas, we identify at which degrees generic systems in polytopal algebras form regular sequences. Our motivation comes from sparse elimination theory, where knowing the expected dimension of these subvarieties leads to specialized algorithms and to large speed-ups for solving sparse polynomial systems. As a special case, we classify the degrees at which regular sequences defined by weighted homogeneous polynomials can be found, answering an open question in the Gröbner bases literature. We also show that deciding whether a sparse system is generically a regular sequence in a polytopal algebra is hard from the point of view of theoretical computational complexity.

AB  - The rapid rise in global energy consumption and its consequences on climate change has made incorporating renewable energy sources like solar photovoltaics into the building envelope easier. However, in spite of extensive uses and significant technological advances, the lower solar panel efficiencies caused by high temperatures remain a significant barrier to the viability of deploying photovoltaic technology in regions with hot climates utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This research examines the cooling effectiveness of air-cooled photovoltaic (PV) under the climate of Nablus - Palestine. This study presents a numerical model designed to cool solar panels using various air-cooled channel configurations. Rectangular fins made of high thermal conductivity materials such as copper were used in this study. The parametric study was based on the changing baseplate thickness, fin spacing, height, and thickness through a stepwise optimization process to enhance the heat transfer mechanism. The results show that the optimum design of average volume temperatures for the PV cell models in air-cooled channel configurations with and without fins were 40.28 °C and 42.58 °C, respectively. The optimum design was obtained at 3, 110, 60, and 4 mm for baseplate thickness, fin spacing, height, and thickness, respectively. This optimum design was responsible for the average PV panel temperature drop by 1.6 %, 1.3 %, 5.9 %, and 6.2 % for baseplate thickness, fin spacing, height, and thickness, respectively. The optimum design of an air-cooled cooling channel for PV is an important insight provided by this work, and it may help in the future development of more effective and affordable cooling methods.

AB  - Process safety and risk management remain a significant challenge for the process and manufacturing industries. Digital systems have been applied over many decades to assist in process safety management throughout the lifecycle of a process plant. There has been much hype in recent years regarding Industry 4.0, digitalization and digital twins regarding the transformative potential that exists within these technologies to improve operational performance and reduce process safety accidents. In this article, a fundamental systems thinking approach is applied to the implementation of the digital twin within the process industries. The importance of having a standardized language and ontology, such as ISO15926, enables the use of reasoning engines and the ability to interconnect models and systems across the process and product lifecycle. We discuss use-cases and forms of the digital twin to improve safety within the process industries. A specific focus shows how an operator training simulator and its embedded dynamic models are applied within this environment. The article concludes with a summary of process safety related opportunities and threats associated with the application of digitalized dynamic models in industry.

AB  - The Shapley value equals a player's contribution to the potential of a game. The potential is a most natural one-number summary of a game, which can be computed as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition of the players. This computation integrates the coalition formation of all players and readily extends to games with externalities. We investigate those potential functions for games with externalities that can be computed this way. It turns out that the potential that corresponds to the MPW solution introduced by Macho-Stadler et al. (2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339–356) is unique in the following sense. It is obtained as the expected accumulated worth of a random partition, it generalizes the potential for games without externalities, and it induces a solution that satisfies the null player property even in the presence of externalities.

AB  - Hierarchy is a major organizational principle of the cortex and underscores modern computational theories of cortical function. The local microcircuit amplifies long-distance inter-areal input, which show distance-dependent changes in their laminar profiles. Statistical modeling of these changes in laminar profiles demonstrates that inputs from multiple hierarchical levels to their target areas show remarkable consistency, allowing the construction of a cortical hierarchy based on a principle of hierarchical distance. The statistical modeling that is applied to structure can also be applied to laminar differences in the oscillatory coherence between areas thereby determining a functional hierarchy of the cortex. Close examination of the anatomy of inter-areal connectivity reveals a dual counterstream architecture with well-defined distance-dependent feedback and feedforward pathways in both the supra- and infragranular layers, suggesting a multiplicity of feedback pathways with well-defined functional properties. These findings are consistent with feedback connections providing a generative network involved in a wide range of cognitive functions. A dynamical model constrained by connectivity data sheds insight into the experimentally observed signatures of frequency-dependent Granger causality for feedforward versus feedback signaling. Concerted experiments capitalizing on recent technical advances and combining tract-tracing, high-resolution fMRI, optogenetics and mathematical modeling hold the promise of a much improved understanding of lamina-constrained mechanisms of neural computation and cognition. However, because inter-areal interactions involve cortical layers that have been the target of important evolutionary changes in the primate lineage, these investigations will need to include human and non-human primate comparisons.

AB  - The present article deals with the question of how the difficulty of a text affects a reader's tendency to engage in task-unrelated thinking (mind wandering) during reading, and the potential role of topic interest as a mediator of the relation between text difficulty and mind wandering. Two-hundred and sixteen participants read three texts with each text either being easy, moderate, or difficult in terms of readability and cohesion. From time to time during reading, participants were interrupted and required to indicate whether they were voluntarily or involuntarily engaging in mind wandering. After reading each text, they rated their interest in and familiarity with the topic, and subsequently answered a number of comprehension questions. The results revealed that reading difficult texts increased both voluntary and involuntary mind wandering and this increase partially explained the negative relation between text difficulty and comprehension. Furthermore, topic interest fully mediated the effect of text difficulty on both forms of mind wandering.

AB  - Analysts face many steep challenges when performing sensemaking tasks on collections of textual information larger than can be reasonably analyzed without computational assistance. To scale up such sensemaking tasks, new methods are needed to interactively integrate human cognitive sensemaking activity with machine learning. Towards that goal, we offer a human-in-the-loop computational model that mirrors the human sensemaking process, and consists of foraging and synthesis sub-processes. We model the synthesis loop as an interactive spatial projection and the foraging loop as an interactive relevance ranking combined with topic modeling. We combine these two components of the sensemaking process using semantic interaction such that the human's spatial synthesis actions are transformed into automated foraging and synthesis of new relevant information. Ultimately, the model's ability to forage as a result of the analyst's synthesis activities makes interacting with big text data easier and more efficient, thereby facilitating analysts' sensemaking ability. We discuss the interaction design and theory behind our interactive sensemaking model. The model is embodied in a novel visual analytics prototype called Cosmos in which analysts synthesize structure within the larger corpus by directly interacting with a reduced-dimensionality space to express relationships on a subset of data. We then demonstrate how Cosmos supports sensemaking tasks with a realistic scenario that investigates the affect of natural disasters in Adelaide, Australia in September 2016 using a database of over 30,000 news articles.

AB  - Predicting the outcomes of cyber-physical systems with multiple human interactions is a challenging problem. This article reviews a game theoretical approach to address this issue, where reinforcement learning is employed to predict the time-extended interaction dynamics. We explain that the most attractive feature of the method is proposing a computationally feasible approach to simultaneously model multiple humans as decision makers, instead of determining the decision dynamics of the intelligent agent of interest and forcing the others to obey certain kinematic and dynamic constraints imposed by the environment. We present two recent exploitations of the method to model (1) unmanned aircraft integration into the National Airspace System and (2) highway traffic. We conclude the article by providing ongoing and future work about employing, improving and validating the method. We also provide related open problems and research opportunities.

AB  - The impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise, are an increasing threat to the world’s coastal regions. Following recommendations made by the United Nations about the preservation of mangrove environments, particularly given their potential for effective natural defence against wave-driven hazards, a series of experiments have been conducted to quantify the ability of mangroves to counter climate change impacts. To date, these experiments have been limited by computational cost and inability to model multiple scenarios. With improved data quality and availability, machine learning has enormous potential to supplement, or even replace, existing numerical methods. This article presents both an outline of the importance of protecting mangrove environments and a review of methods currently used to quantify the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change impacts. In view of the limitations of existing numerical methods, the article also discusses the potential of machine learning as an efficient and effective alternative.

AB  - The core challenge in modeling bicyclist behavior dynamics is how to tackle the interaction between the lateral and the longitudinal movements. Further the bicycle transportation could be considered as multi-particle self-driven system. The combined dynamic model, psychological-physical force model (PPFM) and trajectories choice model (TCM), is proposed as a multi agent model to describe bicycle microscopic behavior dynamics. The PPFM is a continuous force model, which obeyed to the Newton's second law. By introducing the trajectories choice behavior in the tactical level, the TCM is modeled to describe the ability to individual autonomous thinking and to respond to changes ambient conditions for predefined behavior tank. Through designing computational experiments, the simulation data is collected to calibrate and validate the models. The simulation results show that the fundamental diagram obtained by simulation is dovetail into the empirical data. The PPFM is capable of describing the nonlinear interaction between individuals and the microscopic behavior of the proposed bicycle dynamic model with reasonable traffic.

AB  - A full understanding of cell signaling processes requires knowledge of protein structure–function relationships, protein–protein interactions, and the abilities of pathways to control phenotypes. Computational models offer a valuable framework for integrating that knowledge to predict the effects of system perturbations and interventions in health and disease. Whereas mechanistic models are well suited for understanding the biophysical basis for signal transduction and principles of therapeutic design, data-driven models are particularly suited to distill complex signaling relationships among samples and between multivariate signaling changes and phenotypes. Both approaches have limitations and provide incomplete representations of signaling biology, but their careful implementation and integration can provide new understanding for how manipulating system variables impacts cellular decisions.

AB  - Machine learning have been widely adopted in a variety of fields including engineering, science, and medicine revolutionizing how data is collected, used, and stored. Their implementation has led to a drastic increase in the number of computational models for the prediction of various numerical, categorical, or association events given input variables. We aim to examine recent advances in the use of machine learning when applied to the biomaterial field. Specifically, quantitative structure properties relationships offer the unique ability to correlate microscale molecular descriptors to larger macroscale material properties. These new models can be broken down further into four categories: regression, classification, association, and clustering. We examine recent approaches and new uses of machine learning in the three major categories of biomaterials: metals, polymers, and ceramics for rapid property prediction and trend identification. While current research is promising, limitations in the form of lack of standardized reporting and available databases complicates the implementation of described models. Herein, we hope to provide a snapshot of the current state of the field and a beginner's guide to navigating the intersection of biomaterials research and machine learning.
Statement of significance
Machine learning and its methods have found a variety of uses beyond the field of computer science but have largely been neglected by those in realm of biomaterials. Through the use of more computational methods, biomaterials development can be expediated while reducing the need for standard trial and error methods. Within, we introduce four basic models that readers can potentially apply to their current research as well as current applications within the field. Furthermore, we hope that this article may act as a “call to action” for readers to realize and address the current lack of implementation within the biomaterials field.

AB  - The presence of delays in a mathematical model can improve its vitality and suitability in describing several phenomena. However, in the presence of delays, nonlinear fractional differential equations are more difficult to study. This paper presents the use of a blend of variational iteration method with Sumudu transform for solving delay differential equations with Caputo derivatives of fractional variable order. Moreover, the paper introduces delays into the price adjustment equations to propose new price adjustment models with more potential for vitality and suitability. The paper assigns suitable real values to the parameters for the graphical display and comparison of the obtained solutions. The paper presents the interactions that exist among the price, demand, supply and dependence of supply and demand on the price, which can be applied to estimate the equilibrium price.

AB  - Emotion theory needs to explain the relationship of language and emotions, and the embodiment of emotions, by specifying the computational mechanisms underlying emotion generation in the brain. We used Chris Eliasmith’s Semantic Pointer Architecture to develop POEM, a computational model that explains numerous important phenomena concerning emotions, including how some stimuli generate immediate emotional reactions, how some emotional reactions depend on cognitive evaluations, how bodily states influence the generation of emotions, how some emotions depend on interactions between physiological inputs and cognitive appraisals, and how some emotional reactions concern syntactically complex representations. We contrast our theory with current alternatives, and discuss some possible applications to individual and social emotions.

AB  - An efficient and general multiscale strategy to model rough contact and determine the evolution of the real contact area is proposed, based on the splitting of the surface power spectrum. A multiplicative homogenisation scheme is developed to evaluate the contact area fraction effectively, by incorporating statistical information of the contact pressure field in the scale transitions. A strategy for separating the roughness frequencies and for generating the topography at each scale is proposed. The comparison between direct numerical simulation and the proposed multiscale strategy demonstrates the capability to predict the contact area evolution of multiscale rough topographies. The significant reduction of the computational cost endorses the applicability of the proposed multiscale framework to practical circumstances.

KW  - Three-way conflict analysis
AB  - Pawlak conflict analysis uses a three-valued situation table for representing the ratings of a set of agents on a set of issues. This paper examines a lattice-theoretic basis of three-way conflict analysis. Qualitatively, we adopt a triangle, namely, an MS.F-bilattice, to characterize the structures of agents ratings, which gives an intuitive and effective tool for ordering a single agent and a pair of agents. We consider a strength ordering and a rating ordering to construct MS.F-bilattices. By applying the principles of three-way decision as thinking in threes, we trisect, according to the rating ordering, the nine pairs of ratings into three regions: potential opposition (PO), potential conflict (PC), and potential support (PS) regions. For each region, according to the strength ordering, we construct the weak, medium, and strong three subregions. Quantitatively, we introduce opposition-alliance and support-alliance measures based on the rating ordering for one issue to trisect these pairs of ratings into PO, PC, and PS regions. We study opposition strength, conflict strength, and support strength measures based on strength ordering for one issue to trisect each of the three regions into three subregions. Finally, we extend the five types of measures for a set of issues. The lattice-theoretic model of three-way conflict analysis clarifies the semantics of pairs of ratings by two agents and gives a different perspective on trisection methods in conflict analysis. To demonstrate the value of the proposed methods, we analyze a case study of the development planning of the Gansu Province of China.

AB  - Intelligence of physical agents, such as human-made (e.g., robots, autonomous cars) and biological (e.g., animals, plants) ones, is not only enabled by their computational intelligence (CI) in their brain, but also by their physical intelligence (PI) encoded in their body. Therefore, it is essential to advance the PI of human-made agents as much as possible, in addition to their CI, to operate them in unstructured and complex real-world environments like the biological agents. This article gives a perspective on what PI paradigm is, when PI can be more significant and dominant in physical and biological agents at different length scales and how bioinspired and abstract PI methods can be created in agent bodies. PI paradigm aims to synergize and merge many research fields, such as mechanics, materials science, robotics, mechanical design, fluidics, active matter, biology, self-assembly and collective systems, to enable advanced PI capabilities in human-made agent bodies, comparable to the ones observed in biological organisms. Such capabilities would progress the future robots and other machines beyond what can be realized using the current frameworks.

AB  - Synthesizing prior research, this paper designs a relatively comprehensive and holistic characterization of business analytics – one that serves as a foundation on which researchers, practitioners, and educators can base their studies of business analytics. As such, it serves as an initial ontology for business analytics as a field of study. The foundation has three main parts dealing with the whence and whither of business analytics: identification of dimensions along which business analytics possibilities can be examined, derivation of a six-class taxonomy that covers business analytics perspectives in the literature, and design of an inclusive framework for the field of business analytics. In addition to unifying the literature, a major contribution of the designed framework is that it can stimulate thinking about the nature, roles, and future of business analytics initiatives. We show how this is done by deducing a host of unresolved issues for consideration by researchers, practitioners, and educators. We find that business analytics involves issues quite aside from data management, number crunching, technology use, systematic reasoning, and so forth.

However, there are some introductory papers of present author posted on Diagnostic Congress in Cracow (Cempel, in press [11]), and Diagnostyka Journal as well. But it seems to be further need to make such approach from different sides in order to see, if some new knowledge and technology will emerge. In doing this we need at first to define the ideal final result (IFR) of our innovation problem. As a next we need a set of parameters to describe the problems of system condition monitoring (CM) in terms of TRIZ language and set of inventive principles possible to apply, on the way to IFR. This means we should present the machine CM problem by means of contradiction and contradiction matrix. When specifying the problem parameters and inventive principles, one should use analogy and metaphorical thinking, which by definition is not exact but fuzzy, and leads sometimes to unexpected results and outcomes. The paper undertakes this important problem again and brings some new insight into system and machine CM problems. This may mean for example the minimal dimensionality of TRIZ engineering parameter set for the description of machine CM problems, and the set of most useful inventive principles applied to given engineering parameter and contradictions of TRIZ.

KW  - Attention
AB  - Medical image segmentation plays a key role in the diagnosis of spinal diseases. Unet has become a universal structure for image segmentation because of its unique skip connection structure in recent years. However, since Unet uses small-kernel convolution, the relationship between remote features is difficult to obtain due to the small receptive fields, and the key information cannot be highlighted, resulting in insufficient edge information. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes multiscale large-kernel convolution Unet (MLKCA-Unet), which develops MLKC block for effective feature extraction. Large-kernel convolution with different convolution kernels is used according to the feature map. For large feature maps, smaller large- kernel convolution is used, and for small feature maps, larger large-kernel convolution is used. All large-kernel convolution can be reduced the dimension by 1 × 1 convolution kernel. This method has a significant reduction in computation. By paralleling each large kernel convolution branch with the 3 × 3 convolution branch, it helps to capture detailed information. At the same time, an attention mechanism is added to the network to emphasize rich feature areas and enhance useful information. Finally, various indicators are employed to evaluate the network’s accuracy, similarity and speed, including IOU, DSC, TPR, PPV, and ET. The published spinesagt2wdataset3 spinal MRI image dataset is adopted in the experiment. The IOU, DSC, TPR, PPV, and ET on the test set are 0.8302, 0.9017, 0.9000, 0.9051 and 70 s/epoch respectively. The experimental result shows that MLKCA-Unet demonstrates superior segmentation performance and robustness, which can be well extended to other medical image segmentation.

AB  - The development of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has not followed the usual patterns of scientific validation required by engineering methods. Consequently, its outreach within engineering design is interpreted differently in the scholarly community. At the same time, the claimed powerful support in tackling technical problems of any degree of difficulty conflicts with TRIZ diffusion in industrial settings, which is relatively low according to insights into product development practices. The mismatch between ambitious goals and moderate spill-over benefits in the industry ranges among the various open issues concerning TRIZ, its way of thinking, its effectiveness, the usability of its tools. In order to provide a general overview of TRIZ in science, the authors have attempted to analyse reliable and influential sources from the literature. The performed survey includes the top 100 indexed publications concerning TRIZ, according to the number of received citations. Variegated and poorly interconnected research directions emerge in the abundant literature that tackles TRIZ-related topics. The outcomes of the investigation highlight the successful implementation of TRIZ within, among the others, biomimetics and information processing. The traditional borders of mechanical and industrial engineering have been frequently crossed, as the use of TRIZ is also witnessed in the domain of business and services. At the same time, computer-aided platforms represent diffused attempts to boost TRIZ diffusion and applicability.

In this study, a new fishtail impeller was introduced to improve the mixing of fluids in the stirred tank. The validity of the numerical model was first demonstrated by PIV experiments. Secondly, the CFD technique was used to analyze and predict the flow field characteristics in the stirred tank. Also, the effect of blade inclination on the mixing effect is analyzed. Finally, a comparative Analysis with the whale tail impeller is carried out to demonstrate the superiority of this research work. The results show that The results of the study showed that the power number of the fishtail impeller was reduced by 16.4 % compared to the RT impeller. The pumping efficiency of the fishtail impeller was increased by 25.52 %. The results also show that increasing the blade inclination increases the turbulent kinetic energy in the stirred tank. Comparative analysis with the whale-tail impeller reveals that the power number of the fish-tail impeller is reduced by 17.2 % and the pumping efficiency is increased by 19.97 %.

AB  - Investment decision-making in India is different from the world and is affected by social settings. Religion lies at the core of the prevailing socio-cultural environment strengthening social-norms and belief-system, while consciousness is considered core ingredient of life which improves awareness beyond the physical plane, not attributable to cortical processes. Although socio-cultural influence on economic behaviour is quite discernible in countries following eastern-religious traditions, yet studies examining its impact on decision efficacy are scant. Present research addresses this and explores causal role of religiosity and consciousness in shaping investor’s intuitive and analytical abilities. Following a multi-step procedure with qualitative procedure – using engaged scholarship of experts in participative research model and quantitative assessment – surveying investors, the role of these innate behavioural variables in investment decision making has been examined. The paper also validates ambidextrous decision-making style in investment efficacy where intuition improves analytical thinking which further enhances investment efficacy.

AB  - This article provides an overview of some perspectives about special issues in classroom mathematical teaching and learning that have stemmed from the huge explosion of research in children's mathematical thinking stimulated by Piaget. It concentrates on issues that are particularly important for less-advanced learners and for those who might be having special difficulties in learning mathematics. A major goal of the article is to develop a framework for understanding what effective mathematics teaching and learning is, because doing so is so important for struggling students and for research about them. Piaget's research had a fundamental influence on the on-going tension between understanding and fluency in the classroom, supporting efforts toward increasing understanding. But in some countries, misinterpretations of Piaget led to practices that are counterproductive for children, especially struggling learners. Such misinterpretations are identified and a more balanced approach that also draws on Vygotsky is described—a learning-path developmentally-appropriate learning/teaching approach.

AB  - This paper reports findings from a systematic search of the empirical literature from 2000 to 2020 on the assessment of creativity in narrative writing. It seeks to synthesise the designs, methods and findings on how different disciplines have gathered relevant data to the question of how creativity in writing might be assessed, and feedback made more effective. It draws together the established knowledge base around two research questions. The methodology for the systematic involved searches on five academic databases for relevant keywords, producing 1796 papers. Initial screening of the abstracts identified 97 studies for further scrutiny, and for which full texts were accessed for secondary screening based on the inclusion criteria. The final 39 papers judged to satisfy the selection criteria were subject to in-depth analysis and synthesis. The findings of the review reveal that four main techniques have been utilised in efforts to assess creativity in writing, each with their own merits and limitations, and a paucity of research in several crucial areas. The review indicates that, while several disciplines have contributed to the knowledge base in this area, few interdisciplinary studies exist that draw together multiple techniques and provide clear answers for the research questions used in the study. Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that assessment improves student creativity with regard to writing, and new research in the field would be advanced by addressing explicit definitions of creativity, the practices of writing ‘experts’, and writing considered within its social and cultural context.

With respect to the water-wave horizontal velocity and deviation height from the equilibrium of the water, we construct (A) two branches of the hetero-Bäcklund transformations, from that system to a known constant-coefficient nonlinear dispersive-wave system, (B) two branches of the bilinear forms and (C) two branches of the M-soliton solutions, with M as a positive integer. Results rely upon the oceanic shallow-water coefficients in that system.

AB  - Emotional awareness (EA) is recognized as clinically relevant to the vulnerability to, and maintenance of, psychiatric disorders. However, the neurocomputational processes that underwrite individual variations remain unclear. In this paper, we describe a deep (active) inference model that reproduces the cognitive-emotional processes and self-report behaviors associated with EA. We then present simulations to illustrate (seven) distinct mechanisms that (either alone or in combination) can produce phenomena – such as somatic misattribution, coarse-grained emotion conceptualization, and constrained reflective capacity – characteristic of low EA. Our simulations suggest that the clinical phenotype of impoverished EA can be reproduced by dissociable computational processes. The possibility that different processes are at work in different individuals suggests that they may benefit from distinct clinical interventions. As active inference makes particular predictions about the underlying neurobiology of such aberrant inference, we also discuss how this type of modelling could be used to design neuroimaging tasks to test predictions and identify which processes operate in different individuals – and provide a principled basis for personalized precision medicine.

AB  - Projecting analytical concepts is a difficult, though established process in innovation management. Designers face methodological obstacles, however, when engaging with a future system with rapidly changing factors. First, the system’s users do not yet exist. Second, continuing changes in key factors and their interactions make conceiving of relationships and delivering synthesizable data impossible. The rational core for making projections suffers from a lack of substantiation. Both morphological analysis and the Delphi method are established tools in strategic foresight. We suggest that a morphology-based Delphi method supports the process of projecting future outcomes in innovative, complex projects. In addition, each tool compensates for the other’s theoretical and functional deficits by illustrating transparent, value-based arguments in a modifiable, iterative manner.

Unlike other educational technologies that can be tracked when used, ChatGPT has superior abilities that make it virtually untraceable when used. This creates a dilemma for management educators wanting to utilise the technology whilst staying relevant but also interested in authentic learning. Thus, it is critical for management educators to quickly implement policies regarding ChatGPT and subsequent new generative artificial intelligence because of its ease of use and affordability. This article is conceptual in nature and discusses ChatGPT as a generative form of artificial intelligence that presents challenges for management educators that need to be addressed through appropriate strategies. Thereby contributing to the literature on how technological innovations can be included in curriculum design and management learning practices. Practical and managerial implications are stated that highlight the critical need to re-examine existing education practices as a way of incorporating new technological innovation that can be utilised in a beneficial way.

AB  - Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in generative language models and algorithms, have led to significant impacts across diverse domains. AI capabilities to address prompts are growing beyond human capability but we expect AI to perform well also as a prompt engineer. Additionally, AI can serve as a guardian for ethical, security, and other predefined issues related to generated content. We postulate that enforcing dialogues among AI-as-prompt-engineer, AI-as-prompt-responder, and AI-as-Compliance-Guardian can lead to high-quality and responsible solutions. This paper introduces a novel AI collaboration paradigm emphasizing responsible autonomy, with implications for addressing real-world challenges. The paradigm of responsible AI-AI conversation establishes structured interaction patterns, guaranteeing decision-making autonomy. Key implications include enhanced understanding of AI dialogue flow, compliance with rules and regulations, and decision-making scenarios exemplifying responsible autonomy. Real-world applications envision AI systems autonomously addressing complex challenges. We have made preliminary testing of such a paradigm involving instances of ChatGPT autonomously playing various roles in a set of experimental AI-AI conversations and observed evident added value of such a framework.

AB  - Understanding others accurately is crucial in relationships and learning. Research shows that adults face challenges in empathic accuracy, that is, the ability to read the content of others’ moment-to-moment mental states during interactions. Although young children possess some empathic understanding, the extent of their empathic accuracy is uncharted. Using a new SSP, 106 Chinese children aged 60 to 80 months (M = 70 months) were assessed on their ability to infer the mental states of adults in ongoing parent–child interactions. Replicating and extending extant findings on adults and adolescents, the children’s inferences were found to be, at least computationally on a scale of .00 to 1.00, more often inaccurate than accurate regardless of the gender of the targets or participants (overall accuracy rate = .28). However, both the children and their primary caregivers overestimated the children’s performance. In addition, although the primary caregivers expected girls to outperform boys, no gender difference in empathic accuracy was found when controlling for verbal fluency. Drawing on the findings of this first-ever application of the empathic accuracy paradigm in young children, the implications of empathic accuracy performance and misperceptions about such accuracy are discussed.
