AB  - Sustainability is gaining attention, particularly in the building sector, owing to its significant influence on economy, society and environment. However, most assessment methods/frameworks available for this sector focus solely or dominantly on the environmental dimension of sustainability. Hence, a sustainability assessment framework for buildings that accounts for the interdependencies amongst social, economic and environmental aspects is essential. Further, buildings also undergo several time-induced changes in their characteristics, such as changes in electricity consumption, material properties, surrounding infrastructure and energy mix that can influence their sustainability. Therefore, this paper introduces a system dynamics-based methodological framework for Dynamic Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (D-LCSA) capable of incorporating the dynamic changes in the building characteristics with time and capturing the interactions amongst different sustainability indicators. The usability and utility of the framework is demonstrated using a case study residential project in India. The case study results show that ignoring time-dependant dynamic aspects in sustainability assessment of buildings leads to underestimating the overall sustainability impacts by about 50 per cent and specific environmental impacts by about 12 per cent. Therefore, the study reinforces the need to adopt dynamic thinking through modelling and simulation to predict sustainability performance in the built environment.

AB  - Human ratings of conceptual disorganization, poverty of content, referential cohesion and illogical thinking have been shown to predict psychosis onset in prospective clinical high risk (CHR) cohort studies. The potential value of linguistic biomarkers has been significantly magnified, however, by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Such methodologies allow for the rapid and objective measurement of language features, many of which are not easily recognized by human raters. Here we review the key findings on language production disturbance in psychosis. We also describe recent advances in the computational methods used to analyze language data, including methods for the automatic measurement of discourse coherence, syntactic complexity, poverty of content, referential coherence, and metaphorical language. Linguistic biomarkers of psychosis risk are now undergoing cross-validation, with attention to harmonization of methods. Future directions in extended CHR networks include studies of sources of variance, and combination with other promising biomarkers of psychosis risk, such as cognitive and sensory processing impairments likely to be related to language. Implications for the broader study of social communication, including reciprocal prosody, face expression and gesture, are discussed.

AB  - Atrial Flutter (AFL) termination by ablating the path responsible for the arrhythmia maintenance is an extended practice. However, the difficulty associated with the identification of the circuit in the case of atypical AFL motivates the development of diagnostic techniques. We propose body surface phase map analysis as a noninvasive tool to identify AFL circuits. Sixty seven lead body surface recordings were acquired in 9 patients during AFL (i.e. 3 typical, 6 atypical). Computed body surface phase maps from simulations of 5 reentrant behaviors in a realistic atrial structure were also used. Surface representation of the macro-reentrant activity was analyzed by tracking the singularity points (SPs) in surface phase maps obtained from band-pass filtered body surface potential maps. Spatial distribution of SPs showed significant differences between typical and atypical AFL. Whereas for typical AFL patients 70.78 ± 16.17% of the maps presented two SPs simultaneously in the areas defined around the midaxialliary lines, this condition was only satisfied in 5.15 ± 10.99% (p < 0.05) maps corresponding to atypical AFL patients. Simulations confirmed these results. Surface phase maps highlights the reentrant mechanism maintaining the arrhythmia and appear as a promising tool for the noninvasive characterization of the circuit maintaining AFL. The potential of the technique as a diagnosis tool needs to be evaluated in larger populations and, if it is confirmed, may help in planning ablation procedures.

AB  - A teaching approach of programming experiment courses with a new education process is proposed in this study to improve the sustainability of engineering education and extend the accessibility of lab experiments across experiment courses, with the goal of encouraging innovative and scientific thinking among students. The Millikan Oil-Drop experiment combined with Java object-oriented programming is demonstrated as a case study to validate the feasibility and advantages of this teaching approach. The new education process of the experiment course is designed based on Jean Piaget's cognitive development theory, which has high practical potential for popularization among tertiary institutions without additional cost. Additionally, this work discussed the relevance of the general criterion of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology on student outcomes to educational accreditation, further indicating that introducing programming into experiment education can improve students' all-round ability and strengthen the triangular relationship among the three main subjects in tertiary education, namely, students, faculty, and higher educational institutions. This study may serve as an educational guide for teachers and tertiary institutions to pursue innovative and sustainable education.

AB  - The emergence of nontrivial embedded sensor units and cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things has made possible the design and implementation of sophisticated applications where large amounts of real-time data are collected, possibly to constitute a big data picture as time passes. Within this framework, intelligence mechanisms based on machine learning, neural networks, and brain computing approaches play a key role to provide systems with advanced functionalities. Intelligent mechanisms are needed to guarantee appropriate performances within an evolving, time-variant environment, optimally harvest the available energy and manage the residual energy, reduce the energy consumption of the whole system, identify and mitigate occurrence of faults, and provide shields against cyberattacks. The chapter introduces the above aspects of intelligence, whose functionalities are needed to boost the next generation of cyber-physical and Internet of Things applications, and the smart world generation whose footprint is already around us.

AB  - While the burden of disease from well-studied drinking water contaminants is declining, risks from emerging chemical and microbial contaminants arise because of social, technological, demographic and climatological developments. At present, emerging chemical and microbial drinking water contaminants are not assessed in a systematic way, but reactively and incidence based. Furthermore, they are assessed separately despite similar pollution sources. As a result, risks might be addressed ineffectively. Integrated risk assessment approaches are thus needed that elucidate the uncertainties in the risk evaluation of emerging drinking water contaminants, while considering risk assessors’ values. This study therefore aimed to (1) construct an assessment hierarchy for the integrated evaluation of the potential risks from emerging chemical and microbial contaminants in drinking water and (2) develop a decision support tool, based on the agreed assessment hierarchy, to quantify (uncertain) risk scores. A multi-actor approach was used to construct the assessment hierarchy, involving chemical and microbial risk assessors, drinking water experts and members of responsible authorities. The concept of value-focused thinking was applied to guide the problem-structuring and model-building process. The development of the decision support tool was done using Decisi-o-rama, an open-source Python library. With the developed decision support tool (uncertain) risk scores can be calculated for emerging chemical and microbial drinking water contaminants, which can be used for the evidence-based prioritisation of actions on emerging chemical and microbial drinking water risks. The decision support tool improves existing prioritisation approaches as it combines uncertain indicator levels with a multi-stakeholder approach and integrated the risk assessment of chemical and microbial contaminants. By applying the concept of value-focused thinking, this study addressed difficulties in evidence-based decision-making related to emerging drinking water contaminants. Suggestions to improve the model were made to guide future research in assisting policy makers to effectively protect public health from emerging drinking water risks.

We found that more experienced crowdfunders react positively to descriptions exhibiting higher analytical thinking, while less experienced crowdfunders rely more on cues that arouse attention (e.g., number of pictures and positive emotions in videos). We highlight the importance of considering how experience influences crowdfunders’ interpretation of different types of information.

AB  - Experimental and theoretical research aimed at determining the structure and function of the family of intermediate filament proteins has made significant advances over the past 20 years. Much of this has either contributed to or relied on the amino acid sequence databases that are now available online, and the data mining approaches that have been developed to analyze these sequences. As the quality of sequence data is generally high, it follows that it is the design of the computational and graphical methodologies that are of especial importance to researchers who aspire to gain a greater understanding of those sequence features that specify both function and structural hierarchy. However, these techniques are necessarily subject to limitations and it is important that these be recognized. In addition, no single method is likely to be successful in solving a particular problem, and a coordinated approach using a suite of methods is generally required. A final step in the process involves the interpretation of the results obtained and the construction of a working model or hypothesis that suggests further experimentation. While such methods allow meaningful progress to be made it is still important that the data are interpreted correctly and conservatively. New data mining methods are continually being developed, and it can be expected that even greater understanding of the relationship between structure and function will be gleaned from sequence data in the coming years.

AB  - This study is aimed at investigating the contribution of the general intelligence factor if six PISA domains (reading, mathematical, scientific, financial literacies, global competence, and creative thinking) are combined in one measurement instrument. For achieving our goal, items based on the PISA frameworks are developed, students in grades 5–8 from three different Russian regions are assessed, and three IRT models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) are applied to process the data. In addition, the correlations from the multidimensional model are estimated to examine the degree of cognitive specificity and mixture modeling is implemented to investigate ability differentiation across grades. Statistical analysis reveals that the bifactor model comprising one general and six specific factors, has a better fit in each grade. Based on this model, we compute the variance explained by the general factor, with the estimates varying between 60% and 70%. In general, the pure variance explained by specific factors does not exceed 10%. The correlations are above 0.40 in each grade and the averaged associations tend to increase from 6th to 8th grade, although they are smaller in years 6 and 7 compared to year 5. The general ability differentiation effect is observed in grades 6 to 8 and is not present in grade 5. Specific ability differentiation is more pronounced in reading literacy, especially in grade 5 to 7. The results obtained are discussed from the perspective of the ability and developmental differentiation/dedifferentiation problem.

AB  - The brain is first and foremost a control system that is capable of building an internal representation of the external world, and using this representation to make decisions, set goals and priorities, formulate plans, and control behavior with intent to achieve its goals. The internal representation is distributed throughout the brain in two forms: (1) firmware embedded in synaptic connections and axon-dendrite circuitry, and (2) dynamic state-variables encoded in the firing rates of neurons in computational loops in the spinal cord, midbrain, subcortical nuclei, and arrays of cortical columns. It assumes that clusters and arrays of neurons are capable of computing logical predicates, smooth arithmetic functions, and matrix transformations over a space defined by large input vectors and arrays. Feedback from output to input of these neural computational units enable them to function as finite-state-automata (fsa), Markov decision processes (MDP), or delay lines in processing signals and generating strings and grammars. Thus, clusters of neurons are capable of parsing and generating language, decomposing tasks, generating plans, and executing scripts. In the cortex, neurons are arranged in arrays of cortical columns that interact in tight loops with their underlying subcortical nuclei. It is hypothesized that these circuits compute sophisticated mathematical and logical functions that maintain and use complex abstract data structures. It is proposed that cortical hypercolumns together with their underlying thalamic nuclei can be modeled as a cortical computational unit (CCU) consisting of a frame-like data structure (containing attributes and pointers) plus the computational processes and mechanisms required to maintain it and use it for perception cognition, and sensory-motor behavior. In sensory processing areas of the brain, CCU processes enable focus of attention, segmentation, grouping, and classification. Pointers stored in CCU frames define relationships that link pixels and signals to objects and events in situations and episodes. CCU frame pointers also link objects and events to class prototypes and overlay them with meaning and emotional values. In behavior generating areas of the brain, CCU processes make decisions, set goals and priorities, generate plans, and control behavior. In general, CCU pointers are used to define rules, grammars, procedures, plans, and behaviors. CCU pointers also define abstract data structures analogous to lists, frames, objects, classes, rules, plans, and semantic nets. It is suggested that it may be possible to reverse engineer the human brain at the CCU level of fidelity using next-generation massively parallel computer hardware and software.

AB  - Creative thought relies on the reorganisation of existing knowledge. Sleep is known to be important for creative thinking, but there is a debate about which sleep stage is most relevant, and why. We address this issue by proposing that rapid eye movement sleep, or ‘REM’, and non-REM sleep facilitate creativity in different ways. Memory replay mechanisms in non-REM can abstract rules from corpuses of learned information, while replay in REM may promote novel associations. We propose that the iterative interleaving of REM and non-REM across a night boosts the formation of complex knowledge frameworks, and allows these frameworks to be restructured, thus facilitating creative thought. We outline a hypothetical computational model which will allow explicit testing of these hypotheses.

AB  - We organize image types by their substantive relationship with textual claims and discuss their impact on attention, comprehension, memory, and judgment. Photos do not need to be false (altered or generated) to mislead; real photos can create a slanted representation or be repurposed from different events. Even semantically related non-probative photos, merely inserted to attract eyeballs, can increase message acceptance through increased fluency. Messages with images receive more attention and reach a wider audience. Text-congruent images can scaffold the comprehension of true and false claims and support the formation of correct and false memories. Standard laboratory procedures may underestimate the impact of images in natural media contexts: by drawing all participants' attention to a message that may be ignored without an image, they inflate message effects in the control condition. Misleading images are difficult to identify and their influence often remains outside of awareness, making it hard to curb their influence through critical-thinking interventions. Current concerns about deep fakes may reduce trust in all images, potentially limiting their power to mislead as well as inform. More research is needed to understand how knowing that an image is misleading influences inferences, impressions, and judgments beyond immediate assessments of the image's credibility.

The paper concludes by noting the plurality of present-day study, arguably enabled by design thinking, and sketches what this holds for the future of the discipline. The references in the paper are mainly restricted to those published in, or strongly relating to, Design Studies.

AB  - Physics, Neuroscience and Computation are concerned with finding the most appropriate representation spaces to describe the interaction of a dynamic system with its environment. In this work first we review the two basic conceptual approaches to the problem of representing an environment, Marr's ascending “constructivism” and Gibson's “direct perception” hypothesis. Later we review the basic neural mechanisms associated with creating meaning in both approaches: lateral inhibition and the creation of cortical maps by resonance to patterns of stimuli of families of spatially ordered neurons. We end by considering the usefulness in artificial intelligence of knowledge about the way in which biological systems construct their representation spaces. We stress the idea regarding events as representation entities and, consequently, using an event time, different from physical time. Semantics emerges from the mechanisms that detect these relevant events in each organisational level and their composition rules to specify the constitutive entities of the next level. This semantic is distributed in the cortical maps of the neuron groups that resound to the corresponding events.

It would be fun to have a computer that could solve brain teasers as well as the average scientist, but focusing on such things, besides being parochial, overlooks the crucial role language plays in everything humans do, a role we understand hardly at all on a computational level. I am optimistic that we will eventually figure language out, but not without new ideas. Plus, when we can talk to machines, will we understand each other?

Across Asian countries, there is a paucity of literature that explores graduating nursing students' competency and professional competence during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Descriptive, cross-sectional, and predictive approaches.
Method
Convenience sampling was used among graduating nursing students from the six Asian countries (n = 375). The STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies were used. Two self-report instruments were utilized to collect data. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to assess the predictors of nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Results
Country of residence and general point average (GPA) showed statistically significant multivariate effects. Value-based nursing care and critical thinking and reasoning domains recorded the highest in professional competence and competency inventory for nursing students, respectively. Country of residence, GPA, and preferred nursing major were significant predictors of graduating nursing students' nursing competency and professional competence domains.
Conclusion
Our study's findings revealed a high level of diversity among nursing students regarding ethical care obligations, caring pedagogies, and lifelong learning, all of which may be ascribed to their distinct culture, background, and belief systems.

AB  - Integrating renewables into existing energy infrastructure to construct hybrid energy systems (HES) plays a vital role for advancing energy sustainability. While various approaches, such as energy systems analysis and linear or non-linear optimisation, have been employed to achieve energy sustainability mainly at the national or city level, there has been a lack of focus on achieving energy sustainability in the residential sector through a holistic optimal decision-making approach for efficient HES design. This study focuses on developing a multi-stage optimisation-based decision-making framework that models, quantifies, and optimises the performance indicators of HES, allowing for an assessment of the trade-off between benefits and systems costs under various design scenarios. The initial step involves designing the HES model and constructing scenarios that cater to the electrification requirements of water, energy, and food elements in the residential sector by using a systematic thinking approach. Then, a preliminary evaluation of the modelled scenarios is conducted to assess energy sustainability in terms of technical and economic aspects. Afterwards, an optimal decision-making setup is established by integrating a multi-objective HES model into the NSGA-II algorithm, which approximates the Pareto optimal solutions. These solutions are then ranked by using a multi-criteria decision-making method. According to the findings, the Quetta region in Pakistan contains the best optimal solution. The results underscore the utility of the developed framework in facilitating the optimal design of renewables-integrated HES for the residential sector. Furthermore, intergovernmental organizations can leverage this framework to formulate effective policies aimed at encouraging residents to invest in HES installation.

KW  - Consciousness
AB  - We consider a class of Kuramoto models, with an array of N individual k-dimensional clocks (k>1), coupled within a directed, range dependent, network. For each directed connection, a signal triggered at the sending clock incurs a (real valued) time delay before arriving at the receiving clock, where it induces an instantaneous phase reset affecting all k-phases. Instantaneous phase resetting maps (PRMs) for k-dimensional clocks have received little attention. The system may be treated as open and subject to periodic, or other types of, PRM forcing at any individual clock, as a result of external forcing stimuli. We show how the full system, with Nk phase variables, responds to such stimuli, as the impact spreads across the entire network. Beyond simulations, we employ methods to reverse engineer the dynamical behaviour of the whole: estimating the intrinsic dimensions of the responses to different experiments; and by analysing pairwise comparisons between those responses. This shows that the system’s responses are governed by a hierarchy of internal dynamical modes, existing across both the Nk phases and over time. We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each k-dimensional clock models the dynamics of a single neural column, which contains 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons. The Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. An array of N=1M such columns/clocks is at the 10B neuron scale of the human cortex. However its simulation is far more accessible than very large scale (VLS) simulations of neuron-to-neuron systems on supercomputers. The latent modes may have important implications for cognition (information processing) and for consciousness (the existence of internal phenomenological experiences). We argue that the existence of the latter plays a key role in preconditioning the former, reducing the decision sets and the cognitive load, and thus enabling a fast-thinking evolutionary advantage. This is the first time that systems of k-dimensional clocks (k> 1), coupled via time-lagged PRMs, within range dependent networks, have been deployed to demonstrate the basic internal phenomenological elements (of consciousness) and their potential role within immediate cognition. Statement of Significance: We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each of 1M k-dimensional clocks models the dynamics of a single neural column (containing 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons). This Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. Large scale human cortex simulations, with 10B neutrons, usually require a super computer. We show that similar results, using this model, can be obtained on a laptop. In particular we show that such dynamical can support internal phenomenological elements (of conscious experience) and we discuss their potential role in preconditioning immediate cognition, furnishing a “fast thinking” evolutionary advantage to the human brain.

AB  - Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and managing urban water systems (UWS), with mechanistic models often serving as the foundation for their design and operations. Despite the wide adoptions, mechanistic models are challenged by the complexity of dynamic processes and high computational demands. Data-driven models bring opportunities to capture system complexities and reduce computational cost, by leveraging the abundant data made available by recent advance in sensor technologies. However, the interpretability and data availability hinder their wider adoption. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in the application of data-driven models within the context of UWS. Integrating existing mechanistic knowledge into data-driven modeling offers a unique solution that reduces data requirements and enhances model interpretability. The knowledge-informed approach balances model complexity with dataset size, enabling more efficient and interpretable modeling in UWS. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic and data-driven models offers a more accurate representation of UWS dynamics, addressing lingering uncertainties and advancing modelling capabilities. This paper presents perspectives and conceptual framework on developing and implementing knowledge-informed data-driven modeling, highlighting their potential to improve UWS management in the digital era.

AB  - There is a growing body of road safety research that seeks to identify crash contributory factors beyond road users, their vehicles, and the immediate road environment. Although cyclist safety represents a critical research area, this ‘systems thinking’ approach has received less attention in bicycle crash analysis. This article presents the findings from a systematic literature review which aimed to synthesise the peer reviewed literature regarding bicycle crash contributory factors (defined as factors which play a contributory role in bicycle crashes, as opposed to risk factors which are factors which may increase the probability of crashes). Crash contributory factors were extracted from included articles and mapped onto a systems thinking framework comprising seven hierarchical road transport system levels. The findings show that a majority of the included studies identified contributory factors relating to the road environment, cycling infrastructure, and cyclist and driver behaviour. No studies identified contributory factors outside of cyclists and road users, bicycles and vehicles, and the road environment and few specifically examined causal relationships between contributory factors. It is concluded that there are gaps in the knowledge base regarding the broader transport system features that play a role in bicycle crashes and how contributory factors interact to create crashes. We argue that more expansive research into the systemic factors involved in bicycle crashes is required and that initial work should focus on the development of new data sources and analysis methods.

AB  - I incorporate the level-k thinking solution concept into a simplified (Brummermeier and Pedersen, 2005) predatory trading model to investigate the possibility of arbitraging arbitrageurs. While naive financial predators prey upon a single distressed investor, higher-level thinkers best respond to this and prey upon fellow predators. For some parameter values, sophisticated predators are able to reason their way to the Nash equilibrium strategy, and prices do not oscillate. As parameter values are perturbed, the system undergoes a bifurcation and predators select strategies from a mean-preserving spread of the Nash equilibrium strategy. In these settings, prices display excess volatility and a single shock can send predators into an oscillatory trading frenzy.

The human–machine integrated automating design paradigm is reviewed systematically based on a proposed prototype of human–machine integrated design, from the aspects of ontology-based knowledge management with local-to-global ontology transitions, and epistemology-based upward-spiral cognitive process of coupled design ideation. Particularly, imaginal thinking frame is proposed as the foundation of intelligent human–machine interaction that puts human and machine on an equal platform. Further, this paper presents implementations and applications of the automating design paradigm and concludes with the identification of future trend.

AB  - Human creativity generates novel ideas to solve real-world problems. This thereby grants us the power to transform the surrounding world and extend our human attributes beyond what is currently possible. Creative ideas are not just new and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are useful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available resources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is poorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of generated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design problem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic measures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic similarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict the success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances information content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative problem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying real-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success of produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem solving, student training and skill acquisition. A selected subset of information content (IC Sánchez–Batet) and semantic similarity (Lin/Sánchez–Batet) measures, which are both statistically powerful and computationally fast, could support the development of technologies for computer-assisted enhancements of human creativity or for the implementation of creativity in machines endowed with general artificial intelligence.

AB  - Technological advances and high-throughput bio-chemical assays are rapidly changing ways how we formulate and test biological hypotheses, and how we treat patients. Most complex diseases arise on a background of genetics, lifestyle and environment factors, and manifest themselves as a spectrum of symptoms. To fathom intricate biological processes and their changes from healthy to disease states, we need to systematically integrate and analyze multi-omics datasets, ontologies, and diverse annotations. Without proper management of such complex biological and clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms alone cannot be effectively trained, validated, and successfully applied to provide trustworthy and patient-centric diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Precision medicine requires to use multi-omics approaches effectively, and offers many opportunities for using AI, “big data” analytics, and integrative computational biology workflows. Advances in optical and biochemical assay technologies including sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging modalities have transformed research by empowering us to simultaneously view all genes expressed, identify proteome-wide changes, and assess interacting partners of each individual protein within a dynamically changing biological system, at an individual cell level. While such views are already having an impact on our understanding of healthy and disease conditions, it remains challenging to extract useful information comprehensively and systematically from individual studies, ensure that signal is separated from noise, develop models, and provide hypotheses for further research. Data remain incomplete and are often poorly connected using fragmented biological networks. In addition, statistical and machine learning models are developed at a cohort level and often not validated at the individual patient level. Combining integrative computational biology and AI has the potential to improve understanding and treatment of diseases by identifying biomarkers and building explainable models characterizing individual patients. From systematic data analysis to more specific diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, drug mechanism of action, and patient selection, such analyses influence multiple steps from prevention to disease characterization, and from prognosis to drug discovery. Data mining, machine learning, graph theory and advanced visualization may help identify diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and create causal models of disease. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments leads to faster, more biologically and clinically relevant discoveries. However, computational analysis results and models are going to be only as accurate and useful as correct and comprehensive are the networks, ontologies and datasets used to build them. High quality, curated data portals provide the necessary foundation for translational research. They help to identify better biomarkers, new drugs, precision treatments, and should lead to improved patient outcomes and their quality of life. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments, efficiently and effectively leads to more useful findings faster.

AB  - Neuroscientists often describe neural activity as a representation of something, or claim to have found evidence for a neural representation, but there is considerable ambiguity about what such claims entail. Here we develop a thorough account of what ‘representation’ does and should do for neuroscientists in terms of three key aspects of representation. (i) Correlation: a neural representation correlates to its represented content; (ii) causal role: the representation has a characteristic effect on behavior; and (iii) teleology: a goal or purpose served by the behavior and thus the representation. We draw broadly on literature in both neuroscience and philosophy to show how these three aspects are rooted in common approaches to understanding the brain and mind. We first describe different contexts that ‘representation’ has been closely linked to in neuroscience, then discuss each of the three aspects in detail.

We use three Kuramoto oscillators to model a continuum of responses, and we provide detailed numerical simulations and analysis of the three-oscillator Kuramoto problem, including an analysis of the stability points for different coupling conditions. We show that the oscillator simulation data are well-matched to the behavioral data of the three experiments.

AB  - Examination of numerical cognition encompasses multiple facets (eg, discrete vs. continuous properties, subitizing, estimation, counting, etc.). Many models have been suggested to explain these features. By looking into the basic ability to perceive size, against the complex one of counting, we hypothesize that counting system evolved on the basis of a primitive size perception system rather than the two systems evolved separately. In this chapter, we present a novel way of using evolutionary computation techniques to evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs) first to perceive size and then to count, and compare their counting skills to a different group of ANNs who evolved to count from scratch. The results revealed better counting skills when evolving first to perceive size (or other classification task) and then to count over those who evolved just to count. In addition, ANNs who evolved with continuous stimuli presented better counting skills than those evolved with discrete stimuli.

AB  - This paper studies a group of basic state reduction based dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for the multi-objective 0–1 knapsack problem (MKP), which are related to the backward reduced-state DP space (BRDS) and forward reduced-state DP space (FRDS). The BRDS is widely ignored in the literature because it imposes disadvantage for the single objective knapsack problem (KP) in terms of memory requirements. The FRDS based DP algorithm in a general sense is related to state dominance checking, which can be time consuming for the MKP while it can be done efficiently for the KP. Consequently, no algorithm purely based on the FRDS with state dominance checking has ever been developed for the MKP. In this paper, we attempt to get some insights into the state reduction techniques efficient to the MKP. We first propose an FRDS based algorithm with a local state dominance checking for the MKP. Then we evaluate the relative advantage of the BRDS and FRDS based algorithms by analyzing their computational time and memory requirements for the MKP. Finally different combinations of the BRDS and FRDS based algorithms are developed on this basis. Numerical experiments based on the bi-objective KP instances are conducted to compare systematically between these algorithms and the recently developed BRDS based DP algorithm as well as the existing FRDS based DP algorithm without state dominance checking.

The TNM system of staging cancers is a simple and effective method to map the extent of tumours. It had traditionally strived to maintain a balance between being simple and user-friendly on one hand and comprehensive on the other. A number of revisions have taken place over the years with the goal of improving utility. However, numerous controversies surround the TNM system. There is a school of thought that contends that patient co-morbidity and specific tumour-related factors should be incorporated to add further prognostic capabilities in the TNM system, but this raises concerns that such an approach may unnecessarily complicate the system. This review highlights some controversies that surround the TNM system and suggests prognostic indicators that may be added to make it more useful in guiding treatment decisions and predicting outcomes.

AB  - This chapter revisits the concept of disasters as failures introduced in Chapter 2. This entails approaches to consider the many factors and causes. System thinking is introduced as a means of preventing or reducing the damage of disasters. Systematic approaches must make use of various tools, including regulatory measures; economic incentives; property rights; infrastructure installment; public education; for international projects, international inspections; and cooperation. Disaster prevention and mitigation must integrate planning and engineering approaches, especially thoughtful land use. This also requires an understanding of how people expect to meet basic and advanced needs, as exemplified by Maslow's hierarchy. Other tools include optimizing information technologies and interoperability. The good news is that with education and consideration of past disasters, the implementation of rules and regulations there can be a reduction of number and severity of disasters; e.g., decrease in oil tanker spills over the past half century.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that altered states of consciousness (ASC) are associated with both positive and negative effects on components of creative performance, and convergent and divergent thinking in particular. We provide a metacontrol framework that allows characterizing factors that induce ASC in terms of their general impact on the information processing style of problem solvers. We discuss behavioral and neuronal findings from three areas that reflect strong connections between ASC and the underlying effects on metacontrol on the one hand and components of creativity on the other hand: drug-induced ASC, meditation-induced ASC, and hallucinations. While more, and especially more systematic research is needed, we identify a general trend, suggesting that factors that induce ASC are likely to alter the metacontrol state by biasing it toward either persistence, which is beneficial for convergent thinking and other persistence-heavy operations, or flexibility, which is beneficial for divergent thinking and other flexibility-heavy operations.

AB  - Proponents of artificial intelligence boast its many promises, including the potential for creativity. Whether the realities of artificial cognition align with these promises, however, remains hotly debated. In this chapter, we explore the role of artificial intelligence in creative problem-solving through the lens of cognition. Through this lens, we advance the argument that, at present, creative problem-solving remains a distinctly human capability. Specifically, we examine how artificial cognition can and cannot engage in each stage of creative problem-solving, as well as the underlying mechanisms of divergent and convergent thinking. Although we find little evidence to support the creativity of artificial cognition, we advance several ways in which artificial cognition can augment human cognition to enhance creative problem-solving.

AB  - RNA molecules are important cellular components involved in many fundamental biological processes. Understanding the mechanisms behind their functions requires RNA tertiary structure knowledge. Although modeling approaches for the study of RNA structures and dynamics lag behind efforts in protein folding, much progress has been achieved in the past two years. Here, we review recent advances in RNA folding algorithms, RNA tertiary motif discovery, applications of graph theory approaches to RNA structure and function, and in silico generation of RNA sequence pools for aptamer design. Advances within each area can be combined to impact many problems in RNA structure and function.

AB  - This research explores how deductive engineering thinking, as opposed to an abductive design rationale, can influence how robotic methods of fabricating building components are developed. The goal of this research is to demonstrate how creative thinking can introduce alternative robotic fabrication techniques targeted for the architectural mass-customization process. For this purpose, we chose robotic dieless sheet metal folding as the main fabrication technique, due to its wide range of applications in both the architectural construction and manufacturing industries. Two robotic sheet metal folding projects were developed. The first, an example of tool programming, took advantage of an engineering approach and was focused on the affordances of the tool (an industrial robotic arm). The second project, one of material programming, employed a design methodology and was directed towards the affordances of the material (i.e., stainless steel sheet metal). By discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, this research argues that both engineering and design should be considered required and complementary processes in the development of new creative fabrication solutions, allowing them to and make the overall production process more efficient.

AB  - This study examined conceptions of algebra held by 30 preservice elementary teachers. In addition to exploring participants’ general “definitions” of algebra, this study examined, in particular, their analyses of tasks designed to engage students in relational thinking or a deep understanding of the equal sign as well as student work on these tasks. Findings from this study suggest that preservice elementary teachers’ conceptions of algebra as subject matter are rather narrow. Most preservice teachers equated algebra with the manipulation of symbols. Very few identified other forms of reasoning – in particular, relational thinking – with the algebra label. Several participants made comments implying that student strategies that demonstrate traditional symbol manipulation might be valued more than those that demonstrate relational thinking, suggesting that what is viewed as algebra is what will be valued in the classroom. This possibility, along with implications for mathematics teacher education, will be discussed.

AB  - A cell interacts with its environment through adhesion complexes. These are protein complexes that form through noncovalent interactions between adhesion receptors in the cell membrane and similar receptors in neighboring cells or ligand molecules in the surrounding extracellular matrix. Cell adhesions are crucial to maintain tissue integrity and cellular communication. Communication and sensing occur through the transmittal of forces through adhesions. This relevant role motivated researchers to develop theoretical models of adhesion. Initial models were based on studies of association kinetics of proteins, which later were expanded to explicitly include the role of force in determining bond strength. The introduction of techniques that allowed measurements of force in the range of a single adhesion produced models that describe the inner workings of the adhesion molecules themselves. Despite the relative simplicity of these models, they are still relevant. Not only were these studies novel and creative, they have been integrated into models describing larger cellular aggregates, unraveling the role of mechanics in biology. These models have been used in the study of cell migration, developmental biology, and cancer biology.

AB  - In cheap talk games, equilibrium analysis predicts extreme limits on the information that can be transmitted when senders and receivers have different goals. Yet experimental evidence suggests that senders overcommunicate relative to this baseline, revealing more information than predicted in equilibrium. We propose that overcommunication may be due in part to limited cognitive engagement by subjects, captured by level-k thinking. To test this conjecture, we compare two elicitation methods, direct response and the strategy method, holding other elements of the game fixed. Existing experimental studies of cheap talk games use the standard direct response method, while the strategy method—in which subjects make selections for all contingent choices—is believed to encourage more thoughtful decisionmaking. We therefore expect senders to transmit less information with the strategy method than with direct response. In contrast, we find the reverse: the strategy method increased overcommunication. Further examination suggests that this occurred because senders played more naïvely with the strategy method than with direct response. Our findings suggest that the strategy method and direct response do not elicit the same choices in cheap talk games.

AB  - Divergent thinking (DT) ability (i.e., the ability to come up with creative ideas) is a complex cognitive construct that has been associated with several specific components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model. In this study, we employed a nested latent variable approach to examine the specific role of mental speed (Gs) and general retrieval ability (Gr) in DT ability, which was assessed by DT tasks that instructed to be creative and were scored for creative quality. Specifically, Gs was assumed to facilitate both Gr and DT, and Gr was assumed to contribute to DT. Successive latent variable models with orthogonal factors were tested to reflect these nested cognitive basic abilities. The proposed model of nested factors fit the data well: Latent Gs accounted for variation in Gs, Gr, and DT creative quality scores, latent Gr predicted performance in Gr and DT scores beyond Gs, and latent DT explained variation in DT scores beyond Gs and Gr. In addition, we related the resulting orthogonal latent variables to the external criteria of school grades to illustrate the explanatory power of the modeling approach. This study provides evidence that divergent thinking performance relies on mental speed and retrieval ability, as well as cognitive abilities unique to divergent thinking. We discuss consequences for the understanding of divergent thinking ability in the context of the CHC model.

AB  - Due to the widespread use of the internet, computer network systems may be exposed to different types of attacks. For this reason, the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often used to protect the network systems. Network traffic data (i.e., network packets) includes many features. However, most of them are irrelevant and can lead to a decrease in the runtime and/or the detection performance of the IDS. Although various data mining methods have been applied to improve the effectiveness of IDS, research regarding IDSs having high detection rates and better runtime performance (i.e., lower computational cost) is ongoing. On the other hand, the dimensionality reduction techniques help to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce the computation time of a classification algorithm. In the literature, the feature selection methods (i.e., filter and wrapper) have been widely used for the dimensionality reduction in IDSs. Although the wrapper feature selection techniques outperform the filters, they are time-consuming. Again, the ensemble classifiers can achieve higher detection rates for IDSs compared to the stand-alone classifiers, but they require more computation time to build the model. In order to improve the runtime performance and the detection rate of IDS, a swift wrapper feature selection and a speedy ensemble classifier are proposed in this study. For the dimensionality reduction, the swift wrapper feature selection (i.e., DBDE-QDA) is used, which consists of dichotomous binary differential evolution (DBDE) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). For attack detection, the speedy ensemble classifier is used, which combines Holte's 1R, random tree, and reduced error pruning tree. In the experiments, the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets are used. According to the experimental results, the proposed IDS reaches 95%–97.4%, 82.7%, and 99.5%–99.9% detection rates for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets. In this way, the proposed IDS competes with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate. In addition, the proposed IDS has a lower computational cost than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DBDE-QDA reduces the dimension by 60.97%–82.92%, 73.46%, and 96.55%–98.85% for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDoS2019 datasets.

AB  - This report describes a computational method developed to predict systemic exposure (s-exposure), chemical disposition {(CD) intestinal absorption, transport, membrane permeability, distribution, sequestration, phospholipidosis and toxicokinetics} of organic chemicals in humans. The method qualitatively and quantitatively estimates a chemical's CD activity profile based upon computed molecular descriptor properties (descriptors), and it facilitates in silico signal-detection of data-gaps, prioritization, risk-ranking, read-across, and re-assessments (if mandated) of large sets of chemicals in a safety evaluation setting. The investigation used a reference set of 2372 marketed human pharmaceuticals to define decision rules for an optimal chemical space (OCS) in which chemicals have high s-exposure, good CD, and a potential for chemical toxicity (CT); conversely, chemicals outside the OCS have low s-exposure, poor CD into the body, and low potential for CT. The method requires computation of 29 descriptors, identification of OCS molecular descriptor property violations (descriptor_violations), and alignment of descriptor_violations with specific decision rules for individual CD endpoint activities. The investigation predicted the CD activities of food and cosmetic preservatives, ingredients in GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Notices submitted to the FDA, reference pharmaceuticals, and it provides prioritization metrics and indices that facilitate prioritization of chemical in silico computed CD activities.

AB  - CONTEXT
Big data applications in agriculture evolve fast, as more experience, applications, good practices and computational power become available. Actual solutions to real-life problems are scarce. What characterizes the adoption of big data problems to solutions and to what extent is there a match between them?
OBJECTIVE
We aim to assess the conditions of the adoption of big data technologies in agricultural applications, based on the investigation of twelve real-life practical use cases in the precision agriculture and livestock domain.
METHODS
We use a mixed method approach: a case study research around the twelve use cases of Horizon 2020 project CYBELE, varying from precision arable and livestock farming to fishing and food security, and a stakeholder survey (n = 56). Our analysis focuses on four perspectives: (1) the drivers of change that initiated the use cases; (2) the big data characteristics of the problem; (3) the technological maturity level of the solution both at start and end of the project; (4) the stakeholder perspective.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Results show that the use cases’ drivers of change are a combination of data-, technology, research- and commercial interests; most have at least a research drive. The big data characteristics (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) are well-represented, with most emphasis on velocity and variety. Technology readiness levels show that the majority of use cases started at experimental or lab environment stage and aims at a technical maturity of real-world small-scale deployment. Stakeholders’ main concern is cost, user friendliness and to embed the solution within their current work practice. The adoption of better-matching big data solutions is modest. Big data solutions do not work out-of-the-box when changing application domains. Additional technology development is needed for addressing the idiosyncrasies of agricultural applications.
SIGNIFICANCE
We add a practical, empirical assessment of the current status of big data problems and solutions to the existing body of mainly theoretical knowledge. We considered the CYBELE research project as our laboratory for this. Our strength is that we interviewed the use case representatives in person, and that we included the stakeholders’ perspective in our results. Large-scale deployments need effective interdisciplinary approaches and long-term project horizons to address issues emerging from big data characteristics, and to avoid compartmentalization of agricultural sciences. We need both an engineering perspective – to make things work in practice – and a systems thinking perspective – to offer holistic, integrated solutions.

AB  - A stabilized finite element formulation for three-dimensional unsteady incompressible flows is implemented on a distributed memory parallel computer. A matrix-free version of the GMRES algorithm is utilized to solve the equation systems in an implicit manner. The scalability of the computations on a 64-processor Linux cluster is evaluated for moderate to large size problems. A method for estimating the speedup for large-scale problems, where computations on a single processor is not possible, is proposed. Superlinear speedup is observed, perhaps for the first time, for a large-scale problem that is associated with more than 44 million nodes and 176 million equations. The performance of the various subactivities of the program is monitored to investigate the cause. It is found that the formation of the RHS vector and the preconditioner achieves a very high level of superlinear speedup as the number of processors increase. As a result, even though the network time for interprocessor communication increases with increase in processors, an overall superlinear speedup is realized for large-scale problems. The superlinear speedup is attributed to cache related effects. A comparison between the performance of matrix and matrix-free versions of the GMRES algorithm is carried out. It is found that for large-scale applications the matrix-free version outperforms its counterpart for reasonable dimensions of the Kyrylov subspace. The effect of mesh partitioning on the scalability is also studied. A significant reduction in communication time is observed with partitioning that leads to an overall improvement of speedup. The parallel implementation is utilized to study the wake instabilities in flow past a stationary circular cylinder at Re=150, 200 and 300. The Re=150 flow is found to be two-dimensional while mode-A and mode-B instabilities are observed at Re=200 and 300, respectively. The Re=300 flow is associated with a low frequency modulation in addition to the vortex shedding frequency.

AB  - The self-assembly behavior of shape-anisotropic particles at curved fluid interfaces is computationally investigated by diffuse interface field approach (DIFA). A Gibbs–Duhem-type thermodynamic formalism is introduced to treat heterogeneous pressure within the phenomenological model, in agreement with Young–Laplace equation. Computer simulations are performed to study the effects of capillary forces (interfacial tension and Laplace pressure) on particle self-assembly at fluid interfaces in various two-dimensional cases. For isolated particles, it is found that the equilibrium liquid interface remains circular and particles of different shapes do not disturb the homogeneous curvature of liquid interface, while the equilibrium position, orientation and stability of a particle at the liquid interface depend on its shape and initial location with respect to the liquid interface. For interacting particles, the curvature of local liquid interfaces is different from the apparent curvature of the particle shell; nevertheless, irrespective of the particle shapes, a particle-coated droplet always tends to deform into a circular morphology under positive Laplace pressure, loses mechanical stability and collapses under negative Laplace pressure, while adapts to any morphology and stays in neutral equilibrium under zero Laplace pressure. Finally, the collective behaviors of particles and Laplace pressure evolution in bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are investigated.

In ways different from conventional smart city initiatives that surveil urban dynamics en masse to imperceptibly calibrate large-scale urban services and infrastructural systems, the projects discussed in this chapter engage sensor-based technologies to create localized, responsive, and interactive urban environments to address the social, cultural, and aesthetic dimensions of urban livability.

KW  - Computer programming learning
KW  - Blocks-based approach
KW  - Serious games
AB  - Blocks-based environments have been used to promote computational thinking (CT) and programming learning mostly in elementary and middle schools. In many countries, like Brazil and Portugal, isolated initiatives have been launched to promote CT learning, but until now there is no evidence of a widespread use of this type of environments. Consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with CT and programming. This paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. It is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the student’s progress and customize in-game tasks. Four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used. Based on the results of these experiences, the key contribution of this paper is a set of fourteen findings and recommendations to the creation and use of a game-based approach to support introductory computer programming learning for novices.

AB  - Diverse explanations or theories of consciousness are arrayed on a roughly physicalist-to-nonphysicalist landscape of essences and mechanisms. Categories: Materialism Theories (philosophical, neurobiological, electromagnetic field, computational and informational, homeostatic and affective, embodied and enactive, relational, representational, language, phylogenetic evolution); Non-Reductive Physicalism; Quantum Theories; Integrated Information Theory; Panpsychisms; Monisms; Dualisms; Idealisms; Anomalous and Altered States Theories; Challenge Theories. There are many subcategories, especially for Materialism Theories. Each explanation is self-described by its adherents, critique is minimal and only for clarification, and there is no attempt to adjudicate among theories. The implications of consciousness explanations or theories are assessed with respect to four questions: meaning/purpose/value (if any); AI consciousness; virtual immortality; and survival beyond death. A Landscape of Consciousness, I suggest, offers perspective.

AB  - Risk entails every action, every level and every perspective of our lives. The ability to make advantageous decisions, to deal with uncertainties, to infer and estimate more or less probable outcomes, to manage risky or riskless situations compose the wider notion of risk literacy and may be inserted from formal preschool education. The current paper aims to enlighten the notion of risk literacy and safety education as a necessity in establishing pupils ready to accept failure, to achieve success, to take initiatives, to become self-competent, to develop probabilistic and statistical thinking, to confront uncertainty and in turn to face the challenges of modern risk society. It is argued that within the formal settings of preschool education, through developmentally appropriate activities, opportunities may be implemented in order to encourage children as future citizens to construct risk literate personalities. It is concluded that risk perception and management imply awareness, assessment, avoidance and adaptation and are connected with growth, maturity, practice, experiences, intuitions and computations.

AB  - Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technology plays a key role in improving the energy conversion efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems, especially when multiple local maximum power points (LMPPs) occur under partial shading conditions (PSC). It is necessary to modify the operating point efficiently and accurately with the help of MPPT technology to maximize the collected power. Even though a lot of research has been carried out and impressive progress achieved for MPPT technology, it still faces some challenges and dilemmas. Firstly, the mathematical model established for PV cells is not precise enough. Second, the existing algorithms are often optimized for specific conditions and lack comprehensive adaptability to the actual operating environment. Besides, a single algorithm may not be able to give full play to its advantages. In the end, the selection criteria for choosing the suitable MPPT algorithm/converter combination to achieve better performance in a given scenario is very limited. Therefore, this paper systematically discusses the current research status and challenges faced by PV MPPT technology around the three aspects of MPPT models, algorithms, and hardware implementation. Through in-depth thinking and discussion, it also puts forward positive perspectives on future development, and five forward-looking solutions to improve the performance of PV systems MPPT are suggested.

We introduce an energy ecosystem, where contemporary technologies are used and by involving advanced methods of data analysis and optimization, we aim to ensure its effective operation. In order to schedule reliable energy supply, the prediction models for power load consumption and for energy spot prices are inevitable. We provide an overview of forecasting and optimization methods and propose solutions, which deal with stream and online processing as well as adaptivity of the proposed solutions. Several different prediction methods including statistical methods and computational intelligence methods, as well as our proposed ensemble and online SVR method are compared. We take into account the current trends of distributed energy generation from renewable sources and anticipate massive usage of electro vehicles in the near future, where the optimization of the whole environment is needed.

AB  - Because the brain performs Bayesian inference for the causes of its sensory data, the synaptic gain could encode the precision (inverse variance) of its beliefs using a hierarchical generative model and predictive coding. Several neurobiological risk factors for schizophrenia (NMDAR and GABAergic interneuron hypofunction) reduce both synaptic and “oscillatory” gain at high hierarchical areas. This could impair the encoding of precision at higher levels of the brain’s hierarchical model and increase expected precision at lower levels. This imbalance can account for many neurobiological and phenomenological findings in schizophrenia. Striatal D2R hyperactivity may increase the precision of current policies by inhibiting behavioral or cognitive switching. This could be a (dysfunctional) consequence of or even an attempt to compensate for prefrontal or hippocampal pathology. This D2R hyperactivity may also reduce learning from positive outcomes and affect the encoding of motivational (or informational) salience.

AB  - Problem posing is increasingly being considered in the field of education, with many experts exploring its positive effects on student learning outcomes. In this case, different perspectives have emerged regarding the impact of the intervention, claiming the overall effect remains uncertain. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of a problem posing instructional intervention on student learning outcomes at the cognitive and non-cognitive levels from 2000 to 2023, using a three-level meta-analysis. 32 studies and 4,068 participants were included to compare the classrooms with and without problem posing instructional interventions in elementary to higher education. The results showed a moderate-positive and small positive effect on students cognitive (Hedges' g = 0.681, 95 % CI [0.552, 0.810], p < 0.001) and non-cognitive (Hedges' g = 0.367, 95 % CI [0.113, 0.620], p = 0.003) levels, respectively. Based on the moderator analysis, there were differences in the learning outcomes among students across various task formats. Notably, tasks that included specific information and involved problem posing in context demonstrated significantly better performance. In conclusion, these results indicate the importance of problem posing instructional interventions in promoting student's development and their impact on cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions.

AB  - Summary
Widespread changes to climate-sensitive systems are placing increased demands on risk assessments as a foundation for managing risk. Recent attention to compounding and cascading risks, deep uncertainty, and “bottom-up” risk assessment frameworks have foregrounded the need to account for systemic complexity in risk assessment methodology. We describe the sources of systemic complexity and highlight the role of risk assessments as a formal sense-making device that enables learning and organizing knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the climate-sensitive system and its (climatological) environment. We highlight boundary judgments as a core concern of risk assessments, helping to create islands of analytical and cognitive tractability in a complex, uncertain, and ambiguous world. We then point to three key concepts—boundary critique, multi-methodology, and second-order learning—as critical elements of contemporary risk assessment practice, and we weave these into an overarching framework to better account for systemic complexity in the assessment of climate risk.

AB  - Steady state and transient characteristics of a natural circulation loop working with water are obtained. For this purpose, 3D steady state and transient CFD simulations are performed. The CFD model includes pipe thickness as well as secondary side coolant passage apart from primary side. Steady state and transient characteristics are computed for various configurations i.e. Vertical Heater Vertical Cooler (VHVC), Horizontal Heater Horizontal Cooler (HHHC), etc. Steady state data was compared with available correlations. Flow initiation transients were compared with experimental data. Both the steady state and transient results are found to be in good agreement with previously published data. The reason for formation of unidirectional and bi-directional pulsing in HHHC configuration at different powers is explained with the help of temperature fields at different instants of time. Effect of sudden power rise/power step back on instability in HHHC configuration is estimated using CFD simulations.

AB  - E-learning systems output a huge quantity of data on a learning process. However, it takes a lot of specialist human resources to manually process these data and generate an assessment report. Additionally, for formative assessment, the report should state the attainment level of the learning goals defined by the instructor. This paper describes the use of the granular linguistic model of a phenomenon (GLMP) to model the assessment of the learning process and implement the automated generation of an assessment report. GLMP is based on fuzzy logic and the computational theory of perceptions. This technique is useful for implementing complex assessment criteria using inference systems based on linguistic rules. Apart from the grade, the model also generates a detailed natural language progress report on the achieved proficiency level, based exclusively on the objective data gathered from correct and incorrect responses. This is illustrated by applying the model to the assessment of Dijkstra’s algorithm learning using a visual simulation-based graph algorithm learning environment, called GRAPHs.

AB  - Economic dispatch (ED) problem is a nonlinear and non-smooth optimization problem when valve-point effects, multi-fuel effects and prohibited operating zones (POZs) have been considered. This paper presents an efficient evolutionary method for a constrained ED problem using the new adaptive particle swarm optimization (NAPSO) algorithm. The original PSO has difficulties in premature convergence, performance and the diversity loss in optimization process as well as appropriate tuning of its parameters. In the proposed algorithm, to improve the global searching capability and prevent the convergence to local minima, a new mutation is integrated with adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO). In APSO, the inertia weight is tuned by using fuzzy IF/THEN rules and the cognitive and the social parameters are self-adaptively adjusted. The proposed NAPSO algorithm is validated on test systems consisting of 6, 10, 15, 40 and 80 generators with the objective functions possessing prohibited zones, multi-fuel effects and valve-point loading effects. The research results reveal the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm to the practical ED problem.

AB  - Designers often face situations where the only way forward is through the exploration of possibilities. However, there is a critical disconnect between understanding of how designer’s think and act in such situations. We address this disconnect by proposing and testing (via protocol analysis) the cognitive co-evolution model. Our model comprises a new approach to co-evolutionary design theory by explaining both the progression of the process itself and the creation of design outputs via an interplay between metacognitive perceived uncertainty, cognition, and the external world. We thus connect explanations of how designers think with descriptions of how they act. We provide a foundation for connecting to other theories, models, and questions in design research via common links to cognition and metacognition.

AB  - Cholinergic (Ach), Noradrenergic (NE), and Dopaminergic (DA) pathways play an important role in the regulation of spatial attention. The same neurotransmitters are also responsible for inter-individual differences in temperamental traits. Here we explored whether biologically defined temperamental traits determine differences in the ability to orient spatial attention as a function of the probabilistic association between cues and targets. To this aim, we administered the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) to a sample of 151 participants who also performed a Posner task with central endogenous predictive (80 % valid/20 % invalid) or non-predictive cues (50 % valid/50 % invalid). We found that only participants with high scores in Plasticity and Intellectual Endurance showed a selective abatement of attentional costs with non-predictive cues. In addition, stepwise regression showed that costs in the non-predictive condition were negatively predicted by scores in Plasticity and positively predicted by scores in Probabilistic Thinking. These results show that stable temperamental characteristics play an important role in defining the inter-individual differences in attentional behaviour, especially in the presence of different probabilistic organisations of the sensory environment. These findings emphasize the importance of considering temperamental and personality traits in social and professional environments where the ability to control one's attention is a crucial functional skill.

AB  - In this paper we report the work that jeKnowledge (Júnior Empresa da Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologias da Universidade de Coimbra), a student-led initiative, has done in the ‘jeKnowledge academy’ courses to actively engage Portuguese high-school students in STEM education through hands-on projects based on the low-cost Arduino platform. F2F activities, based on a peer-assisted learning strategy, were complemented with tutorials and more advanced project suggestions in a blog. Pre and post surveys on students' attitudes towards programming and peer-coaching were administered to pre-university and first year college participants, finding an overall increase in the Likert scale for all the programming-related constructs under study (confidence, interest, gender, usefulness and professional) after the introductory course. As regards the peer-based learning approach, younger students seemed to be more eager to be taught in a less formal way than their older counterparts. The course resulted in high degrees of satisfaction for both the student tutors and their tutees.

AB  - This paper analyses six years of tutor feedback produced after inquiries made by students in a second linear algebra course at a university mathematics support center (MSC). We utilized Mason’s (2002) pedagogical tactics to build a model to analyze MSC tutors' feedback responding to these students’ queries. The aim of this research was to investigate the nature of students’ difficulties with concepts in a second linear algebra course that emphasizes theories and proof, in addition to examining the tactics employed by tutors to resolve student difficulties. We analyzed 227 feedback comments from 44 tutors based on their interactions with 82 students over six years. Our findings indicated that the most common areas of difficulty were basis, vector space, subspace, span, and proof. Tutor tactics deployed included ‘being mathematical’, ‘simplifying and complexifying’, and ‘worked examples’. We also discuss some implications for linear algebra tutor training.

AB  - Much progress has been made in reducing and refining animal use in toxicology testing, but progress in the use of new approach methodologies (NAMs) to replace animals is disappointing. There are many highly sophisticated NAMs available, but societal, regulatory and political barriers to their implementation remain. Change requires vision, starting with imagining a future where we are successful. Specifically, this would comprise the registration of safe and effective medicines without animal tests. How do we achieve this vision? Thinking differently, in silico methods could be used to provide a detailed assessment of target- and modality-related toxicological risks, coupled with modelling of exposure. In vitro NAMs such as microphysiological systems, microelectrode array and ion channel panels could then be employed to address hypothetical risks. Finally, the safety of first time in human trials could be assessed and assured using circulating nanobots that measure conventional clinical pathology parameters alongside new biomarkers such as circulating tissue DNA. This may seem the stuff of fantasy, but imagination is key to shaping a better future and all change starts with a vision, however far-fetched it may seem today.

AB  - The evolution of communication networks shows a clear shift of focus from just improving the communications aspects to enabling new important services, from Industry 4.0 to automated driving, virtual/augmented reality, the Internet of Things (IoT), and so on. This trend is evident in the roadmap planned for the deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) communication networks. This ambitious goal requires a paradigm shift toward a vision that looks at communication, computation, and caching (3C) resources as three components of a single holistic system. The further step is to bring these 3C resources closer to the mobile user, at the edge of the network, to enable very low latency and high reliability services. The scope of this chapter is to show that signal processing techniques can play a key role in this new vision. In particular, we motivate the joint optimization of 3C resources. Then we show how graph-based representations can play a key role in building effective learning methods and devising innovative resource allocation techniques.

The index of refraction does not need to be constant at infinity and may have some angular dependency as well as perturbations. We prove analytical results on the convergence of the approximate solution. Numerical examples for different shapes of the artificial boundary and for non-constant indexes of refraction will be presented.

AB  - Summary
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus leads to the incorporation of thousands of new granule cells into the dentate gyrus every month, but its function remains unclear. Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways.

AB  - Ecosystem management in the face of uncertain disturbances has triggered increasing practices of resilience thinking. A multiscale probabilistic simulation-optimization framework is developed based on the nested nature of watersheds to inform decision robustness for Best Management Practices (BMPs). We presented a novel approach using hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) as interpretable and probabilistic emulators of process-based models. The hybrid BNs established at the scale of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) are embedded into simulation-optimization, whereby we analyze the cost-effectiveness-robustness of candidate BMP strategies at the subbasin scale. The optimal strategy is identified in compliance with water quality standards using watershed-scale integer programming. We apply the approaches in a typical intensively cultivated plateau watershed adjacent to Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. Our findings suggest that the hybrid BNs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative information, are reliable emulators of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in capturing critical pathways of diffuse phosphorus. Tradeoffs among cost, effectiveness, and robustness follow the law of diminishing marginal benefits. The optimum BMP strategies vary with policymakers’ preference toward robustness levels. Our findings indicate that robustness should be accounted for as an additional decision attribute besides costs and pollution mitigation. The benefits of the modeling framework are to (i) reduce over 99% computation complexity and support efficient decision-making under multifaceted uncertainties; (ii) improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning emulators; and (iii) inform policymakers of robustness with the probability of water quality restoration success.

AB  - Modern technologies, such as RFID, offer never-before seen learning abilities to parts moving in supply chains. Logistics systems may be understood as complex adaptive logistics systems (CALS). They also may be conceived as electronic auction markets as ‘smart parts’ bid for the best routing and pricing from transportation firms. To ensure the world-wide functionality and efficiency of CALS transportation markets, we suggest the utility of an agent-based computational market design based on Blake LeBaron's stock-market model. Given that parts may be more or less smart, markets more or less complex, and self-organizing CALS systems probabilistically subject to the bullwhip effect, we suggest nine different computational CALS market-design options, offering more adaptivity to unexpected environmental contingencies.

AB  - It is important to assess the cumulative effects of technology on student achievement captured in the last 30 years of technologyenhanced mathematics instruction. Synthesizing the thousands of articles and gray literature on this subject is necessary but would require a considerable commitment of academic resources. A second-order metaanalysis or meta-analysis of meta-analyses is an alternative that is reasonable and effective. Thus, a second-order meta-analysis of 19 prior meta-analyses with minimum overlap between primary studies was conducted. The results represent 663 primary studies (approximately 141,733 participants) and 1,263 effect sizes. The random effects' mean effect size of .38 was statistically significantly different from zero. The results provide a historical and contextualized summary of 30 years of meta-analytic research, which supports meta-analytic thinking and better interpretation of future effect sizes. Results indicate that technology function and study quality are major contributors to effect size variation. Specifically, computation enhancement technologies were most effective, while studies that examine combinations of enhancements were least effective. Implications for technology-enhanced mathematics instruction and meta-analytic research are provided.

AB  - People frequently entertain counterfactual thoughts, or mental simulations about alternative ways the world could have been. But the perceived plausibility of those counterfactual thoughts varies widely. The current article interfaces research in the philosophy and semantics of counterfactual statements with the psychology of mental simulations, and it explores the role of perceived similarity in judgments of counterfactual plausibility. We report results from seven studies (N = 6405) jointly supporting three interconnected claims. First, the perceived plausibility of a counterfactual event is predicted by the perceived similarity between the possible world in which the imagined situation is thought to occur and the actual world. Second, when people attend to differences between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as less similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as less plausible. Lastly, when people attend to what is identical between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as more similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as more plausible. We discuss these results in light of philosophical, semantic, and psychological theories of counterfactual thinking.

AB  - We report an experiment in which subjects named 120 pictures, consisting of series of five pictures drawn from each of 24 semantic categories (and intermixed with 45 fillers). The number of intervening trials (lag) between successive presentations of members of the same category varied from two to eight. Subjects' naming latencies were slowed by 30ms for each preceding member of the category. This effect was both cumulative and linear, and unrelated to the lag elapsing since the previous presentation of a category member. These results definitively demonstrate the occurrence of cumulative interference for word retrieval by prior retrieval of other exemplars of the same semantic category—cumulative semantic inhibition. We claim that this inhibition effect could only occur if the spoken word production system possesses three specific properties (competition, priming, and sharing of semantic activation). We provide computational-modelling evidence in support of this claim. We show that no current theory of spoken word production has all of these properties. In their current form, all these theories are falsified by these results. We briefly discuss the obstacles that may be encountered by current models were they modified to account for our findings.

AB  - There is much debate over the degree to which language learning is governed by innate language-specific biases, or acquired through cognition-general principles. Here we examine the probabilistic language acquisition hypothesis on three levels: We outline a novel theoretical result showing that it is possible to learn the exact generative model underlying a wide class of languages, purely from observing samples of the language. We then describe a recently proposed practical framework, which quantifies natural language learnability, allowing specific learnability predictions to be made for the first time. In previous work, this framework was used to make learnability predictions for a wide variety of linguistic constructions, for which learnability has been much debated. Here, we present a new experiment which tests these learnability predictions. We find that our experimental results support the possibility that these linguistic constructions are acquired probabilistically from cognition-general principles.

We restrict attention to specific models for whole-number multiplication, hence the wording of the title. They support evolving thinking in large measure through the ways their users redesign them. They assume new forms, come to be seen and understood in different ways. We show how work that learners do with models can help them to transform, not simply their understanding of key concepts, but also how they come to view themselves as thinkers and learners, as collaborators in a social process that their work and thinking help to constitute. We draw on recent research on core knowledge, especially by Carey, Spelke, and Tomasello, to clarify how models, as we view them here, can underpin specific actions that support emerging understanding.

AB  - In a historical account recently published in this journal Dhein argues that the current debate whether insects like bees and ants use cognitive maps (centralized map hypothesis) or other means of navigation (decentralized network hypothesis) largely reflects the classical debate between American experimental psychologists à la Tolman and German ethologists à la Lorenz, respectively. In this dichotomy we, i.e., the proponents of the network hypothesis, are inappropriately placed on the Lorenzian line. In particular, we argue that in contrast to Dhein's claim our concepts are not based on merely instinctive or peripheral modes of information processing. In general, on the one side our approaches have largely been motivated by the early biocybernetics way of thinking. On the other side they are deeply rooted in studies on the insect's behavioral ecology, i.e., in the ecological setting within which the navigational strategies have evolved and within which the animal now operates. Following such a bottom-up approach we are not “anti-cognitive map researchers” but argue that the results we have obtained in ants, and also the results of some decisive experiments in bees, can be explained and simulated without the need of invoking metric maps.

AB  - Existing models that integrate emotion and cognition generally do not fully specify why cognition needs emotion and conversely why emotion needs cognition. In this paper, we present a unified computational model that combines an abstract cognitive theory of behavior control (PEACTIDM) and a detailed theory of emotion (based on an appraisal theory), integrated in a theory of cognitive architecture (Soar). The theory of cognitive control specifies a set of required computational functions and their abstract inputs and outputs, while the appraisal theory specifies in more detail the nature of these inputs and outputs and an ontology for their representation. We argue that there is a surprising functional symbiosis between these two independently motivated theories that leads to a deeper theoretical integration than has been previously obtained in other computational treatments of cognition and emotion. We use an implemented model in Soar to test the feasibility of the resulting integrated theory, and explore its implications and predictive power in several task domains.

AB  - OMiLAB is a community of practice which offers a digital ecosystem bringing together open technologies to investigate and apply conceptual modeling methods for varying purposes and domains. One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping – a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation. For design-oriented, artifact building research, a higher Technology Readiness Level can thus be achieved (compared to the level that idea development methods typically attain).

AB  - While agent-based modeling (ABM) has become one of the most powerful tools in quantitative social sciences, it remains difficult to explain their structure and performance. We propose to use artificial intelligence both to build the models from data, and to improve the way we communicate models to stakeholders. Although machine learning is actively employed for pre-processing data, here for the first time, we used it to facilitate model development of a simulation model directly from data. Our suggested framework, ML-ABM accounts for causality and feedback loops in a complex nonlinear system and at the same time keeps it transparent for stakeholders. As a result, beside the development of a behavioral ABM, we open the ‘blackbox’ of purely empirical models. With our approach, artificial intelligence in the simulation field can open a new stream in modeling practices and provide insights for future applications.

AB  - To achieve better classification performance using case-based reasoning classifiers, we propose a retrieval-based revision method with trustworthiness evaluation for problem solving. An improved case evaluation method is employed to evaluate the trustworthiness of the suggested solution after the reuse step, which will divide the target cases and its suggested solutions into a trustworthy set and an untrustworthy set in accordance with a threshold value of trustworthiness. The attribute weights are adjusted by running a genetic algorithm and are used in the second round of retrieval of the untrustworthy set to obtain the classification results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably compared with other methods. Also, the proposed method has less computation complexity for the trustworthiness evaluation, and enhances understanding on thinking and inference for case-based reasoning classifiers.

AB  - Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) have recently been proposed as a versatile generalization of Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs). In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of ADFs. Our results show that while ADFs are one level up in the polynomial hierarchy compared to AFs, there is a useful subclass of ADFs which is as complex as AFs while arguably offering more modeling capacities. As a technical vehicle, we employ the approximation fixpoint theory of Denecker, Marek and Truszczyński, thus showing that it is also a useful tool for complexity analysis of operator-based semantics.

AB  - Broiler represents approximately 1.5% of the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Brazil is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of chicken. Aiming to improve and sustain a competitive advantage, producers have invested in improvements in production systems in general, in particular aviary heating systems. However, producers need to choose the best among several alternatives of energy sources for heating. This decision impacts the environment to a greater or a lesser extent depending on the energy source chosen. The aim of this study is to develop a computational model to understand systemically and dynamically the environmental externalities based on the choice of energy source for aviary heating. The identification of criteria that influence the choice for heating systems was possible through a multiple case-study in the southern region of Brazil. By designing a computational model of system dynamics, it was possible to visualize scenarios using different energy sources and their respective negative environmental externalities. From the analysis of four scenarios, we sought to identify the one with the best relation to environmental and economic performance. It was evidenced that the scenario with the best relation was that using pellets as an energy source for aviary heating. The developed model may be applied to solve similar decision-making problems.

AB  - A new form of e-governance is proposed based on systems seen in biological life at all scales. This model of e-governance offers the performance of collective superintelligence, equally high ethical quality, and a substantial reduction in resource requirements for government functions. In addition, the problems seen in modern forms of government such as misrepresentation, corruption, lack of expertise, short-term thinking, political squabbling, and popularity contests may be rendered virtually obsolete by this approach. Lastly, this model of government generates a digital ecosystem of intelligent life which mirrors physical citizens, serving to bridge the emotional divide between physical and digital life, while also producing the first form of government able to keep pace with accelerating technological progress.

AB  - This paper argues that the history of the computer, of the practice of computation and of the notions of ‘data’ and ‘programme’ are essential for a critical account of the emergence and implications of data-driven research. In order to show this, I focus on the transition that the investigations on the worm C. elegans experienced in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Cambridge (UK). Throughout the 1980s, this research programme evolved from a study of the genetic basis of the worm’s development and behaviour to a DNA mapping and sequencing initiative. By examining the changing computing technologies which were used at the Laboratory, I demonstrate that by the time of this transition researchers shifted from modelling the worm’s genetic programme on a mainframe apparatus to writing minicomputer programs aimed at providing map and sequence data which was then circulated to other groups working on the genetics of C. elegans. The shift in the worm research should thus not be simply explained in the application of computers which transformed the project from hypothesis-driven to a data-intensive endeavour. The key factor was rather a historically specific technology—in-house and easy programmable minicomputers—which redefined the way of achieving the project’s long-standing goal, leading the genetic programme to co-evolve with the practices of data production and distribution.

AB  - Although there is a deep historical relationship between hydrology and society, the relationship has considerably evolved in the last three decades. Hydrologists, in particular those involved in designing of decision-support tools, are experiencing a widening gap between an academic discipline which has progressively moved away from field-based applied natural science to computational hydrology, and the multiplication of stakeholders involved in the water-related issues addressed by research. The challenge for hydrology is now to negotiate this shift and to rethink its engagement in society. This paper provides a description of a planned process designed to improve hydrology-society interactions and to foster reflexivity in socio-hydrology. Based on an interdisciplinary reflexive process undertaken in Tunisia from 2016 to 2020, we identified three types of discomforts in the dialogue with society, inviting scientists to lucidly engage with these discomforts. We formulated four key reflexive propositions to achieve a better alignment of scientific stance, research practices and discourse. The first proposition concerns the need to explain more clearly the value systems scientists engage in and with society. The second concerns the need to position hydrology in society and not outside it, by reconsidering the functions that research fulfils in society. The third is an invitation to redefine the perimeter of the research interlocutors and the way to reach them. The fourth is to revisit scientific practices to build on the strengths of the dialogue between field-based natural science and computational hydrology. The paper concludes that adopting a reflexive posture towards these four dimensions of the dialogue between hydrology and society is an effective way to overcome discomforts and to refocus research stance, practices and discourse. It is a way to renew hydrology's place in society and to contribute to the current thinking in socio-hydrology initiated by hydrologists.

AB  - Many cerebellar models use a form of synaptic plasticity that implements decorrelation learning. Parallel fibers carrying signals positively correlated with climbing-fiber input have their synapses weakened (long-term depression), whereas those carrying signals negatively correlated with climbing input have their synapses strengthened (long-term potentiation). Learning therefore ceases when all parallel-fiber signals have been decorrelated from climbing-fiber input. This is a computationally powerful rule for supervised learning and can be cast in a spike-timing dependent plasticity form for comparison with experimental evidence. Decorrelation learning is particularly well suited to sensory prediction, for example, in the reafference problem where external sensory signals are interfered with by reafferent signals from the organism’s own movements, and the required circuit appears similar to the one found to mediate classical eye blink conditioning. However, for certain stimuli, avoidance is a much better option than simple prediction, and decorrelation learning can also be used to acquire appropriate avoidance movements. One example of a stimulus to be avoided is retinal slip that degrades visual processing, and decorrelation learning appears to play a role in the vestibulo-ocular reflex that stabilizes gaze in the face of unpredicted head movements. Decorrelation learning is thus suitable for both sensory prediction and motor control. It may also be well suited for generic spatial and temporal coordination, because of its ability to remove the unwanted side effects of movement. Finally, because it can be used with any kind of time-varying signal, the cerebellum could play a role in cognitive processing.

AB  - Children who hear large amounts of diverse speech learn language more quickly than children who do not. However, high correlations between the amount and the diversity of the input in speech samples makes it difficult to isolate the influence of each. We overcame this problem by controlling the input to a computational model so that amount of exposure to linguistic input (quantity) and the quality of that input (lexical diversity) were independently manipulated. Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children’s data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4). A language input that is rich in lexical diversity outperforms equivalent richness in quantity for learned sublexical and lexical knowledge, for well-established language tests, and for acquiring words that have never been encountered before.

AB  - Starting from the study of an architect who designs in the absence of sight, we question to what extent prevailing notions of design may be complemented with alternative articulations. In doing so, we point to the cognitivist understanding of human cognition underlying design researchers' strong attention to ‘visual thinking’, and contrast this with more situated understandings of human cognition. The ontological and epistemological differences between both raise questions about how design research is produced, and consequently what design can also be. By accounting for how a blind architect re-articulates prevailing notions of design, we invite researchers to keep the discussion open and call for an ontological and epistemological re-articulation in design research.

AB  - This chapter provides an overview of the potentials of employing computational design methods and digital fabrication tools for the creation of novel, material-based design. Just as in the early days of architecture, when the master builder was responsible for all areas of building, these new technologies allow a return to the exploration of experimental design methods and the direct exchange with different materials. Designing for and through digital production techniques thus shifts the focus from formal design representations toward the physically realized. As such, material and tectonic thinking are reintroduced as the very base of the design approach. Due to this a new type of design becomes possible with a formerly unknown degree of complexity—both on a formal and on a functional level. This chapter gives an overview of the history of design, speaks about the so-called “digital continuum,” highlights the benefits of customization and individual production, stresses the nuisance of new esthetic formalizations and the importance of education to mediate such understanding to students of design and architecture.

AB  - Examining who (and what) stands to gain and lose in the smart city, and what kind of urban life smart cities create, are questions of a philosophical and ethical import. Since the early 2010s scholars and journalists have critiqued the smart city paradigm and examined its various projects and experimental initiatives to surface its ethical dimensions and significance. The smart city's rhetorical swing from tech-centric to human-centric and from smart city to smart citizen is construed here as a further effort to create the image of a more ethical smart city. Consequently, the topic of ethics has also intersected with the smart city in particular ways, and predominantly through the lens of data governance and the protection of privacy rights. This chapter argues for an expanded approach to smart city ethics. It proposes a focus on urban technology design to bridge the gap between a micro-ethical focus on data ethics and macro-level political-ethical critique. Bringing philosophical thinking on technology together with a design-led approach to urban technology is argued to provide a further way to draw out a potentially different set of ethical concerns and to explore how urban life can be lived with technology.

AB  - The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a methodological pathway from theories of situated, embodied cognition to simulations with an eye to empirical evidence, and suggest a possible cross-fertilization between cognitive robotics and psychology. Psychological theories, in particular those formulated at an abstract level, include models which are often severely underspecified at the level of mechanisms. This is true in the synchronic, constructive perspective (how can the effects observed in experiments be concretely generated by the model's mechanisms?) and in the diachronic, developmental perspective (how can such mechanisms be learned and developed?). The synthetic method of artificial cognitive systems research, and in particular of cognitive robotics, can complement research in psychology (and neurosciences) by exploring the constructive and developmental aspects of theories. Our second aim is to provide an example of such a methodology by describing simulations aiming at developing a perceptual symbol system (PSS) (Barsalou, 1999). We then describe the two main theoretical constructs of the PSS, perceptual symbols and simulators, illustrate their development in an artificial system, and test the system in prediction, categorization, and abstraction tasks.

AB  - The present study employed commercial computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS 2019R3 to explore the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the net heat flux reduction (NHFR) for the comparison of the five selected shaped holes and conventional cylindrical holes between the pressure surface, the suction surface and the leading edge. Amo4ng the shape parameters of shaped holes, the lateral divergence angle (β) and the forward divergence angle (δ) were fixed as 12° and 7° in all shaped holes structures, respectively. The others varied with different regions of the turbine vane. Results showed that different holes fit different positions of vanes. On the suction surface, laidback holes performed the worst net heat flux reduction in most blowing ratios conditions, which indicated the forward divergence angle was not conducive to the flow field and heat transfer characteristics on the suction surface. Whereas, the lateral divergence angle was beneficial to the film cooling and heat transfer characteristics. Laidback fan-shaped holes performed the best adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, but once simultaneously thinking about the heat transfer, fan-shaped holes performed better in net heat flux reduction due to less vortices at holes exit. On the leading edge, the divergence angle towards the upper wall (the lateral divergence angle of spanwise expansion holes) of vanes was not conducive to steady flow. And conical holes performed best, which indicated that coolant from holes with axial divergence angles (the lateral divergence angle in axial direction of conical holes) under the influence of mainstream impact could perform higher film cooling effectiveness and more stable flow fields. On the pressure surface, holes had a lateral divergence angle in the direction of vane height, which was conducive to increasing the coolant coverage area and improving the ability to attach to the pressure surface. Additionally, the laidback hole case was observed the lowest net heat flux reduction when the blowing ratio was less than 2, which revealed that holes that expanded only in flow direction was not conducive to film cooling and heat transfer characteristics.

AB  - The aim of this article is to motivate and describe the parameter ecology program, which studies how different parameters contribute to the difficulty of classical problems. We call for a new type of race in parameterized analysis, with the purpose of uncovering the boundaries of tractability by finding the smallest possible parameterizations which admit FPT-algorithms or polynomial kernels. An extensive overview of recent advances on this front is presented for the Vertex Cover problem. Moving even beyond the parameter ecology program we advocate the principle of model enrichment, which raises the challenge of generalizing positive results to problem definitions with greater modeling power. The computational intractability which inevitably emerges can be deconstructed by introducing additional parameters, leading towards a theory of fully multivariate algorithmics.
