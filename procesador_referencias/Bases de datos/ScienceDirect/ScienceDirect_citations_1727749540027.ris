AB  - New efforts are using head cameras and eye-trackers worn by infants to capture everyday visual environments from the point of view of the infant learner. From this vantage point, the training sets for statistical learning develop as the sensorimotor abilities of the infant develop, yielding a series of ordered datasets for visual learning that differ in content and structure between timepoints but are highly selective at each timepoint. These changing environments may constitute a developmentally ordered curriculum that optimizes learning across many domains. Future advances in computational models will be necessary to connect the developmentally changing content and statistics of infant experience to the internal machinery that does the learning.

AB  - In recent years, we have observed an increase in the diversity of the processors ecosystem. Different designs and architectures are being studied based on their performance and power characteristics. While using benchmarks for this purpose allows for reproducibility and easy understanding of the results, using real scientific applications allows researchers to realize the actual implications of each design on the overall performance of their codes. This paper analyzes the performance of different implementations of a three-point angular correlation function. This function is used in the study of Large-Scale Distribution of galaxies in a variety of computational platforms. The function is based on histogram construction and presents a large computational cost. This cost dramatically increases with the size of the datasets. We have considered two different GPUs, a set of x86 Intel machines (multi- and many-core), ARM chipsets, as well as an FPGA. We first study the best possible implementation for each platform in terms of time to solution. We then compare the power used by those platforms for a predefined number of datasets. Energy is one of the main constraints that computer architects are facing nowadays. The results will be used to evaluate the performance of this function considering those two targets – time and energy – for those platforms and to analyze the suitability of each of those platforms for this specific problem.

AB  - The Laser Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) category of Additive Manufacturing (AM) is currently receiving much attention for computational process modelling. Major challenges exist in how to reconcile resolution, energy and time in a real build, with the practical limitations of resolution (layer height and mesh resolution), energy (heat format and magnitude) and time (heating and cooling step times) in the computational space. A novel thermomechanical PBF-LB process model including an efficient powder-interface heat loss mechanism was developed. The effect of variations in layer height (layer scaling), energy and time on the temperature and stress evolution was investigated. The influence of heating step time and cooling step time was characterised and the recommended ratio of element size to layer scaling was presented, based on a macroscale 2D model. The layer scaling method was effective when scaling up to 4 times the layer thickness and appropriately also scaling the cooling step time. This research provides guidelines and a framework for layer scaling for finite element modelling of the PBF-LB process.

AB  - The problem of measurement in psychology is as old as experimental psychology. One narrow domain of psychology is privileged, in that it admits an absolute scale: a ratio scale of measurement with a point of origin. That domain is the assessment of shape or form through vision. Poincaré, Cassirer, and Gibson approached this topic by studying invariants, specifically projective invariants. In the study of vision, shapes should be measured in projective terms. As a convention or a strategy, measurement in projective terms may be conducted without hindrance. Many objections have been posed to the measurement of shape in projective terms; nearly all misrepresent basic geometric ideas. Projective invariants provide the right tools to evaluate goodness of shape constancy, and it provides these tools in its own right (in contrast to measures like distance and angle). Under conditions that allow shape constancy in human vision, sometimes stable estimates of projective invariants by observers do not match projective invariants at the eye. Some examples are given for projective invariants of coplanar conics, the computation of the measures is discussed, current objections to the approach are addressed, and consequences are drawn for the study of visual shape constancy.

AB  - Premixed methane-air flame propagation in a two-dimensional half-open tube is studied using a computational fluid dynamic method. The flame is simulated using a laminar combustion model with simplified reaction mechanism. The first purpose of this work is to determine whether a 2D planar flame model can be used to predict flame propagation in a square-section tube. Another purpose is to investigate the evolution of the flame tip velocity after the flame skirt touches the wall, using the relationship between the flame surface area and the burnt gas volume growth. The simulation results show that the 2D planar flame model is not suitable for predicting the flame propagation in a square-section tube, and that the simulated position of the flame tip is reliable only when the flame skirt touches the wall. There is an approximate proportional relationship between the volume growth of burnt gas and the flame tip velocity even after the lateral flame touches the wall. The widely used equation for the relationship between burnt gas volume growth and flame surface area fails after the flame touches the wall, and then holds at several later times. The balance is broken by the continuous extinction of the flame skirt. Finally, we report the dimensionless time interval between when the flame skirt touches the wall and flame front inversion, as well as the dimensionless velocity of the flame skirt. There are some differences between the values of the dimensionless time interval in 2D planar tubes and in 3D cylindrical tubes.

AB  - Green chemistry aims to design chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. The design of chemicals for reduced hazard selects the properties and attributes that provide the desired function while avoiding unintended consequences for human health and the environment. The tools and knowledge that are available to designers have increased considerably in recent years. Importantly, the approach and goals of design have evolved and become more holistic, multi-disciplinary, and inclusive. This is notable as the global population׳s continued economic and social well-being cannot be maintained with measures that destroy our natural environment. Sustainable chemistry promotes, advances, enables, and empowers the implementation of the chemistry of sustainability and includes chemical design for reduced hazard. In this chapter, we consider the design of chemicals for reduced hazard (safer chemical design) focusing on the past and present, and importantly, looking to the future on what lies ahead.

AB  - Decision-making under uncertainty is important for managing human-natural systems in a changing world. A major source of uncertainty is linked to the multi-actor settings of decisions with poorly understood values, complex relationships, and conflicting management approaches. Despite general agreement across disciplines on co-producing knowledge for viable and inclusive outcomes in a multi-actor context, there is still limited conceptual clarity and no systematic understanding on what co-production means in decision-making under uncertainty and how it can be approached. Here, we use content analysis and clustering to systematically analyse 50 decision-making cases with multiple time and spatial scales across 26 countries and in 9 different sectors in the last decade to serve two aims. The first is to synthesise the key recurring strategies that underpin high quality decision co-production across many cases of diverse features. The second is to identify important deficits and opportunities to leverage existing strategies towards flourishing co-production in support of decision-making. We find that four general strategies emerge centred around: promoting innovation for robust and equitable decisions; broadening the span of co-production across interacting systems; fostering social learning and inclusive participation; and improving pathways to impact. Additionally, five key areas that should be addressed to improve decision co-production are identified in relation to: participation diversity; collaborative action; power relationships; governance inclusivity; and transformative change. Characterising the emergent strategies and their key areas for improvement can help guide future works towards more pluralistic and integrated science and practice.

AB  - Offshore oil and gas production utilizes several renewable energy technologies to meet its energy requirements and to enhance oil recovery (EOR). Using renewable energy can diminish fuel consumption and maintenance costs in upstream processes. In addition to reducing noise, emissions, and improving safety, renewable energy can reduce pollution. As an alternative to natural gas, solar thermal EOR utilizes concentrated solar power (CSP). For the Miraah project in the Amal oil field in Oman, solar energy was used to generate steam. 10% of the total steam are produced during phase one of the project. This study presents a computational simulation of the phase one Miraah project, where the total amount of heat necessary to convert 100 gals of cold water to steam at 450 degrees Fahrenheit and 414.7 psi are calculated. According to the results, the total steam injection per hour is 637 tons with a 3.46 % error percentage from that in Miraah project.

AB  - Poetry and prose are written artistic expressions that help us appreciate the reality we live in. Each of these styles has its own set of subjective properties, such as rhyme and rhythm, which are easily caught by a human reader’s eye and ear. With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, the gap between humans and machines may have decreased, and today we observe algorithms mastering tasks that were once exclusively performed by humans. In this paper, we propose a computational method to distinguish between poetry and prose based solely on aural and rhythmic properties. In order to compare prose and poetry rhythms, we represent the rhymes and phonemes as temporal sequences, and thus, we propose a procedure for extracting rhythmic features from these sequences. The performance of this procedure is evaluated by the use of popular machine learning classifiers, and the best accuracy was obtained with a multilayer perceptron neural network. Interestingly, by using an approach based on complex networks to visualize the similarities between the different texts considered, we found that the patterns of poetry vary more than prose. Consequently, a richer and more complex set of rhythmic possibilities tends to be found in that modality.

This paper aims to center the experiences of three cohorts (n = 40) of Black high school students who participated in a critical race technology course that exposed anti-blackness as the organizing logic and default setting of digital and artificially intelligent technology. This paper centers the voices, experiences and technological innovations of the students, and in doing so, introduces a new type of digital literacy: critical race algorithmic literacy.
Design/methodology/approach
Data for this study include student interviews (called “talk backs”), journal reflections and final technology presentations.
Findings
Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world.
Originality/value
While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems.

AB  - How does processing differ during purely symbolic problem solving versus when mathematical operations can be mentally associated with meaningful (here, visuospatial) referents? Learners were trained on novel math operations (↓, ↑), that were defined strictly symbolically or in terms of a visuospatial interpretation (operands mapped to dimensions of shaded areas, answer = total area). During testing (scanner session), no visuospatial representations were displayed. However, we expected visuospatially-trained learners to form mental visuospatial representations for problems, and exhibit distinct activations. Since some solution intervals were long (~10s) and visuospatial representations might only be instantiated in some stages during solving, group differences were difficult to detect when treating the solving interval as a whole. However, an HSMM-MVPA process (Anderson and Fincham, 2014a) to parse fMRI data identified four distinct problem-solving stages in each group, dubbed: 1) encode; 2) plan; 3) compute; and 4) respond. We assessed stage-specific differences across groups. During encoding, several regions implicated in general semantic processing and/or mental imagery were more active in visuospatially-trained learners, including: bilateral supramarginal, precuneus, cuneus, parahippocampus, and left middle temporal regions. Four of these regions again emerged in the computation stage: precuneus, right supramarginal/angular, left supramarginal/inferior parietal, and left parahippocampal gyrus. Thus, mental visuospatial representations may not just inform initial problem interpretation (followed by symbolic computation), but may scaffold on-going computation. In the second stage, higher activations were found among symbolically-trained solvers in frontal regions (R. medial and inferior and L. superior) and the right angular and middle temporal gyrus. Activations in contrasting regions may shed light on solvers’ degree of use of symbolic versus mental visuospatial strategies, even in absence of behavioral differences.

Searching every article and conference paper related to the topic published until May 04, 2020, 59 studies were found and classified into two main topics: marketing studies (35), mostly focused on evaluating or exploring advertising in SV, and computational studies (24), focusing on the development of systems for the insertion of ads into SV. All knowledge present in these studies was summarized so that readers (both scholars and practitioners) could have easy access to the main contributions and information present in each study. Moreover, future research directions in six main themes are presented through a research agenda.

Tested in a variety of educational settings, this method, which I call ‘I3’ for its three-layer operation of ‘Imitation, Iteration and Improvisation’, allows learners to develop their sensory experiences to improvise and create on their own. I introduce case studies in order to test I3. I challenge the separation of design and construction often reinforced by the use of digital fabrication. I show that learning to make and learning from making emerge together through a situated and embodied interaction among the learner, the materials, the tools and the object in-the-making.

AB  - We offer a framework for the design and use of Ambient Smart Environments (ASEs) for preventive mental health care support. Drawing from Complex Systems Theory (CST) and ‘E’ Cognitive Science (ECS), we claim that ASEs have the potential to act in a preventive capacity in support of good mental health, i.e. supporting dynamics that avoid so-called “struck states” (which are, according to CST, thought generally to underpin forms of psychopathology). Here, we frame our discussion with what has recently been termed the “mind-technology problem”. We define and characterise ASE systems, present some examples, and briefly survey some existing theoretical work. After introducing the essential CST terminology, the paper goes on to apply CST to explain developmental adaptation to continuously changing (smart) environments. Understanding the ASE’s navigation in terms of a dynamic geometry between attracting and repelling points (or local minima/local maxima), allows us to develop neurotechnology that can augment clinical interventions by predicting upcoming shifts for good symptomatic outcomes, i.e. when a preventive intervention (i.e. destabilisation) should take place. We further offer clear directions for the development and design of such neurotechnology.

AB  - A computational model based on the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation for simulating the onset and kinetics of austenite to bainite and martensite transformation has been fitted to experimental continuous cooling data for two different steels. We investigated how deformation below recrystallization temperature affected the transformation onset and kinetics in comparison to the same steel in the undeformed state. The fitted model can be used to simulate phase transformations occurring when the steel is cooled along any cooling path. The model can be fully coupled to heat transfer and conduction simulations in order to optimize cooling practice, for example in industrial thermomechanical processing of steel. The fitted model can also be used to predict the hardness of the steel after cooling.

AB  - Virtual Fixtures (VF) are defined as haptic or visual aids in assisting users of virtual and tele-operation environments during various tasks. They have been mostly defined similar to physical fixtures which are used in performing daily tasks such as holding-on to the railing when climbing the stairs or using a ruler to draw straight lines. Such analogous definitions can be even extended to the case of learning certain manual tasks under supervision, e.g. when one holds the child's hand in order to teach the association between the mouse movements and positions of cursor on the screen. This paper presents how notions from the computational mechanics for solving constrained dynamical systems can be extended for stable implementation of a class of VF in a haptic rendered environment. It is shown that some of the solution methodologies from computational mechanics can have direct implication in haptic rendering of stiff-constrained environment. Examples of such implementations are also presented using a haptic device interacting with a class of VF.

AB  - The emergence of modern humans with their extraordinary cognitive capacities is ascribed to a novel type of cognitive computational process (sustained non-routine multi-level operations) required for abstract projectuality, held to be the common denominator of the cognitive capacities specific to modern humans. A brain operation (latching) that allows this novel computational process is proposed as well as a physics-inspired mechanism that could explain its rather recent emergence without invoking unlikely genetic or structural changes.

The integrated STEM approach does present challenges for implementation such as practitioners having insufficient knowledge of STEM disciplines. Robotics and Makerspace are suggested as viable strategies for integrated STEM education.

AB  - Digital tools and practices are transforming societal relationships with non-human worlds—whether through smartphone apps that city dwellers use to navigate urban forests, robotic bees that pollinate crops, or webcams that livestream rare birds' nests. Recent academic and popular interest in the coming together of digital and natural worlds has generated both creative and critical reflections on what the digital means for the very concept of nature, troubling the latter's ontological stability. In this Introduction to the special issue Digital Natures: Reworking Epistemologies, Ontologies and Politics we claim that the digital, when considered beyond an epistemological register, is a productive and political force that is unsettling, rather than reinforcing, the boundaries between society and nature. We review the extensive body of work from across geography and the social sciences that is actively engaging with digital–nature intersections, and historicise current debates through reference to the figures of the cyborg, technonatures, biomimicry and digital organisms. Asking whether digitalized practices of sensing, abstraction and algorithmic recombination simply mirror a pre-existing and external Nature, or whether they advance a reconceptualization of nature, we set out to trace the progressive political potential of a digitally-entangled ontological redefinition of nature. We discuss how, within emerging digital natures, agencies are entangled in a reimagining of what both nature and society are about. Here, we argue, lies the transformative potential of digital natures—precisely in challenging and subverting the ontological place of an external Nature. The introduction finishes by simultaneously outlining a research agenda for digital natures and presenting the six papers that comprise the special issue.

AB  - As a fundamental granular computing strategy, neighborhood granulation has been acknowledged as an intuitive and effective approach to feature evaluation and selection. However, such an approach always has a bias towards a fixed neighborhood granularity, while ignoring the observations across different levels of granularity. To this end, a novel algorithm based on Neighborhood relevancY, redundancY, and granularity interactivitY (N3Y) is proposed. Technically, N3Y adheres well to the rudiment of three-way decision, evaluating and selecting features in threes: 1) feature-to-class relevancy; 2) feature-to-feature redundancy; 3) granularity-to-granularity interactivity. Specifically, firstly, the neighborhood symmetrical uncertainty induced by neighborhood measures is adopted to evaluate the relevancy and redundancy of candidate feature subset; secondly, the proposed neighborhood granularity interactivity allows an uncertainty quantification for finer-to-coarser granularity, and is leveraged as a supplemental factor to guide the relevancy and redundancy, making our procedure more comprehensive; thirdly, a forward-greedy selector is devised, which is required to maximize the evaluation criterion integrating neighborhood relevancy, redundancy, and granularity interactivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that N3Y outperforms several other advanced feature selectors.

This case requires you to determine the appropriate financial accounting treatment and assess the reporting implications for Bitcoin using FASB’s authoritative guidance. The modular nature of the case allows students to address these requirements for three different clients: a Bitcoin miner, a Bitcoin trader, and a retailer that accepts Bitcoin as payment. As students complete the case, they are required to think critically about how the new guidance affects each client. Several features of the case allow instructors to adjust the level of difficulty so that they can create case assignments that are appropriate for both undergraduate and graduate accounting classes. Students who completed the case report that they found it to be realistic, interesting, and challenging.

AB  - An individual’s knowledge is collective in at least two senses: it often comes from other people’s testimony, and its deployment in reasoning and action requires accuracy underwritten by other people’s knowledge. What must one know to participate in a collective knowledge system? Here, we marshal evidence that individuals retain detailed causal information for a few domains and coarse causal models embedding markers indicating that these details are available elsewhere (others’ heads or the physical world) for most domains. This framework yields further questions about metacognition, source credibility, and individual computation that are theoretically and practically important. Belief polarization depends on the web of epistemic dependence and is greatest for those who know the least, plausibly due to extreme conflation of others’ knowledge with one’s own.

AB  - As a major equipment for thermal power plants, the main function of coarse powder separators is to separate particles into size groups according to particle diameter. With the rising coal prices, power plants are using more low-density lignite. Consequently, the original equipment does not operate under normal conditions. Therefore, to return the equipment to normal operating conditions, the isokinetic sampling method, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and discrete phase model (DPM) based on the Euler–Lagrange method are applied in this research to analyze the effect of baffle shapes, baffle numbers, and centrifugal blades on the equipment performance index, like R90. The shape of the baffle plate was optimized and improved. Preferential method was applied to determine the optimal number of baffles to ensure normal working conditions. Results show that curved baffles can suppress the axial negative gradient field below themselves better than rectangular baffles. The curved baffles selected by the optimal seeking method make full use of the negative axial gradient field and provide the particles entering the separation zone at tangential velocity in advance with the addition of centrifugal blades. Thus, pre-separation can be realized. The R90 is 5 at the separator outlet and 95 at the powder return port, indicating that the output capacity of the separator returned to a reasonable operating performance.

AB  - Biological neural networks are systems of extraordinary computational capabilities shaped by evolution, development, and lifelong learning. The interplay of these elements leads to the emergence of biological intelligence. Inspired by such intricate natural phenomena, Evolved Plastic Artificial Neural Networks (EPANNs) employ simulated evolution in-silico to breed plastic neural networks with the aim to autonomously design and create learning systems. EPANN experiments evolve networks that include both innate properties and the ability to change and learn in response to experiences in different environments and problem domains. EPANNs’ aims include autonomously creating learning systems, bootstrapping learning from scratch, recovering performance in unseen conditions, testing the computational advantages of particular neural components, and deriving hypotheses on the emergence of biological learning. Thus, EPANNs may include a large variety of different neuron types and dynamics, network architectures, plasticity rules, and other factors. While EPANNs have seen considerable progress over the last two decades, current scientific and technological advances in artificial neural networks are setting the conditions for radically new approaches and results. Exploiting the increased availability of computational resources and of simulation environments, the often challenging task of hand-designing learning neural networks could be replaced by more autonomous and creative processes. This paper brings together a variety of inspiring ideas that define the field of EPANNs. The main methods and results are reviewed. Finally, new opportunities and possible developments are presented.

AB  - In this paper, a novel probabilistic multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for sustainable and resilient building design solutions selection is developed to optimize alternatives or rehabilitation strategies in a life cycle context. The proposed framework holistically takes into account the buildings' resilience metrics, environmental sustainability, and energy consumption. The life cycle economic cost, global warming potential (GWP), primary energy use (PEU), and social impact are used to represent the buildings’ resilience and sustainability. The second-generation Performance-based Earthquake Engineering procedure and FEMA P-58 method for time-based seismic performance analyses are used to evaluate earthquake-induced impact. The whole-building energy modeling (BEM) is adopted to assess energy use during the operational phase. In addition, life cycle analysis (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) are carried out to assess the life cycle performance of different design alternatives regarding environmental impacts and cost, respectively. Aiming to consider the various uncertainties in the decision-making process, a novel MCS-MCDM method is developed by combining the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with the traditional MCDM method. The proposed framework is applied to analyze hypothetical cases considering different geographic locations, structural systems, and building envelope systems, and recommendations are given according to the analysis results. The case study demonstrates the advantages of the proposed framework over traditional frameworks and its guidance for architectural design decisions.

AB  - Previous neuroimaging studies of spatial perspective taking have tended not to activate the brain's mentalising network. We predicted that a task that requires the use of perspective taking in a communicative context would lead to the activation of mentalising regions. In the current task, participants followed auditory instructions to move objects in a set of shelves. A 2×2 factorial design was employed. In the Director factor, two directors (one female and one male) either stood behind or next to the shelves, or were replaced by symbolic cues. In the Object factor, participants needed to use the cues (position of the directors or symbolic cues) to select one of three possible objects, or only one object could be selected. Mere presence of the Directors was associated with activity in the superior dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the superior/middle temporal sulci, extending into the extrastriate body area and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), regions previously found to be responsive to human bodies and faces respectively. The interaction between the Director and Object factors, which requires participants to take into account the perspective of the director, led to additional recruitment of the superior dorsal MPFC, a region activated when thinking about dissimilar others' mental states, and the middle temporal gyri, extending into the left temporal pole. Our results show that using perspective taking in a communicative context, which requires participants to think not only about what the other person sees but also about his/her intentions, leads to the recruitment of superior dorsal MPFC and parts of the social brain network.

AB  - The primary objectives of pharmaceutical development encompass identifying the routes, processes, and conditions for producing medicines while establishing a control strategy to ensure acceptable quality attributes throughout the commercial manufacturing lifecycle. However, achieving these goals is challenged by uncertainties surrounding design decisions for the manufacturing process and variations in manufacturing methods resulting in distributions of outcomes during production. In this discussion, we focus on Bayesian approaches to quantify uncertainty and guide decision-making in process development.Bayesian modeling with Markov chain Monte Carlo proves effective in estimating process reliability. Recent advancements in surrogate models (e.g. Gaussian process, decision trees, and neural networks) offer novel means to quantify uncertainty and have shown success in designing experimental plans that reduce the number of required experiments to determine the optimal process design. By leveraging Bayesian approaches, chemical engineers can enhance their ability to navigate complex decision landscapes and optimize processes for improved efficiency and reliability.

AB  - Pathway modeling and simulation analysis is an important aspect of systems biology, and it has always acted as a key player in providing useful meaning to the high-throughput biological data. For the sake of a better understanding of the complex biological systems, pathways need to be modeled. Whenever computation-based modeling is done, it provides an insight into the study of behaviors of various biochemical pathways. Biological network, thus generated, helps in better understanding of the relationships between genes, proteins (enzymes), and other key components. Several databases and tools have been designed for the detailed study of the biological networks. By adding the simulating environments to the modeled pathways can further enhance the information about their behaviors in different conditions with respect to time. Thus these approaches are helpful in dissecting the complexity of biological systems and this information will be further utilized to solve various biological problems.

Have you ever deeply considered the intersections between research and education, particularly for second-level students? Traditionally, the convergence of these two realms is most often noted when considering the integration of research findings into educational practices or the involvement of, typically a small number, of students in research activities. While these practices have demonstrated efficacy, the fields of scientific research and education are evolving rapidly, necessitating a reevaluation of how we can optimize their convergence. In our discourse, we delve into these evolving trends, uncover the potential for greater integration, and, ultimately, enhance outcomes using the citizen science initiative Kefir4All as an illustrative example.

AB  - The improvement of the human condition is the driver behind a vast amount of ongoing research and naturally employs the most up-to-date methods in its endeavours. It has contributed greatly to our understanding of the body and benefitted our healthcare systems in remarkable ways, but there is a problem. The mapping of anatomy to its physiological functions is essentially derived from the work of Vesalius and traditionally favoured mobility over stability, and as a consequence has allowed the entrenched and simplifying assumptions of the musculoskeletal duality to persist to the present day, despite advances in technology. The lever model of motion, for example, assumes that the body is an intrinsically unstable system that requires an external controller (e.g. neural) to provide the necessary ‘catch-up’ stability for transient muscular latencies, and it is likely that the vulnerabilities inherent within such a mechanism would severely compromise living tissues. The foundational biomechanical assumptions of steady-state forces and kinematics has meant that the disproportionate and potentially damaging consequences of transient peak loadings have been largely overlooked, and which added to the long healing times required for post-traumatic recovery, suggests that such a mechanism would lead to material fatigue and destructive tissue failure. The musculoskeletal duality, however, was not always so dominant but conceptually rivalled in the 17th and 18th centuries by Hooke’s ‘cells’ and Malpighi’s ‘cellular tissues’, both of which have been largely forgotten but now deserve a re-evaluation. The definition of the term ‘cell’ as a small compartment within a larger structure had quite different connotations then than it does today, but this compartmental aspect of connective tissue anatomy gradually faded and is now only recognized for its pathological significance. This paper examines musculoskeletal anatomy from both historical and more recent viewpoints and highlights the concept of the fascial system as a distinct and intrinsically stable functional entity. It is a perspective that enables every anatomical ‘part’ to be included within a ‘cellular’ framework that differs substantially from the mobility-driven machine model: a tensioned fibrous network encompassing a complex heterarchy of regionally specialized compartments under compression, each of which has its own physical and parenchyma-driven characteristics that contribute to the functional whole. In other words, an updated fascia-centric interpretation of architectural anatomy that maps muscles and bones in a substantially different way from traditional models, renders the term musculoskeletal obsolete and greatly expands the meaning of compartment syndrome.

There is an immediate opportunity to use NAMs in safety assessment where the vision is to be able to predict risk more rapidly, accurately, and efficiently to further assure consumer safety. In order to achieve this, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) have developed a roadmap towards acceptance and integration of these new approach methodologies into safety and risk assessments for regulatory decision making. The roadmap provides a UK blueprint for the transition of NAMs from the research laboratory to their use in regulatory decision making. This will require close collaboration across disciplines (chemists, toxicologists, informaticians, risk assessors and others), and across chemical sectors, to develop, verify and utilise appropriate models. Linking up internationally, and harmonization will be fundamental.

AB  - In celebration of the first 60 years of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, several studies of hypersonic flows dominated by rate-dependent energetic processes are revisited. The work presented shows the evolution and advancement of computational capabilities in this area, and illustrates some key lessons learned over the previous decade or so. Early work with Leyva and Hornung in the California Institute of Technology T5 Free-Piston Shock Tunnel had the goal of validating thermochemical models for high-enthalpy flows. Several of these flows are re-analyzed with more advanced numerical methods, resulting in improved comparisons with the experimental measurements. This work was followed by a series of experiments in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center (now CUBRC Inc.) facilities at lower enthalpy conditions. Initial comparisons were poor, but with a better understanding of the facility behavior and the inclusion of key finite-rate processes, excellent agreement was obtained for nitrogen flows. An interesting study related to plasmadynamics and finite-rate processes in a different type of flow is discussed. Finally, it is shown that recent advances in numerical methods that are beginning to enable the direct numerical simulation of key rate-dependent energetic processes in hypersonic flows.

AB  - The rate of malicious behavior in online social media is increasing daily. The increase in malignant social behaviors, especially those involving hate speech, makes it necessary to identify haters from digital texts as quickly and accurately as possible. Recently, many studies have been conducted to identify such behaviors; however, profiling the haters’ personality has not been paid sufficient attention. Retrieving the personality profiles of suspected haters from digital texts is one of the most effective ways to distinguish them from others. This study proposes a novel hatebase-aided personality recognition model that gives more successful results than plain recognition models and predicts the discriminative personality traits of online haters. The proposed model contains the combination of two effective sub-models; a deep neural network model, and a fine-tuned BERT model. While the deep neural network model trained with hate indicators provides an interpretable relation between personality and hate indicators, the fine-tuned BERT model provides relationships between text semantics and personality. Combining these sub-models, the proposed model gives hatebase-related personality recognition results. This study evaluates two popular personality models: the Big Five and the MBTI. According to experiments, compared with other users, online haters are less agreeable regarding the Big Five and fewer thinkers regarding the MBTI.

AB  - Detecting objects of varied sizes in high resolution images is difficult due to the challenges of high memory requirement and huge computation burden. Existing state-of-the-art detectors perform well on low resolution images. However, its performance is greatly limited on high resolution images. In this paper, we propose a selective region enlargement network, called SRENet, which significantly reduces processing time and memory requirement while remaining high detection accuracy. The proposed SRENet does not need to conduct detection on original high resolution images but only needs to conduct detection on down-sampled images and some zoom-in regions selected from high resolution images. SRENet first conducts coarse detection on a low resolution image, and then sequentially selects promising regions that are expected to be analyzed at a higher resolution. Specifically, SRENet is built upon Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) and it outputs an action-reward map. The value of the reward map indicates the possibility that the action can improve detection accuracy. The region selected by the action with the maximum reward value will be analyzed further at a higher resolution. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate SRENet on two challenging datasets obtaining high resolution images. Experimental results show that SRENet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with high efficiency.

AB  - The neurovisceral integration (NVI) model was originally proposed to account for observed relationships between peripheral physiology, cognitive performance, and emotional/physical health. This model has also garnered a considerable amount of empirical support, largely from studies examining cardiac vagal control. However, recent advances in functional neuroanatomy, and in computational neuroscience, have yet to be incorporated into the NVI model. Here we present an updated/expanded version of the NVI model that incorporates these advances. Based on a review of studies of structural/functional anatomy, we first describe an eight-level hierarchy of nervous system structures, and the contribution that each level plausibly makes to vagal control. Second, we review recent work on a class of computational models of brain function known as “predictive coding” models. We illustrate how the computational dynamics of these models, when implemented within our proposed vagal control hierarchy, can increase understanding of the relationship between vagal control and both cognitive performance and emotional/physical health. We conclude by discussing novel implications of this updated NVI model for future research.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. This disorder slowly disintegrates thinking ability and changes behaviours of patients. These patients will show some psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder and movement disorder. These symptoms are in common with some other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and mood spectrum disorder. As patients would require immediate treatment, an on-time diagnosis is critical. This study explores the use of omics data in diagnosis of schizophrenia. Transcriptome, miRNA and epigenome data are used in diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia with the aid of machine learning algorithms. As the data is in high dimension, mutual information and feature importance are independently used for selecting relevant features for the study. Selected sets of features (biomarkers) are individually used with different machine learning algorithms and their performances are compared to select the best-performing model. This study shows that the top 140 miRNA features selected using mutual information along with support vector machines give the highest accuracy (0.86 ± 0.07) in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. All reported accuracies are validated using 5-fold cross validation. They are further validated using leave one out cross validation and the accuracies are reported in the supplementary material.

AB  - For the past several decades, chemical biologists have been leveraging chemical principles for understanding biology, tackling disease, and biomanufacturing, while systems biologists have holistically applied computation and genome-scale experimental tools to the same problems. About a decade ago, the benefit of combining the philosophies of chemical biology with systems biology into systems chemical biology was advocated, with the potential to systematically understand the way small molecules affect biological systems. Recently, there has been an explosion in new technologies that permit massive expansion in the scale of biological experimentation, increase access to more diverse chemical space, and enable powerful computational interpretation of large datasets. Fueled by these rapidly increasing capabilities, systems chemical biology is now at an inflection point, poised to enter a new era of more holistic and integrated scientific discovery. Systems chemical biology is primed to reveal an integrated understanding of fundamental biology and to discover new chemical probes to comprehensively dissect and systematically understand that biology, thereby providing a path to novel strategies for discovering therapeutics, designing drug combinations, avoiding toxicity, and harnessing beneficial polypharmacology. In this Review, we examine the emergence of new capabilities driving us to this inflection point in systems chemical biology, and highlight holistic approaches and opportunities that are arising from integrating chemical biology with a systems-level understanding of the intersection of biology and chemistry.

AB  - Arndt and Hirshman (1998) used MINERVA 2 to simulate true and false recognition in DRM-style lists and found that the model was able to capture many features of the empirical data. Here, we first replicate their simulations, but using empirically structured vectors derived from Latent Semantic Analysis rather than the randomly generated vectors characteristic of MINERVA 2. We report that the model still captures the DRM effect with fewer free parameters. We then extend our analyses to true and false recognition for full sentences and metaphorical expressions. Using a simple bag-of-words representation for sentences, we find that the MINERVA 2 model captures classic sentence false recognition findings from Bransford and Frank (1971) and a more recent finding from Reid and Katz (2018a) that demonstrates false recognition of unstudied sentences that share a metaphorical but not literal theme to studied sentences. These simulations provide evidence that an instance-based memory model, when amalgamated with structured semantic representations from a distributional semantic model, can account for true and false recognition across different types of language experiences.

AB  - Local electricity markets are a promising idea to foster the efficiency and use of renewable energy at the distribution level. However, as such a new concept, how these local markets will be designed and integrated into existing market structures, and make the most profit from them, is still unclear. In this work, we propose a local market mechanism in which end-users (consumers, small producers, and prosumers) trade energy between peers. Due to possible low liquidity in the local market, the mechanism assumes that end-users fulfill their energy demands through bilateral contracts with an aggregator/retailer with access to the wholesale market. The allowed bids and offers in the local market are bounded by a feed-in tariff and an aggregator tariff guaranteeing that end-users get, at most, the expected cost without considering this market. The problem is modeled as a multi-leader single-follower bi-level optimization problem, in which the upper levels define the maximization of agent profits. In contrast, the lower level maximizes the energy traded in the local market. Due to the complexity of the matter, and lack of perfect information of end-users, we advocate the use of evolutionary computation, a branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. Throughout three different case studies considering end-users with distinct characteristics, we evaluated the performance of four different algorithms and assessed the benefits that local markets can bring to market participants. Results show that the proposed market mechanism provides overall costs improvements to market players of around 30–40% regarding a baseline where no local market is considered. However, the shift to local markets in energy procurement can affect the conventional retailer/aggregator role. Therefore, innovative business models should be devised for the successful implementation of local markets in the future.

AB  - The purpose of this review paper is to summarize the current knowledge on cell-scale mechanically-inflicted deformation-damage, which is at the frontier of cell mechanobiology and biomechanics science, specifically in the context of chronic wounds. The dynamics of the mechanostructure of cells and particularly, the damage occurring to the cytoskeleton and plasma-membrane when cells are chronically deformed (as in a weight-bearing static posture) is correlated to formation of the most common chronic wounds and injuries, such as pressure ulcers (injuries). The first occurrence is microscopic injury which onsets as damage in individual cells and then progresses macroscopically to the tissue-scale. Here, we specifically focus on sub-catastrophic and catastrophic damage to cells that can result from mechanical loads that are delivered statically or at physiological rates; this results in apoptosis at prolonged times or necrosis, rapidly. We start by providing a basic background of cell mechanics and dynamics, focusing on the plasma-membrane and the cytoskeleton, and discuss approaches to apply and estimate deformations in cells. We then consider the effects of different levels of mechanical loads, i.e. low, high and intermediate, and describe the expected damage in terms of time-scales of application and in terms of cell response, providing experimental examples where available. Finally, we review different theoretical and computational modeling approaches that have been used to describe cell responses to sustained deformation. We highlight the insights that those models provide to explain, for example, experimentally observed variabilities in cell damage and death under loading.

AB  - Ultra-high integration, ultra-high resolution, intelligence and human-machine interaction is the inevitable trend of flat panel displays. However, most intelligent display systems are based on traditional Von Neumann architecture, which need to call data frequently because the storage and computation are separated, resulting in serious loss of power consumption and speed. In this paper, the concept of "neuromorphic display" device is proposed for the first time. The display technology is organically combined with the artificial neural network system to build a neuromorphic display network including the sensor module, processing module and display module, which endows the tiny artificial neural network system with the ability of perception, dispose and execution. The neuromorphic display enable to avoid serious loss of power consumption and speed without calling data frequently, and the color of the emitted light directly represents the result of neuromorphic display’s perception and processing of various external environment haptic stimuli. Furthermore, the neuromorphic element is applied in display that one-transistor one-synaptic transistor (1T1S) pixel circuit is demonstrated to replace two-transistor one-capacitance (2T1C) pixel circuit in traditional display to simplify pixel circuit. Therefore, the neuromorphic display showed great potentials in interactive input/control devices, intelligent wallpaper, robots and medical/health monitoring devices, and the 1T1S pixel circuit can simplify circuit design for active matrix display.

AB  - We consider Bayesian inference techniques for agent-based (AB) models, as an alternative to simulated minimum distance (SMD). Three computationally heavy steps are involved: (i) simulating the model, (ii) estimating the likelihood and (iii) sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Computational complexity of AB models implies that efficient techniques have to be used with respect to points (ii) and (iii), possibly involving approximations. We first discuss non-parametric (kernel density) estimation of the likelihood, coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We then turn to parametric approximations of the likelihood, which can be derived by observing the distribution of the simulation outcomes around the statistical equilibria, or by assuming a specific form for the distribution of external deviations in the data. Finally, we introduce Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques for likelihood-free estimation. These allow embedding SMD methods in a Bayesian framework, and are particularly suited when robust estimation is needed. These techniques are first tested in a simple price discovery model with one parameter, and then employed to estimate the behavioural macroeconomic model of De Grauwe (2012), with nine unknown parameters.

AB  - In the era of the social web, microblogging is a popular social media that enables users to share their feelings, ideas, and comments about everyday-life events, trends, and advertisements. Great emphasis has been placed on the investigation of human behavior in social networks by analyzing user-generated content to capture feelings and emotions from natural language. Delving into human reactions to events from the social message streams allows understanding collective moods and preferences of web users and supporting market strategies as well as political consensus analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach to the emotion-based classification of microblogging messages such as Twitter. The classification method is unsupervised and exploits the well-known fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, proposing an enhanced version called entropy weighted FCM (shortly, EwFCM) that overcomes the main drawback of the FCM, viz., the sensitivity to the random cluster initialization by leveraging a fuzzy measure to evaluate the entropy in the data distribution. The fuzzy entropy measure allows minimizing the fuzziness of clustering, speeding up the convergence of the clustering algorithm. The proposed approach aims at analyzing microblogging-based trends to detect the main emotions expressed in the textual content, according to a well-known computational analysis of emotions whose main models are attributable to Ekman and Plutchik. The experiments reveal that the presented approach offers high accuracy in the emotion-based classification of textual resources; comparisons with the FCM algorithm applied for emotion classification show that the proposed method converges faster and provides promising classification performance, as evaluated by common metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score.

AB  - Flaky tests (tests with non-deterministic outcomes) pose a major challenge for software testing. They are known to cause significant issues, such as reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of testing and delaying software releases. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in flaky tests, with research focusing on different aspects of flakiness, such as identifying causes, detection methods and mitigation strategies. Test flakiness has also become a key discussion point for practitioners (in blog posts, technical magazines, etc.) as the impact of flaky tests is felt across the industry. This paper presents a multivocal review that investigates how flaky tests, as a topic, have been addressed in both research and practice. Out of 560 articles we reviewed, we identified and analysed a total of 200 articles that are focused on flaky tests (composed of 109 academic and 91 grey literature articles/posts) and structured the body of relevant research and knowledge using four different dimensions: causes, detection, impact and responses. For each of those dimensions, we provide categorization and classify existing research, discussions, methods and tools With this, we provide a comprehensive and current snapshot of existing thinking on test flakiness, covering both academic views and industrial practices, and identify limitations and opportunities for future research.

AB  - This article discusses new developments in the field of literary theory and literary praxis in the era of new media from the perspectives of media theory and interology. It takes new media as a McLuhanesque formal cause and holds that a conspicuous characteristic of literary works in the era of new media lies in the salience and normalization of interality. This development means art forms like mosaic and Pointillism have acquired a paradigmatic significance as a result. In revealing this new paradigm, the article also points to some current social maladies that have come with new media. It holds that literary writing should go beyond the mere embodiment of symptoms and make an intervention in media-induced maladies. The article affirms the irreplaceability of experimental literature and serious literature in an era of attention deficit, and points out that form should occupy a paramount position in literary theory, literary criticism, and literary praxis.

AB  - This study took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when most schools worldwide were making the transition to online teaching and learning. Through this single-case study design, the study examined the learning experiences of a group of teachers engaged in interactive, inquiry-based professional learning focused on math, making and coding during a shift to emergency remote teaching. The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions. This research suggests that online professional learning sessions need to consider three elements: the teacher, the content, and the learning environment and offers important recommendations for future work in this area.

AB  - The development and application of systems strategies to biology and disease are transforming medical research and clinical practice in an unprecedented rate. In the foreseeable future, clinicians, medical researchers, and ultimately the consumers and patients will be increasingly equipped with a deluge of personal health information, e.g., whole genome sequences, molecular profiling of diseased tissues, and periodic multi-analyte blood testing of biomarker panels for disease and wellness. The convergence of these practices will enable accurate prediction of disease susceptibility and early diagnosis for actionable preventive schema and personalized treatment regimes tailored to each individual. It will also entail proactive participation from all major stakeholders in the health care system. We are at the dawn of predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory (P4) medicine, the fully implementation of which requires marrying basic and clinical researches through advanced systems thinking and the employment of high-throughput technologies in genomics, proteomics, nanofluidics, single-cell analysis, and computation strategies in a highly-orchestrated discipline we termed translational systems medicine.

AB  - Article reviews play a pivotal role in fostering students’ critical evaluation and critical thinking skills. News & Views (N&V) articles published in Nature journals are one prominent example of article reviews and serve as excellent models for students to learn and refine their skills in writing article reviews. However, there is limited research on the rhetorical features of N&V articles, especially in terms of textual organization across different disciplines. To address this gap, three corpora were compiled for the present study, representing the disciplinary groups of natural sciences (NS), social sciences (SS), and technology and engineering (TE). Each corpus was comprised of 30 N&V texts from its respective disciplinary group. Using a self-developed coding framework building on previous research, we coded the move and step of each text in the corpora. The coding data were compared and analyzed to uncover the distinguishing textual features of the three disciplinary groups. The analysis revealed that the variations were predominantly at the step level. N&V articles of NS and SS shared most of the moves and steps, but N&Vs in TE exhibited unique stylistic characteristics. These findings hold significant implications for training and teaching article review writing, particularly in relation to disciplinary contexts.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an improved atmospheric scattering model (IASM) to overcome the inherent limitation of the traditional atmospheric scattering model. Based on the IASM, a fast single image dehazing algorithm is also presented. In this algorithm, by constructing a linear model between the transmission and the haze aware density feature, the transmission map can be directly estimated through a linear operation on three components: luminance, saturation and gradient. Combining the sky-relevant feature and the proposed guided energy model (GEM), we can accurately estimate the atmospheric light and scene incident light, and can further restore the scene albedo via the IASM. Finally, an accelerating framework (AF) based on the Gaussian–Laplacian pyramid is proposed to increase the computational speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms most of the prevalent algorithms in terms of visual effect and computational efficiency. Besides, it is also capable of processing various types of degraded images in addition to hazy images.

AB  - Semantic segmentation has achieved great success with the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the huge computational burden restricts the application of most existing networks on edge devices with strict inference time constraints. To solve this problem, a weighted factorized-depthwise convolution network (WFDCNet) is presented in this paper, which contains full- dimensional continuous separation convolution (FCS) modules and a lateral asymmetric pyramid fusion (LAPF) module, aiming to obtain high accuracy without damaging inference speed. Specifically, the FCS module enables the calculation of each dimension to be completed independently in a continuous separation process and uses simplified SE (SSE) attention layer to adjust the channels, achieving the extensive extraction of feature information. The LAPF module is able to eliminate semantic divergence and fuse feature maps of three different scales to realize the combination of multiple information from the front-end and the back-end network. WFDCNet shows superior performance on Cityscapes, Camvid, Mapillary Vistas and COCO-Stuff datasets. Especially, the experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves 73.7% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset, with the inference speed of 102.6FPS on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU, and 17.2FPS on Jetson TX2.

AB  - Predictive processing has become a popular framework in neuroscience and computational psychiatry, where it has provided a new understanding of various mental disorders. Here, we apply the predictive processing account to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We argue that the experience of a traumatic event in Bayesian terms can be understood as a perceptual hypothesis that is subsequently given a very high a-priori likelihood due to its (life-) threatening significance; thus, this hypothesis is re-selected although it does not fit the actual sensory input. Based on this account, we re-conceptualise the symptom clusters of PTSD through the lens of a predictive processing model. We particularly focus on re-experiencing symptoms as the hallmark symptoms of PTSD, and discuss the occurrence of flashbacks in terms of perceptual and interoceptive inference. This account provides not only a new understanding of the clinical profile of PTSD, but also a unifying framework for the corresponding pathologies at the neurobiological level. Finally, we derive directions for future research and discuss implications for psychological and pharmacological interventions.

AB  - Brain is the most important, astonishing and complicated part of human body which is responsible for controlling and functioning of all other human organs. The physical movements and thinking capability (Cognition) of humans depend on the brain activity. Based on certain changes that occur within the brain, electric fields will be generated within the brain. Analyzing brain signals plays vital role in diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. Brain signals are obtained from electrodes of Electroencephalogram (EEG) or Magneto encephalogram (EMG). These are linear mixture of evoked potentials (EVP) of large number of neurons due to variations in conductive and geometric properties in the layers of 3 layer head model or 4 layer head model. Earlier work1-5 considered processing these mixed signals for analyzing brain functioning of brain disabled patients. But working on the source signals gives an authoritative result. Hence there is a need to separate the source signals from the measured (electrode) signals. This work will suggest a suitable approach in extracting source signals of disabled patients while they were used as subjects under experiment of retrieving event related potentials (ERP). This work retrieved the signals of non target trails i.e., non event related potentials (NERP) and extracted original source signals by the best Gaussian estimate and the algorithm proposed.

Although the accident was formally investigated, the role of the situation awareness (SA) factor, i.e., a correct understanding of the situation, and appropriate models to maintain SA, remain unexplained. This paper extracts details of abnormal situations within the methomyl unit and models them into a situational network using dynamic Bayesian networks. A fuzzy logic system is used to resemble the operator’s thinking when confronted with these abnormal situations. The combined situational network and fuzzy logic system make it possible for the operator to assess such situations dynamically to achieve accurate SA. The findings show that the proposed structure provides a useful graphical model that facilitates the inclusion of prior background knowledge and the updating of this knowledge when new information is available from monitoring systems.

Building from the insights established in the preceding chapters, and with an eye to emerging trends and challenges of rapidly evolving AI technologies, this chapter connects across the themes of ethics, technology, and design to outline the key take-aways of the book. It argues that smart city initiatives and urban technology projects do not always have to be large-scale, costly, and invisible, and that deprioritizing the smart city's central logic of scalability can help bring the materiality, specificity, and lived experience of local contexts into view. To rethink the responsible design of urban technology, the chapter concludes by advocating for a smart future that normalizes and scaffolds ethical reasoning skills in design education towards cultivating practical wisdom to carry into professional contexts and to enable a doing of ethics by design.

AB  - In argumentation teaching, providing timely and high-quality feedback is always a challenging task for teachers because of the high complexity and large volume of students’ argumentation contents. ChatGPT, a large language model introduced in November 2022, offers a potential solution for this problem. To examine the potential reliability and credibility of leveraging ChatGPT for argumentation feedback, the study conducted a retrospective analysis by applying ChatGPT to generate feedback on 50 sets of argumentation contents that human teachers had previously assessed. The study first assessed the feedback accuracy of ChatGPT and the factors that influenced the evaluation of arguments. The findings showed that ChatGPT demonstrated impressive precision rate (91.8 %) and recall rate (63.2 %) when providing feedback on arguments, indicating that ChatGPT possesses a fundamental capability to provide feedback on arguments. However, this capability of ChatGPT was significantly affected by the length of arguments and the discourse markers used in the arguments. The study then qualitatively compared the ChatGPT's feedback and teacher's feedback. The results revealed that these two types of feedback each had their own advantages and disadvantages. While ChatGPT could potentially generate comprehensive feedback and textual-based feedback, and limited to the linguistic level when provide affective feedback, teacher's feedback was more focused on student's overall learning progress, based on personal teaching experience to correctly identify immediate critical problem of the student, and consideration on the humanistic empathy interaction. Although the overall findings suggested that ChatGPT exhibited potential reliability and credibility for argumentation feedback, the study did identify several limitations.

In this chapter, a discussion is presented on exploiting the advantages presented by machine learning algorithms for fuel formulation. The present fuel modeling scenario and a holistic approach necessary for fuel optimization is first presented. A wealth of AI algorithms are available to make use of in fuel formulation. These algorithms are discussed in line with their application to fuel formulation and the literature of the explored space in this area is presented. Additionally, a discussion is presented on how AI also helps in assisting the traditional computational fluid dynamic and chemical kinetic analysis for an elaborate study of fuels. Fuel development is just a step in the entire engine innovation cycle, and a perspective of how the AI fits in to this scenario is presented.

AB  - The developmental course in the distance–speed–time domain is still a matter of debate. Traditional stage models are contested by theories of continuous development and adaptive thinking. In the present work, we introduce a formal framework for modelling the developmental course in this domain, grounding on Competence-based Knowledge Space Theory. This framework, as a more general case, widely includes assumptions and facets of previous models and covers empirical findings collected based on different experimental paradigms. By a distinction of latent competences and observable performance, model validation is not bound to a certain experimental paradigm and no one-to-one correspondence between competences and tasks is required. Therefore, the framework has the potential to bridge the gap between stage models and models of continuous development. The approach also precisely defines misconceptions, for example overgeneralization, and empirically investigates their occurrence. In the present work, we established a prototypical model for the development of understanding the distance–speed–time system. We extended this model with definitions based on different perspectives of overgeneralization. The assumptions of the model and its extensions were examined on the basis of the results of two empirical investigations using six judgment task types. The results yielded a reasonably good fit of model and data. No evidence was found for the occurrence of overgeneralization in this domain. The theoretical model and empirical results are discussed with respect to their relationship to other developmental models and theories.

AB  - The role of dopamine neurons in value-guided behavior has been described in computationally explicit terms. These developments have motivated new model-based probes of reward processing in healthy humans, and in recent years these same models have also been used to design and understand neural responses during simple social exchange. These latter applications have opened up the possibility of identifying new endophenotypes characteristic of biological substrates underlying psychiatric disease. In this report, we review model-based approaches to functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy individuals and the application of these paradigms to psychiatric disorders. We show early results from the application of model-based human interaction at three disparate levels: 1) interaction with a single human, 2) interaction within small groups, and 3) interaction with signals generated by large groups. In each case, we show how reward-prediction circuitry is engaged by abstract elements of each paradigm with blood oxygen level–dependent imaging as a read-out; and, in the last case (i.e., signals generated by large groups) we report on direct electrochemical dopamine measurements during decision making in humans. Lastly, we discuss how computational approaches can be used to objectively assess and quantify elements of complex and hidden social decision-making processes.

AB  - Text-based data sources like narratives and stories have become increasingly popular as critical insight generator in energy research and social science. However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify theoretical compatibility through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy, narratives and computational social science. Furthermore, we establish a proof-of-concept using a narrative-based case study on energy externalities in slum rehabilitation housing in Mumbai, India. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.

AB  - How the brain uses reinforcement feedback to make simple choices that lead to reward is well understood. However, this ability is often considered insufficient to account for the flexibility and efficiency of human decision-making. In this chapter, we show that the computations of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can in fact account for complex human learning abilities, such as generalization, transfer, and fast learning in high-dimensional, dynamic environments. Specifically, we show that humans structure their current information and choices into useful state and action spaces and that applying simple RL computations to these spaces—sometimes hierarchically—enables rich decision-making. Thus, RL computations enable humans to learn to represent the information they acquire in structured ways. Such structured RL simplifies complex problems (through representation learning), affords transfer of information (by building abstract rules and relating them to relevant contexts), and enables efficient exploration (by grouping together subsequences or identifying subpolicies).

AB  - Coulson et al. [1] proposed methodology for the estimation of the P and S terms used in glass interpretation when assessing the value of the findings given activity level propositions. These terms arise in a model proposed by Evett [2], Evett and Buckleton [3], and are based on survey data. Specifically they proposed a model for estimating Pk, k = 0, 1, 2, … and Sn, n = 1, 2, where Pk is the probability of finding k distinct sources (or groups) of glass on a person of interest (POI), and Sn is the probability that the kth source consists of n fragments. In this article we make a number of extensions to the work of Coulson et al. [1]. Firstly we derive an estimate of the uncertainty in the parameter of the Coulson et al. model, and show how this may be used—for example, to compute an estimate of how the probabilities may vary or how to compare estimates resulting from different surveys. Secondly, we extend the model by allowing a more sensible modelling of the “excess” zeros (in the case of the P terms) and excess ones (in the case of the S terms). The methodology used to make these extensions relies on purely frequentist theory of estimation in keeping with the original work. A Bayesian approach to estimation will be the subject of future work. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of an R (R Core Team, [4]) package, called fitPS (Curran, [5]) which makes the methodology described in this article easy to implement in practice.

AB  - Computational chemistry has become a widely used tool in nearly all subdisciplines of chemistry. Therefore, it is essential that students be exposed to these techniques throughout the undergraduate curriculum. In this work, we present a biomacromolecular docking laboratory exercise aimed at introducing computational physical chemistry in the context of protein-ligand binding to first-semester freshmen introductory chemistry students. The exercise focuses on investigating the binding properties of persistent organic pollutants, in particular, bisphenol A and its metabolite bisphenol-A glucuronide to estrogen receptors. This report gives a description of the exercise, its goals, and the software tools that were used to implement the laboratory activities. Importantly, all aspects of the exercise can be accomplished using freely accessible software and web servers. The success of the exercise was assessed using pre- and posttesting of conceptual and factual content and Likert scale student attitudinal surveys.

AB  - In our traditional impression of chemical laboratories, researchers wear white coats and safety goggles to conduct experiments. However, many recent developments in the field make use of autonomous synthesis robots with integrated artificial intelligence (AI)-driven machine-learning units. These benchtop devices might outperform human chemists in terms of speed and accuracy, which could accelerate the discovery of molecules and materials for various applications. In this Voices piece, we ask a panel of experts from institutes in China: How are AI and automation shaping the future of chemistry?

AB  - Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), implemented through self-driving laboratories (SDLs), are rapidly creating unprecedented opportunities for the accelerated discovery and optimization of materials. This paper provides a joint analysis of SDLs from both academic and industry perspectives, highlighting the importance of integrating human intelligence in these systems. It discusses the necessity of careful planning in SDL design across physical, data, and workflow dimensions, including instrumental setup, experimental workflow, data management, and human–SDL interaction. The significance of integrating human input within SDLs, especially as the focus shifts from individual tools and tasks to the creation and management of complex workflows, is emphasized. The paper stresses on the crucial role of reward function design in developing forward-looking workflows and examines the interplay between hardware evolution, ML application across chemical processes, and the influence of reward systems in research. Ultimately, the article advocates for a future where SDLs blend human intuition in hypothesis formulation with AI's precision, speed, and data-handling capabilities.

AB  - Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork skills in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organise their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimised. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin’s role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student’s predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.

AB  - Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit higher levels of rumination, i.e., repetitive thinking patterns and exaggerated focus on negative states. Rumination is known to be associated with the cortical midline structures / default mode network (DMN) region activity, although the brain network topological organization underlying rumination remains unclear. Implementing a graph theoretical analysis based on ultra-high field 7-Tesla functional MRI data, we tested whether whole brain network connectivity hierarchies during resting state are associated with rumination in a dimensional manner across 20 patients with MDD and 20 healthy controls. Applying this data-driven approach we found a significant correlation between rumination tendency and connectivity strength degree of the right precuneus, a key node of the DMN. In order to interrogate this region further, we then applied the Dependency Network Analysis (DEPNA), a recently developed method used to quantify the connectivity influence of network nodes. This revealed that rumination was associated with lower connectivity influence of the left medial orbito-frontal cortex (MOFC) cortex on the right precuneus. Lastly, we used an information theory entropy measure that quantifies the cohesion of a network's correlation matrix. We show that subjects with higher rumination scores exhibit higher entropy levels within the DMN i.e. decreased overall connectivity within the DMN. These results emphasize the general DMN involvement during self-reflective processing related to maladaptive rumination in MDD. This work specifically highlights the impact of the MOFC on the precuneus, which might serve as a target for clinical neuromodulation treatment.

AB  - Designers constantly and consistently draft and develop both general concepts and directions to identify the solution that best fits the styling objectives of the lead designer. Designers often confront design fixations that cognitively clash to explore different design combinations. As design teams explore the range of possible design spaces of a certain design strategy, there is an opportunity for computational approaches to improve the styling process. By implementing product appearance similarity and styling strategy in computational design synthesis, it is possible to discover combinations that would otherwise remain unexplored by human designers. Numerous studies on design synthesis have been conducted. However, there has been no focus on the morphological synthesis of designs with strategic styling decisions. Considering this, the proposed study develops a method to synthesize car styling based on product appearance similarity for effective design exploration in the concept generation phase. The similarities of products across different generations, product portfolios, and competitors’ products are calculated to evaluate the strategic styling decision. The results of the strategic styling decision are used to formulate a fitness function. Car styling is then synthesized with a genetic algorithm based on this fitness function to generate car styling in accordance with the target strategic styling decision. In this respect, designers can computationally synthesize novel design alternatives that consider both homogeneity (family look in design) and heterogeneity (design trend in the market) by pinpointing the desired design exploration area. Ultimately, the style synthesis methodology proposed in this research can help designers to utilize the gradual visualization of styling strategies for more effective and efficient managerial design decisions. To do this, we conduct five major tasks: first, car design data are collected for design synthesis; second, the product appearance similarity is calculated to measure the strategic styling decision; third, synthesis validation is conducted to test whether the proposed methodology can create outside-the-box designs; fourth, a genetic algorithm is used to synthesize car designs in consideration of the strategic styling decision; finally, a series of in-depth interviews with experts and validation experiments are conducted with in-house automobile designers to examine the impact of the proposed methodology. The results showed that designers can quantitatively measure and compare the styling strategies of each car brand, then implement design upgrades, while still maintaining that specific style. Correspondingly, computationally generated design alternatives improve the satisfaction in ease, time, objective reflection and novelty of design outcomes when formulating design strategies in the concept generation phase.

AB  - In the marketing learning, practical training courses are very important for undergraduates to understand and master theoretical knowledge. Virtual reality (VR) technology has great potential in practical teaching, but its effect on marketing students has not been paid enough attention. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring the impact of immersive VR practical training courses on marketing learning. By using the self-developed “immersive VR supermarket design” system as a platform, this study qualitatively analyzed the evaluations of marketing students who participated in this VR practical training course. The results show that students have perceived novelty, perceived interest, the sense of achievement and perceived usefulness of the VR practical training course, which can enhance their professional identity and thus enhance their willingness to learn. In addition, perceived usefulness includes professional cognition improvement, professional knowledge deepening, practical ability improvement, VR knowledge improvement and team cooperation ability improvement. The conclusions show that it is a positive thing to introduce immersive VR into marketing practical training courses. This study enriches the research of immersive VR practical courses and provides significant implications for the development of VR practical training courses in marketing education.

AB  - Identification of vulnerabilities of water distribution systems and identification of appropriate counter-measures are important components of homeland security. These are difficult and time consuming tasks. This paper provides a new approach to resolve these problems in complex infrastructure systems. It is based on the use of co-evolutionary computation for the generation of both terrorist and security scenarios. The basic concepts of co-evolutionary computation are briefly explained. The concept of co-evolutionary generation of terrorist and security scenarios is introduced in the context of a hypothetical water distribution system for a small town. A tool developed at George Mason University is used for a number of experiments that reveal a variety of emerging security patterns. The experiments show that these patterns may be helpful in effectively protecting the network.

AB  - Scientific research is constrained by limited resources, so it is imperative that it be conducted efficiently. This paper introduces the notion of epistemic expression, a kind of representation that expedites the solution of research problems. Epistemic expressions are representations that (i) contain information in a way that enables more reliable information to place the most stringent constraints on possible solutions and (ii) make new information readily extractible by biasing the search through that space. I illustrate these conditions using historical and contemporary examples of biomolecular structure determination. Then, I argue that the notion of epistemic expression parts ways with pragmatic accounts of scientific representation and an understanding of models as artifacts, neither of which require models to accurately represent. Explicating epistemic expression thus fills a gap in our understanding of scientific practice, extending Morrison and Morgan's (1999) conception of models as investigative instruments.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The state-of-the-art of mobility services among large-scale agent-based travel demand models has focused predominantly on the demand side, whereas complexities of the supply side have been given much less attention. Conventional definitions must be revisited to establish solid foundations for model implementations. First, several mobility services are characterized from abstract attributes, by all agents involved, and by operational tasks involved in service provision. Then, a high-level generic service provision process is developed to allow instantiation of various services. Extensions for conventional travel demand model systems are also developed, including: a mobility services component containing service provider agentsand their operational tasks integrated logically into service provision processes; a fleet component containing vehicle agents of each service and a driver activity model when human-driven; a MaaS component containing mobility provider agents that coordinate and integrate mobility services. Generic modeling issues are also discussed, including treatment of time, data structures, and computational efficiency.

AB  - This paper reviews biophysical models of psychotherapeutic change based on synergetics and the free energy principle. These models suggest that introducing sensory surprise into the patient-therapist system can lead to self-organization and the formation of new attractor states, disrupting entrenched patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. We propose that the therapist can facilitate this process by cultivating epistemic trust and modulating embodied attention to allow surprising affective states to enter shared awareness. Transient increases in free energy enable the update of generative models, expanding the range of experiences available within the patient-therapist phenomenal field. We hypothesize that patterns of disorganization at behavioural and physiological levels, indexed by increased entropy, complexity, and lower determinism, are key markers and predictors of psychotherapeutic gains. Future research should investigate how the therapist's openness to novelty shapes therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents a potential approach to settle the problem of surviving major safety accidents in Submerged Floating Tunnel (SFT) that detachable emergency escape devices are set up outside SFT. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology is used to investigate the effect of emergency escape devices on the hydrodynamic load acting on SFT in uniform and oscillatory flows and water waves by numerical test. The governing equations, i.e., the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and k – ɛ standard turbulence equations, are solved by the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Analytic solutions for the Airy wave are applied to set boundary conditions to generate water wave. The VOF method is used to trace the free surface. In uniform flow, hydrodynamic loads, applied to SFT with emergency escape device, reduce obviously. But, in oscillatory flow, it has little influence on hydrodynamic loads acting on SFT. Horizontal and vertical wave loads of SFT magnify to some extend due to emergency escape devices so that the influence of emergency escape devices on hydrodynamic loads of SFT should be taken into consideration when designed.

AB  - The world is witnessing the impact of deadly disease outbreaks in the form of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the beginning of the 21st century, we have witnessed several other disease outbreaks (e.g., SARS, H1N1, Zika virus disease, and Ebola virus epidemics), which have significantly affected our healthcare systems and socioeconomic profile. To fight against these disease outbreaks, the research and development (R&D) sectors are continuously working to develop putative therapeutic modules across the globe. In this context, computational tools further corroborated the drug design and development process. The in silico approaches particularly molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation received considerable attention in identifying putative drug candidates and thus critically revolutionized the drug development pipelines. As compared to classical pharmacology-based approaches, the reverse pharmacology-based approaches in combination with high throughput computational tools (computer-aided drug designing, quantitative structure–activity relationship studies) have transformed the drug screening timeline thereby minimizing the manpower, cost, and drug development process by 50%–60%. The concept of drug repurposing, that is, utilizing old and clinically-approved drug molecules become a household proposition in R&D sectors by minimizing the drug development cost and timelines. In this review, we emphasized the role of computational-based approaches particularly molecular docking and simulations in designing novel drug candidates to mitigate potential health hazards associated with SARS-CoV-2. Apart from this, we have also emphasized the translational research pipelines being developed to translate the in silico data into the market for human consumption.

AB  - Most of the past research on the problem of deadlock avoidance for sequential complex resource allocation systems (RAS) has acknowledged the fact that the maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) possesses super-polynomial complexity for most RAS classes, and it has resorted to solutions that trade off maximal permissiveness for computational tractability. In this work, we seek the effective implementation of the maximally permissive DAP for a broad spectrum of RAS, by distinguishing between the off-line and the on-line computation that is required for the specification of this policy, and developing a representation of the derived result that will require minimal on-line computation. The particular representation that we adopt is that of a compact classifier that will effect the underlying dichotomy of the reachable state space into safe and unsafe subspaces. Through a series of reductions of the posed classification problem, we are also able to attain extensive reductions in the computational complexity of the off-line task of the construction of the sought classifier. A series of computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and establish its ability to provide tractable implementations of the maximally permissive DAP for problem instances significantly beyond the capacity of any other approach currently available in the literature.

AB  - Consider object exchange problems when each agent may be endowed with and consume more than one object. For most domains of preferences, no rule satisfies efficiency, the endowment lower bound, and strategy-proofness. Insisting on the first two properties, we explore the extent to which weaker incentive compatibility can be achieved. Motivated by behavioral and computational considerations as well as online mechanisms, we define several forms of manipulation. We consider the lexicographic domain of preferences, and provide several characterizations of Generalized Top Trading Cycles based on properties concerning immunity from heuristic and identity-splitting manipulations. We also show that this establishes a boundary with respect to incentive compatibility—minimal strengthening results in impossibility.

They also discuss means by which curriculum and instruction in science education can be tied to these issues. The chapter reviews opportunities and challenges presented to individuals by the expectations of participatory health care, focusing on models of health literacy that can help understand and address the challenges. The authors argue that the problem of ensuring effective information use often lies in a transmission approach to health information provision. Transmitted knowledge is often not understood nor applied, as demonstrated in studies of human papillomavirus vaccination education. An alternative to knowledge transmission is the approach that aims to foster critical literacy, which is grounded in critical thinking essential to the practice of science. The chapter reviews a number of interdisciplinary science education activities that introduce health issues in the context of biology, physics, and chemistry education, ensuring deep understanding needed for developing critical literacy. It also discusses science education approaches and theories that encourage the development of deep, culturally meaningful science knowledge. Finally, the chapter reviews professional development and the role of various professionals, including teachers and librarians, in the collaborative endeavor of effective health information provision.

In this chapter, we take bold step and propose the unthinkable: The genesis of a Customizable Mind-Machine. Thought that stems from the mind is deeply seated in a biological framework of neurons. The biological origin lies in the marvel of evolution over the eons and refined ever so fast, faster than in the prior centuries. Three (a, b, and c), triadic objects are ceaselessly at work. At a personal level (a) mind, knowledge, and machines have been intertwined like inspiration, words, and language since the dawn of the human evolution and more recently, (b) technology, manufacturing, and economics have formed a hub of progress, (c) wealth, global marketing, and insatiable needs of humans and civilization. These triadic cycles of nine essential objects of human existence are spinning quicker and quicker every year. The Internet offers the mind no choice but to leap and soar over history and over the globe. Alternatively, human mind can sink deeper and deeper into ignorance and oblivion. More recently, the Artificial Intelligence at work in the Internet had challenged the natural intelligence at the cognizance level in the mind to find its way to breakthroughs and innovations. We integrate functions of the mind with the processing of knowledge in the hardware of machines by freely traversing the neural, mental, physical, psychological, social, knowledge, and computational spaces. The laws of neural biology and mind, laws of knowledge and social sciences, and finally the laws of physics and mechanics in each of the spaces are unique and executed by distinctive processors for each space. Much as mind rules over matter, the triad of mind, space, and time creates a human-space that rules over the Relativistic-space of matter, space, and time.

AB  - As a complex engineering problem, the satellite module layout design (SMLD) is difficult to resolve by using conventional computation-based approaches. The challenges stem from three aspects: computational complexity, engineering complexity, and engineering practicability. Engineers often finish successful satellite designs by way of their plenty of experience and wisdom, lessons learnt from the past practices, as well as the assistance of the advanced computational techniques. Enlightened by the ripe patterns, this article puts forward a knowledge fusion approach, which fuses online human knowledge, prior knowledge, and computational knowledge by using evolutionary computation to fully explore the advantages of human and computers. This article highlights the way to represent aforementioned three types of design knowledge, the model to describe problem and the method to fuse, and the roles human plays. The numerical experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB  - Learning is fundamental to animal survival. Animals must learn to link sensory cues in the environment to actions that lead to reward or avoid punishment. Rapid learning can then be highly adaptive and the difference between life or death. To explore the neural dynamics and circuits that underlie learning, however, has typically required the use of laboratory paradigms with tight control of stimuli, action sets, and outcomes. Learning curves in such reward-based tasks are reported as slow and gradual, with animals often taking hundreds to thousands of trials to reach expert performance. The slow, highly variable, and incremental learning curve remains the largely unchallenged belief in modern systems neuroscience. Here, we provide historical and contemporary evidence that instrumental forms of reward-learning can be dissociated into two parallel processes: knowledge acquisition which is rapid with step-like improvements, and behavioral expression which is slower and more variable. We further propose that this conceptual distinction may allow us to isolate the associative (knowledge-related) and non-associative (performance-related) components that influence learning. We then discuss the implications that this revised understanding of the learning curve has for systems neuroscience.

AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms are intelligent optimization approaches that lead the searching procedure through utilizing exploitation and exploration. The increasing complexity of real-world optimization problem has prompted the development of more metaheuristic algorithms. Hence, this work proposes a novel swarm intelligence algorithm, Walrus optimizer (WO). It is inspired by the behaviors of walruses that choose to migrate, breed, roost, feed, gather and escape by receiving key signals (danger signals and safety signals). To test the capability of the proposed algorithm, 23 standard functions and the benchmark suite from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2021 are used. In addition, to evaluate the practicability of the proposed algorithm to solve various real-world optimization problems, 6 standard classical engineering optimization problems are examined and compared. For statistical purposes, 100 independent optimization runs are conducted to determine the statistical measurements, including the mean, standard deviation, and the computation time of the program, by considering a predefined stopping criterion. Some well-known statistical analyses are also used for comparative purposes, including the Friedman and Wilcoxon analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide special stability features and very competitive performance in dealing with high-dimensional benchmarks and real-world problems. The proposal of WO promotes the continuous development and application expansion of artificial intelligence, improves the efficiency of optimization calculation, and provides powerful tools for solving complex problems in the real world. The source code of WO is publicly availabe at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/154702-walrus-optimizer-wo.

This paper describes and summarizes the five key questions of human performance modeling: 1) Why we build models of human performance; 2) What the expectations of a good human performance model are; 3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are; 4) How we integrate a human performance model with system design; and 5) What the possible future directions of human performance modeling research are. Recent and classic HPM findings are addressed in the five questions to provide new thinking in HPM's motivations, expectations, procedures, system integration and future directions.

AB  - High-speed trains are very fast (e.g. 350km/h) and operate at high traffic density, so once a fault has occurred, the consequences are disastrous. In order to better control the train operational status by timely and rapid detection of faults, we need new methods to handle and analyze the huge volumes of high-speed railway data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and platform for high-speed train fault diagnosis based on big data technologies. The framework aims to allow researchers to focus on fault detection algorithm development and on-line application, with all the complexities of big data import, storage, management, and realtime use handled transparently by the framework. The framework uses a combination of cloud computing and edge computing and a two-level architecture that handles the massive data of train operations. The platform uses Hadoop as its basic framework and combines HDFS, HBase, Redis and MySQL database as the data storage framework. A lossless data compression method is presented to reduce the data storage space and improve data storage efficiency. In order to support various types of data analysis tasks for fault diagnosis and prognosis, the framework integrates online computation, off-line computation, stream computation, real-time computation and so on. Moreover, the platform provides fault diagnosis and prognosis as services to users and a simple case study is given to further illustrate how the basic functions of the platform are implemented.

Besides the principle itself, there have been a lot of studies about the field synergy including computational approaches and experimental means to demonstrate and apply this principle. However, an opposite research direction: “ non-synergy” – how can we obtain worst convection result – is also worth researching for the theory and practice. Until now detailed studies have hardly been published in the open literatures. In this paper, a basic theoretical non-synergy research is presented, some algebraically explicit analytical exact solutions for the governing partial differential equation set of two-dimensional laminar incompressible full field non-synergy are derived using the extraordinary methods promoted by the authors, for example, the method of separating variables with the addition and other hybrid method. The obtained solutions include the conditions with the heat source, the mass flow source or no any sources. The physical feature of various solutions are discussed and explained by the means of figures. Besides theoretical meaning, the solutions can be benchmark solutions to develop the computational heat transfer.

AB  - The number of urban tunnels has been increasing rapidly, accompanied by frequent tunnel fire accidents owing to the complex tunnel structure and large traffic flow. In this study, a full-size tunnel virtual reality (VR) scenario and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) construction model were established to investigate the evacuation behavior and corresponding risk of people in the early stage of vehicle fires considering four scenarios: normal circumstance, without VR agents, without emergency evacuation signs, and without fire extinguishers. Firstly, the cumulative values of CO, CO2, and temperature along the evacuation path were monitored using CFD. Secondly, the smoke toxicity was calculated using the N-GAS model, and the total risk value was computed based on the analytic hierarchy process which was defined as “smoke hazard: temperature hazard = 7:3.” Thirdly, a multiple regression model was created based on accident data. Finally, to minimize accidents, the design of the evacuation path was optimized using the established mathematical model and A* algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the risk assessment model. The results show that the effects of VR agents, emergency evacuation signs, and fire extinguishers on the evacuation behavior of people are mutual influence. This study combined time and route in the VR evacuation experiments to overcome the limitations of the existing control and VR experiments in quantifying the evacuation results. This research can be utilized to improve emergency evacuation plans and emergency response decision making. Furthermore, it can broaden the application of VR in the field of tunnel lifecycle safety management.

AB  - In the absence of structural incentives that price negative externalities, renewable energies rely primarily on investors’ expectations of future performance to succeed in the marketplace. While there have been many disparate regional analyses of the prospects for clean energy, in particular wind, there is yet a cohesive framework for thinking about global interactions. Using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the article addresses three shortcomings in empirical renewable policy literature. First, the article briefly synthesizes the current state of the offshore wind literature. Second, the article develops a linear programming model to assess the relative prospects of offshore wind energy throughout seven world regions: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) North America, OECD Europe, OECD Asia and Eurasia, Non-OECD Europe and Eurasia, Non-OECD Asia, Africa, and Central & South America. Third, the article applies the Interactive Agency Model (IAM) as a systems-level framework for thinking about offshore wind development in the presence of social, economic, and institutional attributes. Results suggest that OECD Asia and Eurasia, OECD Europe, and non-OECD Europe and Eurasia, respectively, have the highest potential for offshore wind sector performance. Despite simplifying assumptions, this article presents one of the first evaluations of global offshore wind energy potential for policymakers and industry to consider in crafting future renewable energy investment decisions.

AB  - Recently, our understanding of the structural basis of troponin-tropomyosin’s Ca2+-triggered regulation of striated muscle contraction has advanced greatly, particularly via cryo-electron microscopy data. Compelling atomic models of troponin-tropomyosin-actin were published for both apo- and Ca2+-saturated states of the cardiac thin filament. Subsequent electron microscopy and computational analyses have supported and further elaborated the findings. Per cryo-electron microscopy, each troponin is highly extended and contacts both tropomyosin strands, which lie on opposite sides of the actin filament. In the apo-state characteristic of relaxed muscle, troponin and tropomyosin hinder strong myosin-actin binding in several different ways, apparently barricading the actin more substantially than does tropomyosin alone. The troponin core domain, the C-terminal third of TnI, and tropomyosin under the influence of a 64-residue helix of TnT located at the overlap of adjacent tropomyosins are all in positions that would hinder strong myosin binding to actin. In the Ca2+-saturated state, the TnI C-terminus dissociates from actin and binds in part to TnC; the core domain pivots significantly; the N-lobe of TnC binds specifically to actin and tropomyosin; and tropomyosin rotates partially away from myosin’s binding site on actin. At the overlap domain, Ca2+ causes much less tropomyosin movement, so a more inhibitory orientation persists. In the myosin-saturated state of the thin filament, there is a large additional shift in tropomyosin, with molecular interactions now identified between tropomyosin and both actin and myosin. A new era has arrived for investigation of the thin filament and for functional understandings that increasingly accommodate the recent structural results.

AB  - Materials chemistry is being profoundly influenced by the uptake of machine learning methodologies. Machine learning techniques, in combination with established techniques from computational physics, promise to accelerate the discovery of new materials by elucidating complex structure–property relationships from massive material databases. Despite exciting possibilities, further methodological developments call for a greater synergism between materials chemists, physicists, and engineers on one side, with computer science and math majors on the other. In this review, we provide a non-exhaustive account of machine learning in materials chemistry for computer scientists and applied mathematicians, with an emphasis on molecule datasets and materials chemistry problems. The first part of this review provides a tutorial on how to prepare such datasets for subsequent model building, with an emphasis on the construction of feature vectors. We also provide a self-contained introduction to density functional theory, a method from computational physics which is widely used to generate datasets and compute response variables. The second part reviews two machine learning methodologies which represent the status quo in materials chemistry at present – kernelized machine learning and Bayesian machine learning – and discusses their application to real datasets. In the third part of the review, we introduce some emerging machine learning techniques which have not been widely adopted by materials scientists and therefore present potential avenues for computer science and applied math majors. In the final concluding section, we discuss some recent machine learning-based approaches to real materials discovery problems and speculate on some promising future directions.

AB  - This paper makes the case for, and calls for participants in, an interdisciplinary research program exploring the development of theatrical methods of social system modeling. It combines argumentation that synthesizes concepts from the theatre and the system sciences with results from a pilot application of some of the modeling methods discussed. Theatrical methods of modeling facilitate surprising insights regarding the impacts of emotion and other non-trivial factors on system behaviour that are difficult to address in purely computational and diagrammatic forms of modeling. While a theoretical relationship between systems approaches and the theatrical techniques discussed has been articulated elsewhere, this paper is the first to propose a more fulsome exploration of the potentialities of this relationship for systems praxis.

AB  - Steroid profiling applications have a long history primarily directed toward diagnosis of endocrine disorders of childhood. Technological advances in mass spectrometry enabling rapid, sensitive, and specific measurements of multiple steroids in biological fluids are now paving the way for numerous other applications, including diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma, primary aldosteronism, and different forms of hypercortisolism. Such analytical procedures that target combinations of steroids in a single biological sample have potential for efficient one-shot methods for diagnosis of multiple disorders of steroidogenesis. Moreover, within a specific disorder, such methods can facilitate subtyping for more rapid therapeutic stratification than allowed by current methods that rely on single measurements per sample at sequential time points in a diagnostic process. Combined with advances in computational mathematics, such as machine learning, it is now possible to move from traditional unidimensional approaches for interpreting diagnostic data to methods that can interpret patterns in data. Mass spectrometry–based steroidomics provides an ideal platform for advancing such multidimensional approaches for disease diagnosis and stratification. Bottlenecks that must be overcome to move forward include needs for laboratory harmonization and method certification combined with ingrained reliance on outmoded, but well-accepted, diagnostic methods and general inertia to take advantage of new technologies.

AB  - A socially intelligent robot can analyze information, is continually aware of its social environment, and can respond in ways that are consistent with human social norms. A socially intelligent robot is one who can converse with other socially intelligent robots. It should also be able to assimilate information, think abstractly about it, generate new ideas, and automatically influence decisions in its favor. The conscious mind is required at this stage for the development of an emotional body. A feeling-capable body is required because emotions are important for distinguishing oneself from others and inspiring action. The goal was to move social robotics forward. Our research intends to develop social robots with human-like qualities. We created social robots using our own design that could converse with people more naturally. One of our ultimate goals was to create social robots with more human-like interaction abilities. The social emotional artificial intelligence (SEAI) is a mind designed specifically for sentient robots with emotions and a sense of self. The goal of the combined system was to accurately portray the users' emotional states and logical cognitive processes. Its development was largely influenced by biological research. It employs a deliberative/reactive paradigm, with a reactive paradigm handling low-level processing and control and a knowledge-based expert system handling high-level symbolic reasoning. These systems work in tandem to ensure flawless performance. Before presenting the scientific foundations of the SEAI framework and a computational formalization of those foundations, an overview of numerous cognitive systems with biological inspiration will be provided. The design is then thoroughly technical, with major parallels to the human cognitive system highlighted. This research is being conducted to assist researchers in better understanding how artificial emotions influence the robot's decisions and judgments.
