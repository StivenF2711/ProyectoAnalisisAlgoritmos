N2 - Nowadays, with rising energy prices, energy efficiency is playing an important role in all industries. Differential pressure-based measuring instruments are still widely used instruments with orifice flow meters being the most popular ones. Due to its simplicity, reliability, and ease of maintenance, orifice flow meters are very common measuring instruments in many industries. As these instruments are differential pressure-based instruments, they are increasing energy costs due to increased pressure loss. Conventional single-hole orifice (SHO) flow meters have many advantages but also some disadvantages that are affecting energy efficiency. These disadvantages like higher pressure difference, slower pressure recovery, lower discharge coefficient can be overcome by multi-hole orifice (MHO) flow meters. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to study energy consumption of both SHO and MHO with four different β parameters. Results showed MHO to be more energy efficient compared to SHO with same β parameter. These results are showing one more advantage MHO have compared to SHO, but further research is needed to make them a drop-in replacement.

N2 - The maximum wind load direction of tower crane is considered to be perpendicular to its jib. The interference effects of its different segments and across-wind loads are ignored in traditional crane safety evaluation. This study proposes a general scheme for the safety evaluation of tower cranes under fluctuating wind loads. The wind coefficients of a full-scale model of a tower crane were calculated by computational fluid dynamics, and then the time history of wind loads, simulated through the autoregressive method, were applied to the finite element model of a tower crane. The results reveal that the maximum along-wind load direction deflected 30°–60°, and the mean ratio of the absolute value of the across-wind coefficient to the along-wind coefficient of the tower crane was 8.56%, which indicated that the across-wind loads should be taken into account in wind-resistant design. Comparing the wind-induced responses of four typical wind directions, the maximum displacement, the bending stress and the axial stress of the tower crane occurred in the positive direction. Furthermore, the maximum acceleration of the cat-head was 0.028 m/s2, which met the comfort requirements of the operator. Although the tower crane met the strength and static stiffness requirements of design rules, the maximum bending stress at the junctions between the jib and the slewing platform, the counterweight and the counter-jib, exceeded the allowable stress, and the first modal of the tower crane was excited. These results warrant considering the effect of fluctuating wind loads in the safety evaluation of a tower crane.

N2 - Road spray greatly affects vehicle body soiling and driving safety. The study of road spray has attracted increasing attention. In this article, computational fluid dynamics software with widely used finite volume method code was employed to investigate the numerical simulation of spray induced by a simplified wheel model and a modified square-back model proposed by the Motor Industry Research Association. Shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model, discrete phase model, and Eulerian wall-film model were selected. In the simulation process, the phenomenon of breakup and coalescence of drops were considered, and the continuous and discrete phases were treated as two-way coupled in momentum and turbulent motion. The relationship between the vehicle external flow structure and body soiling was also discussed.

N2 - The draft genome sequence of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni), a cause of schistosomiasis, encodes a predicted guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein tagged Smp_059340.1. Smp_059340.1 is predicted to be a member of the G protein alpha-s subunit responsible for regulating adenylyl cyclase activity in S. mansoni and a possible drug target against the parasite. Our structural bioinformatics analyses identified key amino acid residues (Ser53, Thr188, Asp207 and Gly210) in the two molecular switches responsible for cycling the protein between active (GTP bound) and inactive (GDP bound) states. Residue Thr188 is located on Switch I region while Gly210 is located on Switch II region with Switch II longer than Switch I. The Asp207 is located on the G3 box motif and Ser53 is the binding residue for magnesium ion. These findings offer new insights into the dynamic and functional determinants of the Smp_059340.1 protein in regulating the S. mansoni life cycle. The binding interfaces and their residues could be used as starting points for selective modulations of interactions within the pathway using small molecules, peptides or mutagenesis.

N2 - Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 25–34 year olds and the third leading cause of death among 15–25 year olds in the United States. In the Emergency Department, where suicidal patients often present, estimating the risk of repeated attempts is generally left to clinical judgment. This paper presents our second attempt to determine the role of computational algorithms in understanding a suicidal patient’s thoughts, as represented by suicide notes. We focus on developing methods of natural language processing that distinguish between genuine and elicited suicide notes. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can categorize suicide notes as well as mental health professionals and psychiatric physician trainees do. The data used are comprised of suicide notes from 33 suicide completers and matched to 33 elicited notes from healthy control group members. Eleven mental health professionals and 31 psychiatric trainees were asked to decide if a note was genuine or elicited. Their decisions were compared to nine different machine-learning algorithms. The results indicate that trainees accurately classified notes 49% of the time, mental health professionals accurately classified notes 63% of the time, and the best machine learning algorithm accurately classified the notes 78% of the time. This is an important step in developing an evidence-based predictor of repeated suicide attempts because it shows that natural language processing can aid in distinguishing between classes of suicidal notes.

N2 - Lexis diagrams are rectangular arrays of event rates indexed by age and period. Analysis of Lexis diagrams is a cornerstone of cancer surveillance research. Typically, population-based descriptive studies analyze multiple Lexis diagrams defined by sex, tumor characteristics, race/ethnicity, geographic region, etc. Inevitably the amount of information per Lexis diminishes with increasing stratification. Several methods have been proposed to smooth observed Lexis diagrams up front to clarify salient patterns and improve summary estimates of averages, gradients, and trends. In this article, we develop a novel bivariate kernel-based smoother that incorporates two key innovations. First, for any given kernel, we calculate its singular values decomposition, and select an optimal truncation point—the number of leading singular vectors to retain—based on the bias-corrected Akaike information criterion. Second, we model-average over a panel of candidate kernels with diverse shapes and bandwidths. The truncated model averaging approach is fast, automatic, has excellent performance, and provides a variance-covariance matrix that takes model selection into account. We present an in-depth case study (invasive estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer incidence among non-Hispanic white women in the United States) and simulate operating characteristics for 20 representative cancers. The truncated model averaging approach consistently outperforms any fixed kernel. Our results support the routine use of the truncated model averaging approach in descriptive studies of cancer.

N2 - For decades, day–night patterns in behaviour have been investigated by asking people about their sleep–wake timing, their diurnal activity patterns, and their sleep duration. We demonstrate that the increasing digitalization of lifestyle offers new possibilities for research to investigate day–night patterns and related traits with the help of behavioural data. Using smartphone sensing, we collected in vivo data from 597 participants across several weeks and extracted behavioural day–night pattern indicators. Using this data, we explored three popular research topics. First, we focused on individual differences in day–night patterns by investigating whether ‘morning larks’ and ‘night owls’ manifest in smartphone–sensed behavioural indicators. Second, we examined whether personality traits are related to day–night patterns. Finally, exploring social jetlag, we investigated whether traits and work weekly day–night behaviours influence day–night patterns on weekends. Our findings highlight that behavioural data play an essential role in understanding daily routines and their relations to personality traits. We discuss how psychological research can integrate new behavioural approaches to study personality.

N2 - In order to improve the efficiency of stainless steel stamping multistage pump, quadratic regression orthogonal test, hydraulic design, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used to analyze the effect of pump geometric parameters. Sixteen impellers are designed based on the quadratic regression orthogonal test, which have three factors including impeller outlet slope, impeller blade outlet stagger angle, and impeller blade outlet width. Through quadratic regression equation, the function relationship between efficiency values and three factors is established. The optimal combination of geometric parameters is found through the analysis of the regression equation. To further study the influence of blade thickness on the performance of multistage pump, numerical simulations of multistage pump with different blade thicknesses are carried out. The influence law of blade thickness on pump performance is built from the external characteristics and internal flow field. In conclusion, with the increase of blade thickness, the best efficiency point of the pump shifts to the small flow rate direction, and the vortex regions inside the pump at rated flow gradually increase, which is the main reason that pump efficiency decreases along with the increase of the blade thickness at rated flow.

N2 - The English version of the Independent Television Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI), which was developed in 2001 to measure how involved or present participants are when experiencing different media, has substantial psychometric evidence. This study was used to translate and validate the ITC-SOPI in interactive virtual environments among the Chinese population. We used the forward-backward translation procedure. An expert panel reviewed the translated ITC-SOPI until the Chinese version of the ITC-SOPI was finalized. A total of 210 participants (133 males and 77 females), with a mean age of 23.05 years (SD = 3.56, range = 17–47), completed the Chinese ITC-SOPI. The following psychometric properties were examined: factor structure, internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed a good fit (χ2/df = 1.70, Tucker–Lewis Index [TLI] = 0.91, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.058) of the four-factor model (spatial presence, engagement, ecological validity, and negative effects). For each factor, the Chinese ITC-SOPI had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.75 to 0.87) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.82 to 0.91). Significant correlations were identified between all factors and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index-C (IRI-C) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The Chinese ITC-SOPI had good psychometric properties, suggesting that it is a reliable and valid tool for evaluating media users’ sense of presence in a Chinese-speaking context.
