N2 - Various sensors have achieved large-scale deployment as important data sources in intelligent transportation systems, and abundant data are generated and processed into useful information and new services. The means by which to make effective use of this information and these services to benefit the driver and improve road safety is very important in an intelligent transportation system. This research aims to describe the design and implementation of a context-aware service system for perceiving the driving situation and providing the most appropriate function or information services to address the actual needs in a driving assistance environment. To describe various hazardous situations, the status-emphasized context model and reasoning rules are proposed to abstract the context information and facilitate better understanding the driver’s context. The approach of customized service invocation is proposed by the retrieval of the service configuration model, which builds the relationship between the driver’s status and appropriate business services. In addition, to address the situations with multiple hazards, a priority- and severity-based invocation control algorithm is proposed; through this algorithm, the invocation procedure can be determined based on the priority and severity of the hazards. An evaluation based on computational experiments is conducted to verify the availability and validity of the service system.

N2 - With the development of modern communication, available spectrum resources are becoming increasingly scarce, which reduce network throughput. Moreover, the mobility of nodes results in the changes of network topological structure. Hence, a considerable amount of control information is consumed, which causes a corresponding increase in network power consumption and exerts a substantial impact on network lifetime. To solve the real-time transmission problem in large-scale wireless mobile sensor networks, opportunistic spectrum access is applied to adjust the transmission power of sensor nodes and the transmission velocity of data. A cognitive routing and optimization protocol based on multiple channels with a cross-layer design is proposed to study joint optimal cognitive routing with maximizing network throughput and network lifetime. Experimental results show that the cognitive routing and optimization protocol based on multiple channels achieves low computational complexity, which maximizes network throughput and network lifetime. This protocol can be also effectively applied to large-scale wireless mobile sensor networks.

N2 - Behavioral theories of organizational decision making highlight the importance of decision rules for information aggregation, which are used to combine individuals’ evaluations of alternatives into collective choice. We examine how resource constraints affect the ability to make effective decisions with aggregation rules, including majority voting, averaging opinions, and delegating to experts. Using a series of computational experiments, we find that which rule is best depends on how an organization uses scarce resources to improve members’ knowledge of alternatives (accuracy resources) and include them in decisions (inclusion resources). By demonstrating the interdependence of resources and aggregation rules, we draw attention to the resource costs required to harness collective wisdom in organizations. We discuss implications for research on information aggregation and the design of organizational decision architectures and outline new directions for research.

N2 - Spreading depolarization (SD) occurs in a plethora of clinical conditions including migraine aura, delayed ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage and malignant hemispheric stroke. It describes waves of near-breakdown of ion homeostasis, particularly Na+ homeostasis in brain gray matter. SD induces tone alterations in resistance vessels, causing either hyperperfusion in healthy tissue; or hypoperfusion (inverse hemodynamic response = spreading ischemia) in tissue at risk. Observations from mice with genetic dysfunction of the ATP1A2-encoded α2-isoform of Na+/K+-ATPase (α2NaKA) suggest a mechanistic link between (1) SD, (2) vascular dysfunction, and (3) salt-sensitive hypertension via α2NaKA. Thus, α2NaKA-dysfunctional mice are more susceptible to SD and show a shift toward more inverse hemodynamic responses. α2NaKA-dysfunctional patients suffer from familial hemiplegic migraine type 2, a Mendelian model disease of SD. α2NaKA-dysfunctional mice are also a genetic model of salt-sensitive hypertension. To determine whether SD thresholds and hemodynamic responses are also altered in other genetic models of salt-sensitive hypertension, we examined these variables in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp). Compared with Wistar Kyoto control rats, we found in SHRsp that electrical SD threshold was significantly reduced, propagation speed was increased, and inverse hemodynamic responses were prolonged. These results may have relevance to both migraine with aura and stroke.

N2 - This paper advocates for causal models of the emergency management cycle (EMC) for decision support in epidemic or pandemic scenarios. The model capability is demonstrated for the case of the COVID-19 attack at the NATO flagship USS Theodore Roosevelt in early 2020. Computational intelligence is a reasonable approach for dealing with uncertainties such as low reliability of information and source credibility. The proposed EMC causal models enable the development of countermeasures for epidemiological attacks using the notion of gaps in the four EMC phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, the EMC problem can be formulated and formalized as bridging the identified technology–society gap, e.g., mitigation of risks and biases; and machine reasoning can be incorporated at any level of the EMC decision-making. Using available real-world data on the USS Theodore Roosevelt outbreak, we show how machine reasoning mechanisms can help the captain to make more reliable decisions in critical epidemiological situations.

N2 - This review aims to synthesise a large pre-clinical and clinical literature related to a hypothesised role of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system in responses to acute and chronic threat, as well as the emergence of pathological anxiety. The locus coeruleus has widespread norepinephrine projections throughout the central nervous system, which act to globally modulate arousal states and adaptive behavior, crucially positioned to play a significant role in modulating both ascending visceral and descending cortical neurocognitive information. In response to threat or a stressor, the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system globally modulates arousal, alerting and orienting functions and can have a powerful effect on the regulation of multiple memory systems. Chronic stress leads to amplification of locus coeruleus reactivity to subsequent stressors, which is coupled with the emergence of pathological anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. While direct in vivo evidence for locus coeruleus dysfunction in humans with pathological anxiety remains limited, recent advances in high-resolution 7-T magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling approaches are starting to provide new insights into locus coeruleus characteristics.

N2 - Battery system is the key part of the electric vehicle. To realize outlier detection in the running process of battery system effectively, a new high-dimensional data stream outlier detection algorithm (DSOD) based on angle distribution is proposed. First, in order to improve the algorithm stability in high-dimensional space, the method of angle distribution-based outlier detection algorithm is employed. Second, to reduce the computational complexity, a small-scale calculation set of data stream is established, which is composed of normal set and border set. For the purpose of solving the problem of concept drift, an update mechanism for the normal set and border set is developed in this paper. By this way, these hidden abnormal points will be rapidly detected. The experimental results on real data sets and battery system simulation data sets demonstrate that DSOD is more efficient than Simple variance of angles (Simple VOA) and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) and is very suitable for the evaluation of battery system safety.

N2 - LLM-based chatbots’ ability to generate contextually appropriate and informative texts can be taken as an indication that they are also able to understand text. We argue instead that the separation of the two competences to generate and to understand text is the key to their performance in dialog with human users. This argument requires a shift in perspective from a concern with machine intelligence to a concern with communicative competence. We illustrate our argument with empirical examples of what conversation analysis calls ‘repair’, showing that the management of trouble by chatbots is not based on an underlying understanding of what is going on but rather on their use of the feedback by human conversational partners. In the conclusion we suggest that strategies for the interaction between chatbots and users should not aim to improve computational skills but to develop a new communicative competence.

N2 - Simulation offers a simple and flexible way to estimate the power of a clinical trial when analytic formulae are not available. The computational burden of using simulation has, however, restricted its application to only the simplest of sample size determination problems, often minimising a single parameter (the overall sample size) subject to power being above a target level. We describe a general framework for solving simulation-based sample size determination problems with several design parameters over which to optimise and several conflicting criteria to be minimised. The method is based on an established global optimisation algorithm widely used in the design and analysis of computer experiments, using a non-parametric regression model as an approximation of the true underlying power function. The method is flexible, can be used for almost any problem for which power can be estimated using simulation, and can be implemented using existing statistical software packages. We illustrate its application to a sample size determination problem involving complex clustering structures, two primary endpoints and small sample considerations.

N2 - Density-based clustering for big data is critical for many modern applications ranging from Internet data processing to massive-scale moving object management. This paper proposes Cludoop algorithm, an efficient distributed density-based clustering for big data using Hadoop. First, we propose a serial clustering algorithm CluC by leveraging cell partition optimization and c-cluster to fast find clusters. CluC completes classification of the points using the relationships of connected cells around points instead of expensive completed neighbor query, which significantly reduce the number of distance calculations. Second, we propose the Cludoop, which can efficiently cluster very-large-scale data in parallel using already existing data partition on Map/Reduce platform. It employs the proposed serial clustering CluC as a plugged-in clustering on parallel mapper, along with a cell description instead of completed cell in transmission to reduce both network and I/O costs. Guided by proposed cell-based principles, we also design a Merging-Refinement-Merging 3-step framework to merge c-clusters on the overlay of assigned preclustering result on reducer. Finally, our comprehensive experimental evaluation on 10 network-connected commercial PCs, using both huge-volume real and synthetic data, demonstrates (1) the effectiveness of our algorithm in finding correct clusters with arbitrary shape and (2) the fact that our proposed algorithm exhibits better scalability and efficiency than state-of-the-art method.
