N2 - Evidence that women have paid the price of what has been labeled the “shadow pandemic” is found in the increase in violence against them. The rates of femicide and lack of trust in the Turkish judicial system of the authoritarian government are worrisome. Protests have been made in the streets and through social media in response. Our goal was to determine the role of legacy news media and social media in bringing awareness of the femicide issue to the public and how affective publics function surrounding a relatively unaddressed societal problem using datasets created by women’s organizations. We conducted a content analysis on 150 sampled femicide cases in Turkey before and during the pandemic taken from online news sources. We investigated the quality of traditional news media coverage and the volume of social media users expressing emotional reactions to individual femicides over time. Results suggest that the journalistic performance of covering the issue of femicide fails to detail essential facts, and awareness and concern for the issue are evident in the Likes, retweets, shares, and expressions of emotional engagement provided to the victims, while online reactions to femicide have increased substantially since 2019, contributing to the formation of affective publics. The study makes a conceptual contribution to the understanding of legacy media and social media’s roles in spurring public engagement about serious social problems in autocratic political contexts while advancing the methodological tools of combining social scientific techniques with computational ones.

N2 - Accurate assessment of nozzle guide vane (NGV) capacity is essential for understanding engine performance data, and to achieve accurate turbine stage matching. In accelerated engine development programmes in particular, accurate and early assessment of NGV capacity is a significant advantage. Whilst the capabilities of computational methods have improved rapidly in recent years, the accuracy of absolute capacity prediction capability is lower than experimental techniques by some margin. Thus, experimental measurement of NGV capacity is still regarded as an essential part of many engine programmes. The semi-transient capacity measurement technique, developed and refined at the University of Oxford over the last 10 years, allows rapid and accurate measurement of engine component (typically fully cooled NGVs) capacity at engine-representative conditions of Mach and Reynolds numbers and coolant-to-mainstream pressure ratio. The technique has been demonstrated to offer considerable advantages over traditional (industrial steady-state) techniques in terms of accuracy, time and operating cost. Since the original facility was constructed, the facility has been modularised to allow for rapid interchange of test vane modules, and the instrumentation has been optimised to drive down the uncertainty in NGV capacity. In this paper, these improvements are described in detail, and a detailed uncertainty analysis is presented of the original facility, the current facility, and a proposed future facility in which the uncertainty of the measurement has been driven down to a practical limit. The bias errors of the three facilities are determined to be ±0.535%, ± 0.495% and ±0.301%, respectively (to 95% confidence). The corresponding precision uncertainties are ±0.028%, ±0.025% and ±0.025%, respectively. The extremely low precision uncertainty in particular allows very small changes in capacity to be resolved. This, combined with rapid interchangeability of test modules, allows studies of the sensitivity of capacity to secondary influences with much greater flexibility than was previously possible. Consideration is also given to the definition of vane capacity in systems with several streams at different conditions of inlet total pressure and temperature. A typical high pressure (HP) NGV has three distinct streams: a mainstream flow; coolant flow ejected from film cooling holes (distributed over the vane surface); and trailing edge coolant ejection. Whilst it is helpful for the coolant mass flow rates and inlet temperatures to be included in the definition, only a relatively small difference arises from the way in which this is achieved. Several definitions appear to share similar usefulness in terms of their robustness to changing inlet conditions of individual streams, but the favoured definition offers the possibility of isolating sensitivities to key effects such as trailing edge coolant ejection. This is achieved by explicitly expressing vane capacity as a function of two controlling pressure ratios. The overall purpose of this paper is to review and analyse in detail the current state-of-the-art in gas turbine flow capacity measurement.

N2 - Application of acute therapies such as thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke (IS) is constrained because of diagnostic uncertainty and the dynamic nature of stroke biology. To investigate changes in blood proteins after stroke and as a result of thrombolysis treatment we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on serum samples using high-resolution mass spectrometry and long high-performance liquid chromatography gradient (5 hours) combined with a 50-cm column to optimise the peptide separation. We identified (false discovery rate [FDR]: 1%) and quantified a total of 574 protein groups from a total of 92 samples from 30 patients. Ten patients were treated by thrombolysis as part of a randomised placebo-controlled trial and up to 5 samples were collected from each individual at different time points after stroke. We identified 26 proteins differently expressed by treatment group (FDR: 5%) and significant changes of expression over time for 23 proteins (FDR: 10%). Molecules such as fibrinogen and C-reactive protein showed expression profiles with a high-potential clinical utility in the acute stroke setting. Protein expression profiles vary acutely in the blood after stroke and have the potential to allow the construction of a stroke clock and to have an impact on IS treatment decision making.

N2 - Researchers have been studying the viral flow of information since the late 1990s, but this work has mainly focused on big sites like Twitter and Facebook. However, to comprehensively explore social phenomena such as virality requires us to look beyond the dominant networks. This study addresses this by looking at how users think about virality on Dribbble, a social network site with around 600,000 users that was created in 2009 for designers to showcase and get feedback on their work and to connect clients to design talent. Interviews confirm that viral-like events do exist on Dribbble. Our informants suggest that what spreads on Dribbble are elements of design (e.g., color palettes, line styles, textures), and they identify a number of factors they believe drive these viral-like events, which are the same kinds of factors that drive virality on larger sites. We briefly discuss how Dribbble feeds the gig economy in the creative industry and how virality becomes an important path for designers in a competitive environment. This work makes a contribution to the study of virality by focusing a small niche social media site and by looking at how users perceive and think about viral events.

N2 - Two independent statistical tests of item compromise are presented, one based on the test takers’ responses and the other on their response times (RTs) on the same items. The tests can be used to monitor an item in real time during online continuous testing but are also applicable as part of post hoc forensic analysis. The two test statistics are simple intuitive quantities as the sum of the responses and RTs observed for the test takers on the item. Common features of the tests are ease of interpretation and computational simplicity. Both tests are uniformly most powerful under the assumption of known ability and speed parameters for the test takers. Examples of power functions for items with realistic parameter values suggest maximum power for 20–30 test takers with item preknowledge for the response-based test and 10–20 test takers for the RT-based test.

N2 - The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the psychometric properties of the Learning Orientation Questionnaire (LOQ), which have not been previously published. Psychometric validation involves the accumulation of proper empirical evidence to confirm measurement of the intended construct, and to justify the intended uses of the scales. LOQ is based upon the intentional learning theory, which is a comprehensive, holistic learning theory. Through the expertise of the LOQ’s developer, educational researcher, and psychometrician, this article presents evidence of LOQ’s reliability and validity according to published best practices for scale development and validation. LOQ is a reliable and valid instrument determining where learners fall along the learning orientation continuum. Education researchers can use this information to support learners to move upward on the learning orientation continuum, improving their inclination to learn, high-order thinking, and life-long learning.

N2 - Sentiment analysis (SA) has recently developed an automated approach for assessing sentiment, emotion, and these reviews or opinions to extract relevant and subjective information from text-based data. Analyzing sentiment on social networks, such as Twitter, has become a powerful means of learning about the users’ opinions and better understanding and satisfaction. However, it consumes time and energy to disperse and collect surveys from clients, often inaccurate and inconsistent, and evaluating and improving the accuracy of the methods in sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper uses NLP, text analysis, biometrics, and computational linguistics to detect and extract replies, moods, or emotions from Skytrax Airline Customers’ Feedback SACF data. This research uses deep learning models to analyze various approaches applied to small SACF to solve sentiment analysis problems. We applied word embedding (Glove embedding models) to improve the sentiment classification performance of a series of datasets extensively utilized for feature extractions. Finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the SACF data analysis utilizing deep learning (DL)for evaluating the performance of the different models and input features, which is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CONV1D), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for application to big datasets in 2019. This approach was assessed using each classification technique; the precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics for sentiment analysis have been identified. And The results show that LSTM outperforms in classification accuracy; the outcome was 91%.

N2 - Generally, the Swiss hold favourable attitudes to organ donation, but only few carry a donor card. If no card is found on a potential donor, families have to be approached about donation. The aim of this paper is to model the role that some family communication factors play in the family decision to consent or not to organ donation by a brain dead relative. Information was gathered in face-to-face interviews, using a questionnaire and recording open answers and comments. Eight heads of intensive care units (ICU) of Swiss hospitals and one representative from Swisstransplant were interviewed. Questions asked respondents to estimate the prevalence and effect of communication factors in families facing a decision to consent to donation. Answers were averaged for modelling purposes. Modelling also relies on a previous representative population survey for cross-validation. The family of the deceased person is almost always approached about donation. Physicians perceive that prior thinking and favourable predisposition to donation are correlated and that the relatives’ predisposition is the most important factor for the consent to donation, up to the point that a negative predisposition may override an acknowledged wish of the deceased to donate. Donor cards may trigger family communication and ease the physicians’ approach to family about donation. Campaigns should encourage donate-willing people to talk to their families about it, make people think about organ donation and try to change unfavourable predispositions.

N2 - Cloud computing is a well-known technology that provides flexible, efficient, and cost-effective information technology solutions for multinationals to offer improved and enhanced quality of business services to end-users. The cloud computing paradigm is instigated from grid and parallel computing models as it uses virtualization, server consolidation, utility computing, and other computing technologies and models for providing better information technology solutions for large-scale computational data centers. The recent intensifying computational demands from multinationals enterprises have motivated the magnification for large complicated cloud data centers to handle business, monetary, Internet, and commercial applications of different enterprises. A cloud data center encompasses thousands of millions of physical server machines arranged in racks along with network, storage, and other equipment that entails an extensive amount of power to process different processes and amenities required by business firms to run their business applications. This data center infrastructure leads to different challenges like enormous power consumption, underutilization of installed equipment especially physical server machines, CO2 emission causing global warming, and so on. In this article, we highlight the data center issues in the context of Pakistan where the data center industry is facing huge power deficits and shortcomings to fulfill the power demands to provide data and operational services to business enterprises. The research investigates these challenges and provides solutions to reduce the number of installed physical server machines and their related device equipment. In this article, we proposed server consolidation technique to increase the utilization of already existing server machines and their workloads by migrating them to virtual server machines to implement green energy-efficient cloud data centers. To achieve this objective, we also introduced a novel Virtualized Task Scheduling Algorithm to manage and properly distribute the physical server machine workloads onto virtual server machines. The results are generated from a case study performed in Pakistan where the proposed server consolidation technique and virtualized task scheduling algorithm are applied on a tier-level data center. The results obtained from the case study demonstrate that there are annual power savings of 23,600 W and overall cost savings of US$78,362. The results also highlight that the utilization ratio of already existing physical server machines has increased to 30% compared to 10%, whereas the number of server machines has reduced to 50% contributing enormously toward huge power savings.

N2 - Our ability to unravel the mysteries of human health and disease have changed dramatically over the past 2 decades. Decoding health and disease has been facilitated by the recent availability of high-throughput genomics and multi-omics analyses and the companion tools of advanced informatics and computational science. Understanding of the human genome and its influence on phenotype continues to advance through genotyping large populations and using “light phenotyping” approaches in combination with smaller subsets of the population being evaluated using “deep phenotyping” approaches. Using our capability to integrate and jointly analyze genomic data with other multi-omic data, the knowledge of genotype-phenotype relationships and associated genetic pathways and functions is being advanced. Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships that discriminate human health from disease is speculated to facilitate predictive, precision health care and change modes of health care delivery. The American Association for Dental Research Fall Focused Symposium assembled experts to discuss how studies of genotype-phenotype relationships are illuminating the pathophysiology of craniofacial diseases and developmental biology. Although the breadth of the topic did not allow all areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial research to be addressed (e.g., cancer), the importance and power of integrating genomic, phenomic, and other -omic data are illustrated using a variety of examples. The 8 Fall Focused talks presented different methodological approaches for ascertaining study populations and evaluating population variance and phenotyping approaches. These advances are reviewed in this summary.
