N2 - Machine learning and other computer-driven prediction models are one of the fastest growing trends in computational social science. These methods and approaches were developed in computer science and with different goals and epistemologies than those in social science. The most obvious difference being a focus on prediction versus explanation. Predictive modeling offers great potential for improving research and theory development, but its adoption poses some challenges and creates new problems. For this reason, Hofman et al. published recommendations for more effective integration of predictive modeling into social science. In this communication, I review their recommendations and expand on some additional concerns related to current practices and whether prediction can effectively serve the goals of most social scientists. Overall, I argue they provide a sound set of guidelines and a classification scheme that will serve those of us working in computational social science.

N2 - Recent work suggests that the positive manifold of individual differences may arise, or be amplified, by a mechanism called mutualism. Kievit et al. (2017) showed that a latent change score implementation of the mutualism model outperformed alternative models, demonstrating positive reciprocal interactions between vocabulary and reasoning during development. Here, we replicated these findings in a cohort of children (N = 227, 6–8 years old) and expanded the findings in three directions. First, a third wave of data was included, and the findings were robust to alternative model specifications. Second, a simulation demonstrated that data sets of similar magnitude and distributional properties could have, in principle, favored alternative models with close to 100% power. Third, we found support for the hypothesis that mutualistic-coupling effects are stronger and self-feedback parameters weaker in younger children. Together, these findings replicated the work of Kievit et al. (2017) and further support the hypothesis that mutualism supports cognitive development.

N2 - In this article, we look at spontaneous combustion due to exothermic chemical reaction taking place within a stockpile of combustible material. The model includes mass and energy balance equations in a spherical domain. The complicated chemical reaction is simplified by considering a one-dimensional process. The differential equations governing the problem are solved using semi-implicit finite difference method. The effects of kinetic parameters embedded within the system are analyzed and the results are expressed graphically and discussed accordingly.

N2 - Fog computing is viewed as an extended technique of cloud computing. In Internet of things–based collaborative fog computing systems, a fog node aggregating lots of data from Internet of things devices has to transmit the information to distributed cloud servers that will collaboratively verify it based on some predefined auditing policy. However, compromised fog nodes controlled by an adversary might inject bogus data to cheat or confuse remote servers. It also causes the waste of communication and computation resources. To further control the lifetime of signing capability for fog nodes, an appropriate mechanism is crucial. In this article, the author proposes a time-constrained strong multi-designated verifier signature scheme to meet the above requirement. In particular, a conventional non-delegatable strong multi-designated verifier signature scheme with low computation is first given. Based on its constructions, we show how to transform it into a time-constrained variant. The unforgeability of the proposed schemes is formally proved based on the famous elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumption. The security requirement of strong signer ambiguity for our substantial constructions is also analyzed by utilizing the intractable assumption of decisional Diffie–Hellman. Moreover, some comparisons in terms of the signature size and computational costs for involved entities among related mechanisms are made.

N2 - Differences between computationally generated and human-generated themes in unstructured text are important to understand yet difficult to assess formally. In this study, we bridge these approaches through two contributions. First, we formally compare a primarily computational approach, topic modeling, to a primarily human-driven approach, qualitative thematic coding, in an impactful context: physician mothers’ experience of workplace discrimination. Second, we compare our chosen topic model to a principled alternative topic model to make explicit study design decisions meriting consideration in future research. By formally contrasting computationally generated (i.e. topic modeling) and human-generated (i.e. thematic coding) knowledge, we shed light on issues of interest to several audiences, notably computational social scientists who wish to understand study design tradeoffs, and qualitative researchers who may wish to leverage computational methods to improve the speed and reproducibility of labor-intensive coding. Although useful in other domains, we highlight the value of fast, reproducible methods to better understand experiences of workplace discrimination.

N2 - Background: Adoption of organic fertilization is low among farmers in rural areas of Ethiopia, affecting yields and general food security in the region. This study aimed to identify the determinants of the utilization of organic fertilizers among smallholder farmers in the South Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State (ANRS), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was used among smallholder farmers in the South Gondar Zone, ANRS, Northwest Ethiopia. Primary data were collected from 420 sample respondents using multistage sampling with a combination of both simple random and cluster sampling techniques. The binary logistic regression model was used to assess the use of organic fertilizers among smallholder farmers in the South Gondar Zone. The results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: head of household age (AOR = 1.099, 95% CI 1.018-1.187), married marital status (AOR = 10.506, 95% CI 1.355-81.427), literate head of household (AOR = 3.323, 95% CI 1.571-7.029), number of laborers (AOR = 1.442, 95% CI 1.060-1.962), farming experience (AOR = 1.132, 95% CI 1.041-1.232), farm size (AOR = 1.063, 95% CI 1.008-1.121), and number of livestock (AOR = 1.368, 95% CI 1.115-1.677) were positively associated with the utilization of organic fertilizer while single marital status (AOR = 0.062, 95% CI 0.004-0.851), cost of laborer (AOR = 0.965, 95% CI 0.951-0.978), household income (AOR = 0.880, 95% CI 0.824-0.939), medium soil fertility (AOR = 0.039, 95% CI 0.007-0.229), fertile soil (AOR = 0.020, 95% CI 0.003-0.120), and home to farm distance (AOR = 0.219, 95% CI 0.067-0.717) were negatively associated with the utilization of organic fertilizer. Conclusions: This finding showed that multiple variables have an effect to determining the use of organic fertilizer by smallholder farmers. Therefore, the finding is important to adopt programs to encourage the use of organic fertilizer, implement policies in an attempt to adapt the use of organic fertilizer among the South Gondar Zone, and critically consider these factors. Furthermore, extension workers should focus on raising awareness about the importance of organic fertilizers to encourage or expand their use among smallholder farmers.

N2 - In this work, a method is developed for geometric definition and analysis of cylindrical milling tools having various free-form variations of helix angle. The method is based on replicating a position vector on each cutting edge to generate a point set for the whole tool envelope using piece-wise rotation and magnification matrices which are varied according to mathematical laws describing the intended variable shape of the tool. The computed point sets are applied in additive manufacturing of samples of such tools having non-conventional shape features by transforming the point sets to stereolithography formats that are sliced to guide the 3D-printing processes. This manufacturing route that simplifies the realization of arbitrary helix profiles on milling tools is a major contribution of this work since such tools are gaining popularity for their passive damping of vibrations and reduction of cutting forces but are notoriously difficult to manufacture, limiting their exploitation. Analyses are shown about the effects of the considered variable profiles on milling cutting force. These suggest that cutting forces can be greatly suppressed by the proposed free-form helix angle variations. For example, relative to a conventional fixed helix tool of same mean helix angle, the innovative tools recorded 40.33%–84.42% and 60.53%–67.81% force reductions at axial depths of cut of 1 and 5 mm. This demonstrates that innovative variable tool profiles which can be realized through the simplified rapid prototyping technique are promising for advanced sustainable manufacturing of parts with preferred surface conditions.

N2 - With the wide adoption of wireless sensor network (WSN), security problems emerge as a challenging issue because of the limited computational power and energy of the sensor nodes. Furthermore, the deployment of WSN in the hostile area with a large number of nodes also poses a threat. In this paper, we proposed a new efficient key management scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and AVL tree for large scale WSNs. In our scheme the Elliptic Curve Paillier Encryption (ECPE) cryptography is adopted for communication and the AVL tree is used to store the neighbors’ ID and public key. The number of keys used in our scheme is smaller than the proposed schemes as we store these keys using AVL tree to shorten the search time. Regular key updates are also designed to further improve the security of the whole network. Our scheme has a good scalability where the node addition and deletion are supported. Experimental results and analysis show our scheme can significantly reduce the energy consumed by the node and reduce the memory and computational overhead.

N2 - In this article, we argue that offline inequalities, such as core–periphery relations of the music industry, are reproduced by streaming platforms. First, we offer an overview of the reproduction of inequalities and core–periphery dynamics in the music industry. Then we illustrate this through a small-scale network analysis case study of Hungarian metal bands’ connections on Spotify. We show that the primary determinant of a given band’s international connectedness in Spotify’s algorithmic ecosystem is their international label connections. Bands on international labels have more reciprocal international connections and are more likely to be recommended based on actual genre similarity. However, bands signed with local labels or self-published tend to have domestic connections and to be paired with other artists by Spotify’s recommendation system according to their country of origin.

N2 - Right-ventricular function is a good indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) prognosis; however, how the right ventricle (RV) adapts to the pressure overload is not well understood. Here, we aimed at characterizing the time course of RV early remodeling and discriminate the contribution of ventricular geometric remodeling and intrinsic changes in myocardial mechanical properties in a monocrotaline (MCT) animal model. In a longitudinal study of PAH, ventricular morphology and function were assessed weekly during the first four weeks after MCT exposure. Using invasive measurements of RV pressure and volume, heart performance was evaluated at end of systole and diastole to quantify contractility (end-systolic elastance) and chamber stiffness (end-diastolic elastance). To distinguish between morphological and intrinsic mechanisms, a computational model of the RV was developed and used to determine the level of prediction when accounting for wall masses and unloaded volume measurements changes. By four weeks, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and elastance rose significantly. RV pressures rose significantly after the second week accompanied by significant RV hypertrophy, but RV stroke volume and cardiac output were maintained. The model analysis suggested that, after two weeks, this compensation was only possible due to a significant increase in the intrinsic inotropy of RV myocardium. We conclude that this MCT-PAH rat is a model of RV compensation during the first month after treatment, where geometric remodeling on EDPVR and increased myocardial contractility on ESPVR are the major mechanisms by which stroke volume is preserved in the setting of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. The mediators of this compensation might themselves promote longer-term adverse remodeling and decompensation in this animal model.
