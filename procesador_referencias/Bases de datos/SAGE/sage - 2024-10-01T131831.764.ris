N2 - This article examines how algorithmic accountability is translated into action at the municipal level in the United States. Based on a review of task forces, ordinances, and policy toolkits from New York City and Seattle, I demonstrate the ways municipalities and local publics operationalize abstract notions of accountability. Municipal interventions often prioritize revealing computational tools (transparency) and their effects on people (impact assessments). While these two forms of accountability are crucial, they may neglect to examine institutions—and how they change—as they incorporate automated decision systems. I thus propose a political-economic approach that recognizes algorithmic systems as part of municipal institutions and focuses on their role in intensifying data collection and commodification between public agencies and markets. I argue that algorithmic accountability, especially in public agencies, needs to focus on incompetence and asymmetries of power within a network of governments, tech companies, community groups, and technologies. With a mix of transparency, impact assessments, and political economic review, the paper proposes a more comprehensive assessment of automated decision systems through their development, procurement, use, impact, and decommissioning.

N2 - A recent innovation in the field of machine learning has been the creation of very large pre-trained models, also referred to as ‘foundation models’, that draw on much larger and broader sets of data than typical deep learning systems and can be applied to a wide variety of tasks. Underpinning text-based systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and image generators such as Midjourney, these models have received extraordinary amounts of public attention, in part due to their reliance on prompting as the main technique to direct and apply them. This paper thus uses prompting as an entry point into the critical study of foundation models and their implications. The paper proceeds as follows: In the first section, we introduce foundation models in more detail, outline some of the main critiques, and present our general approach. We then discuss prompting as an algorithmic technique, show how it makes foundation models programmable, and explain how it enables different audiences to use these models as (computational) platforms. In the third section, we link the material properties of the technologies under scrutiny to questions of political economy, discussing, in turn, deep user interactions, reordered cost structures, and centralization and lock-in. We conclude by arguing that foundation models and prompting further strengthen Big Tech’s dominance over the field of computing and, through their broad applicability, many other economic sectors, challenging our capacities for critical appraisal and regulatory response.

N2 - The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used to evaluate the physiological function of the nose. We evaluated the aerodynamics of the nasal cavity in a patient with septal perforation (SP), pre- and postvirtual repair. Three-dimensional nasal models were reconstructed, and then a wide range of the pressure drops and flow rates were analyzed. The airflow velocity is higher in the central region and is lower around the boundary of the SP. The air velocity in the SP increases as the pressure drop increases. Furthermore, at the anterior part of the SP, the shear stress is higher in the upper part. In addition, the repair of SP does not affect the total nasal airflow rate and the velocity contour patterns. The potential usage of the CFD technique as a predictive technique to explore the details and a preoperative assessment tool to help in clinical decision making in nasal surgery is emphasized.

N2 - In this study, blends of polypropylene (PP) with polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biopolymers and wood flour were prepared, and Fuzzy and Grey Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods were used to determine the blends with the best properties. The physical, mechanical, thermal, structural, and morphological properties of the composites were determined. The obtained results showed that PLA and wood flour generally improved the mechanical properties of the PP composites. However, wood flour did not exhibit a homogeneous distribution in the matrix. The density of the composites generally increased with the addition of both PLA and PHB. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the crystallinity index of the composites generally decreased due to the low crystallinity of biopolymers. Thermal stability did not change with the addition of PLA and PHB, but the addition of wood increased thermal stability. According to the MCDM analysis, both Fuzzy and Grey results were similar.

N2 - The present work focuses on the computational modelling of fluid flow in a mixing stirred reactor to describe the flow pattern in two-dimensional (2D) detail, which can be useful for optimizing the parameters of electroplating for the production of a uniform film on metallic particles in a stirred electrolytic cell. The results of modelling and simulation show that the electrolytic cell geometry and the presence of a solid electrode affect the streamline distribution. The most important parameter affecting the fluid flow is not just the position but also the size of the stirrer as well. It is concluded that the “high cell” with the “big stirrer” can be used for the electroplating of iron micro-and nanoparticles in the presence of the cylindrical electrode.

N2 - This article addresses information-based sensing point selection from a set of possible sensing locations. A potential game approach has been applied to addressing distributed decision making for cooperative sensor planning. For a large sensor network, the local utility function for an agent is difficult to compute, because the utility function depends on the other agents’ decisions, while each sensing agent is inherently faced with limitations in both its communication and computational capabilities. Accordingly, we propose an approximation method for a local utility function to accommodate limitations in information gathering and processing, using only a part of the decisions of other agents. The error induced by the approximation is also analyzed, and to keep the error small, we propose a selection algorithm that chooses the neighbor set for each agent in a greedy way. The selection algorithm is based on the correlation between one agent’s and the other agents’ measurement selection. Furthermore, we show that a game with an approximate utility function has an equilibrium and the set of the equilibria include the Nash equilibrium of the original potential game. We demonstrate the validity of our approximation method through two numerical examples on simplified weather forecasting and multi-target tracking.

N2 - In order to evaluate flow patterns and CCFL (countercurrent flow limitation) characteristics in a PWR hot leg under reflux condensation, numerical simulations have been done using a two-fluid model and a VOF (volume of fluid) method implemented in the CFD software, FLUENT6.3.26. The two-fluid model gave good agreement with CCFL data under low pressure conditions but did not give good results under high pressure steam-water conditions. On the other hand, the VOF method gave good agreement with CCFL data for tests with a rectangular channel but did not give good results for calculations in a circular channel. Therefore, in this paper, the computational grid and schemes were improved in the VOF method, numerical simulations were done for steam-water flows at 1.5 MPa under PWR full-scale conditions with the diameter of 0.75 m, and the calculated results were compared with the UPTF data at 1.5 MPa. As a result, the calculated flow pattern was found to be similar to the flow pattern observed in small-scale air-water tests, and the calculated CCFL characteristics agreed well with the UPTF data at 1.5 MPa except in the region of a large steam volumetric flux.

N2 - Gas-liquid flow in microchannels is widely used in biomedicine, nanotech, sewage treatment, and so forth. Particularly, owing to the high qualities of the microbubbles and spheres produced in microchannels, it has a great potential to be used in ultrasound imaging and controlled drug release areas; therefore, gas-liquid flow in microchannels has been the focus in recent years. In this paper, numerical simulation of gas-liquid flows in a T-junction microchannel was carried out with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT and the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) model. The distribution of velocity, pressure, and phase of fluid in the microchannel was obtained, the pressure distribution along the channel walls was analyzed in order to give a better understanding on the formation of microbubbles in the T-junction microchannel.

N2 - The headache any researcher faces while using Twitter data for social scientific analysis is that we do not know who tweets. In this article, we report on results from the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) 2015 on Twitter use. We focus on associations between using Twitter and three demographic characteristics—age, sex, and class (defined here as National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification [NS-SEC]). In addition to this, we compare findings from BSA 2015, treated as ground truth (known characteristics), with previous attempts to map the demographic nature of UK Twitter users using computational methods resulting in demographic proxies. Where appropriate, the datasets are compared with UK Census 2011 data to illustrate that Twitter users are not representative of the wider population. We find that there are a disproportionate number of male Twitter users, in relation to both the Census 2011 and previous proxy estimates; that Twitter users are predominantly young, but there are more older users than previously estimated; and that there are strong class effects associated with Twitter use.

N2 - Camera sensor networks have developed as a new technology for the wide-area video surveillance. In view of the limited power and computational capability of the camera nodes, the paper presents an abnormal behavior detection approach which is convenient and available for camera sensor networks. Trajectory analysis and anomaly modeling are carried out by single-node processing, whereas anomaly detection is performed by multinode voting. The main contributions of the proposed method are summarized as follows. First, target trajectories are reconstructed and represented as symbol sequences. Second, the sequences are taken into account using Markov model for building the transition probability matrix which can be used to automatically analyze abnormal behavior. Third, the final decision of anomaly detection is made through the majority voting of local results of individual camera nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate typical abnormal behaviors in real scenes.
