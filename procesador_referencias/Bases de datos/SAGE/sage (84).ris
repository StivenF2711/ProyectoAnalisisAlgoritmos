N2 - There is growing research interest in the sharing of emotions through social media. Usually centred on ‘newsworthy’ events and collective ‘flows’ of emotion, this work is often computationally driven. This article presents an interaction-led analysis of small data from Twitter to illustrate how this kind of intensive focus can ‘thicken’ claims about emotions, and particularly empathy. Drawing on Goffman’s work on ritual, we introduce and then apply the idea of ‘empathy rituals’ to exchanges about emotional distress on Twitter, a platform primarily researched using big data approaches. While the potential of Goffman’s work has been explored in some depth in relation to digital performances, its emotional dimension has been less fully examined. Through a focus on Twitter conversations, we show how reading small data can inform computational social science claims about emotions and add to sociological understanding of emotion in (digital) publics.

N2 - Parents often select schools by relying on subjective assessments of quality made by other parents, which are increasingly becoming available through written reviews on school ratings websites. To identify relationships between review content and school quality, we apply recent advances in natural language processing to nearly half a million parent reviews posted for more than 50,000 publicly funded U.S. K–12 schools on a popular ratings website. We find: (1) schools in urban areas and those serving affluent families are more likely to receive reviews, (2) review language correlates with standardized test scores—which generally track race and family income—but not school effectiveness, measured by how much students improve in their test scores over time, and (3) the linguistics of reviews reveal several racial and income-based disparities in K–12 education. These findings suggest that parents who reference school reviews may be accessing, and making decisions based on, biased perspectives that reinforce achievement gaps.

N2 - This paper presents a study of use of the rhetorical figure of antithesis and other contrastive relations in several modern-day environmental science policy journal articles on issues of food security, climate change, and water resource management. The articles present the conflicting perspectives of environmentalists and engineers, i.e., the view that nature should be preserved and protected versus the view that it should be engineered to solve human problems. The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy characterizing argumentative uses of contrastive relations in these articles based on our semantic/pragmatic interpretation of text including, in some cases, discourse coherence relations. The number of examples and the breadth of the taxonomy is indicative of the key role of contrastive relations in argumentation in this genre. This investigation is a necessary step towards comprehensive computational approaches to detecting antithesis and other contrastive relations and to identifying their argumentative roles.

N2 - The notion of unconscious perceptual inference, particularly in the shape of predictive coding, promises to address many of the problems of visual perception that has long preoccupied philosophy. The dichoptic viewing conditions during binocular rivalry presents an extreme example of the epistemic task confronting perceptual inference and rivalry is therefore an important test-case for the predictive coding framework. This talk explores what predictive coding can and cannot tell us about the mechanism behind rivalry. The guiding thought is that Bayesian inference and prediction error drive selection, dominance and alternation in rivalry, and a number of computational and empirical studies of rivalry are reviewed in this light. The talk also presents preliminary findings from interdisciplinary imaging and psychophysical studies of binocular rivalry, which test aspects of the predictive coding hypothesis.

N2 - One of the most replicable findings in psychology is the positive manifold: the observation that individual differences in cognitive abilities are universally positively correlated. Investigating the developmental origin of the positive manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults (N = 784; n = 563 across two waves, mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14–25 years), we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.

N2 - The computationally efficient damage identification technique for truss structures with elastic supports is proposed based on the force method. To transform the truss with supports into the equivalent free-standing model without supports, the novel zero-length dummy members are employed. General equilibrium equations and kinematic relations, in which the reaction forces and the displacements at the elastic supports are taken into account, are clearly formulated. The compatibility equations, in terms of forces in which the flexibilities of elastic supports are considered, are explicitly presented using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. Both member and reaction forces are simultaneously and directly obtained. Then, all nodal displacements including constrained nodes are back calculated from the member and reaction forces. Next, the microgenetic algorithm (MGA) is used to properly identify the site and the extent of multiple damages in truss structures. In order to verify the superiority of the current study, the numerical solutions are presented for the planar and space truss models with and without elastic supports. The numerical results indicate that the computational effort required by this study is found to be significantly lower than that of the displacement method.

N2 - To investigate the performance of engine cooling water pump in automobile with variable rotating speed, experimental tests and numerical simulation are carried out on an engine cooling water pump under the rotating speed of 2650, 2960, 3700, and 4300 r/min. The hydraulic performance under 3700 r/min rotating speed and the cavitation performance under 340 L/min flow rate are tested and analyzed. The predicted results agree well with the experimental results, indicating that the simulation has high accuracy. The results show that the head of engine cooling water pump increases gradually and the best-effective region moves toward high flow rate condition with the increase in rotating speed. The augment of rotating speed would deteriorate the internal flow fields and causes more energy losses, which is due to the increase in tip leakage flow and enhancement of rotor–stator interaction effects. And, the rotor–stator interaction effect is sensitive to the temperature under various rotating speeds. Furthermore, the required net positive suction head increases with the increase in rotational speed and anti-cavitation performance is weakened during cavitation conditions.

N2 - In the past studies, the influence of wheel structure design and optimization on the aerodynamic drag of car and heat transfer performance of brake disc was less studied. To study the influence mechanism, the finite element model for wheel aerodynamic analysis was established using computational fluid dynamic method and the correctness of the model was verified by the wind tunnel test data. The influence mechanism of the flow field on aerodynamic drag of car and wheel and heat transfer performance of brake disc was studied. The influence of wheel disc structure on aerodynamic drag coefficient of the car and average convective heat transfer coefficient of the brake discs was studied. The parametric model of the wheel under the computational fluid dynamic analysis was established using mesh morphing technology. A total of 100 and 10 sample points were extracted using the Hammersley Design and Optimal Latin Hypercube Design, respectively, to fit the radial basis function surrogate model and test the accuracy of the surrogate model. Based on the established surrogate model, taking the minimum of the wheel mass, the minimum of the aerodynamic drag coefficient of the car and the maximum of the average surface convective heat transfer coefficient of brake discs as objectives and design variables of wheel as constraints to ensure the wheel structural strength, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was adopted to carry out multi-objective optimization design for the wheel. Pareto frontier was obtained and a compromise solution was selected as the optimization design result. After the optimization design, the wheel mass is reduced by 8.28%, the aerodynamic drag coefficient of the car is reduced by 3.17% and the average surface convective heat transfer coefficient of brake discs is increased by 9.31%.

N2 - Perturbations of gene regulatory networks are essentially responsible for oncogenesis. Therefore, inferring the gene regulatory networks is a key step to overcoming cancer. In this work, we propose a method for inferring directed gene regulatory networks based on soft computing rules, which can identify important cause-effect regulatory relations of gene expression. First, we identify important genes associated with a specific cancer (colon cancer) using a supervised learning approach. Next, we reconstruct the gene regulatory networks by inferring the regulatory relations among the identified genes, and their regulated relations by other genes within the genome. We obtain two meaningful findings. One is that upregulated genes are regulated by more genes than downregulated ones, while downregulated genes regulate more genes than upregulated ones. The other one is that tumor suppressors suppress tumor activators and activate other tumor suppressors strongly, while tumor activators activate other tumor activators and suppress tumor suppressors weakly, indicating the robustness of biological systems. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cancer.

N2 - Background: Models of collective decision-making typically assume that individuals sample information independently and decide instantaneously. In most natural and sociological settings, however, decisions occur over some timescale in which group members gather information—often from multiple sources. Information sources may persist for varying lengths of time or be viewed concurrently and identically by multiple group members. These tendencies introduce spatio-temporal correlations in gathered information with poorly understood consequences. Research Design: Here, we develop a collective decision-making model in which individuals’ access and switch between two conflicting cues that differ in their spatio-temporal properties. Results: Our model reveals that spatially and temporally correlated cues can profoundly affect collective decisions. Specifically, we observe that spatially correlated cues are dominant when individuals rarely switch between sources of information. Temporally correlated cues, on the other hand, have the strongest impact when individuals frequently switch between information sources. We also discuss how much the usage of independent information must be increased to counter the impact of correlation. Conclusions: The present model represents a first step toward more accurately capturing the complex mechanisms underlying collective decision-making in natural systems and reveals multiple ways in which the properties of environmental cues can impact collective behavior.
