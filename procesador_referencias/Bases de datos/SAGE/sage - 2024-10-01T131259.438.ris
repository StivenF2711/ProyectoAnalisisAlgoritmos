N2 - Strategic success is usually associated with having deliberate intentions, prior stated goals and a comprehensively formulated plan for effective execution. This way of thinking is driven by a means–ends logic and underpinned by the cognitivist assumption that conscious thought and consequential reasoning drive effective action: such privileging of thought over action is endemic in strategic theorizing. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate the plausibility of other, pre-cognitive logics of strategic action and ‘intention’ as alternative explanatory bases for strategic success. We identify three such logics and their associated forms of intentionality. A ‘logic of practices’ views collectively shared habitus rather than conscious cognition/deliberate intention as the basis of effective strategic action. A ‘logic of situation’ emphasizes how situational momentum, tendencies and affordances themselves contain pre-cognitive ‘in-tensional’ impulses that actively elicit appropriate strategic responses. Finally, a ‘logic of potential’ associated with what Friedrich Nietzsche termed ‘will to power’. It is with this fourth logic, we suggest, that strategic intention becomes most effective. In will to power, strategy entails the relentless expanding of degrees of freedom from environmental constraints without presuming cognitive separation from it.

N2 - Although computational methods facilitate research studies greatly, academics with visual impairment cannot utilize these tools to their maximum potential. Not only do computational research methods themselves have many shortcomings, but the needs and problems encountered by researchers with visual impairment in using these tools are not identified. In particular, the use of qualitative data analysis software (Q-DAS) by researchers with visual impairment has not been thoroughly examined. Thus, the current article addresses the benefits that visually impaired researchers can gain from employing commercial Q-DAS software packages in analyzing qualitative data. Further, Q-DAS problems that researchers with visual impairments experience are discussed. In addition, the article proposes solutions by which Q-DAS utilization in studies performed by/for the visual impairment community could improve. The article has many significant contributions, not only for scholars with visual impairment but also for elderly scientists whose vision declines over time. The article addresses this topic through critical disability studies.

N2 - Netflix actively fueled what is known as the myth of big data, promoting their recommender system and data-driven production as cutting-edge, all-seeing, and all-knowing. Today, however, the company is increasingly acknowledging the role of human expertise and creativity. In this paper I explore the strategic repositioning of Netflix from technology company to entertainment company, enabling them to be understood as both “data” and “gut.” This transformation is discussed as motivated by the increasing public criticism of data and algorithms and the company’s foray into original programing. More specifically, I examine how Netflix, in public-facing materials, discusses big data and how those ideas are taken up in public discourse. These sources disclose an assumption of opposing characteristics between data and human expertise and creativity. As a point of a larger critique, I comment on the limitations of this data and human opposition for thinking about Netflix and technologies at large.

N2 - Exposure to inorganic arsenic induces skin cancer and abnormal pigmentation in susceptible humans. High-throughput gene transcription assays such as DNA microarrays allow for the identification of biological pathways affected by arsenic that lead to initiation and progression of skin cancer and abnormal pigmentation. The overall purpose of the reported research was to determine knowledge building insights on biomarker genes for arsenic toxicity to human epidermal cells by integrating a collection of gene lists annotated with biological information. The information sets included toxicogenomics gene-chemical interaction; enzymes encoded in the human genome; enriched biological information associated with genes; environmentally relevant gene sequence variation; and effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function. Molecular network construction for arsenic upregulated genes TNFSF18 (tumor necrosis factor [ligand] superfamily member 18) and IL1R2 (interleukin 1 Receptor, type 2) revealed subnetwork interconnections to E2F4, an oncogenic transcription factor, predominantly expressed at the onset of keratinocyte differentiation. Visual analytics integration of gene information sources helped identify RAC1, a GTP binding protein, and TFRC, an iron uptake protein as prioritized arsenic-perturbed protein targets for biological processes leading to skin hyperpigmentation. RAC1 regulates the formation of dendrites that transfer melanin from melanocytes to neighboring keratinocytes. Increased melanocyte den-dricity is correlated with hyperpigmentation. TFRC is a key determinant of the amount and location of iron in the epidermis. Aberrant TFRC expression could impair cutaneous iron metabolism leading to abnormal pigmentation seen in some humans exposed to arsenicals. The reported findings contribute to insights on how arsenic could impair the function of genes and biological pathways in epidermal cells. Finally, we developed visual analytics resources to facilitate further exploration of the information and knowledge building insights on arsenic toxicity to human epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes.

N2 - Wearable devices such as smartwatches are critical to energy consumption due to their small battery size. To reduce possible energy consumption for high computational tasks, task offloading is a solution, but smartwatches are usually connected to smartphones that are also exposed to energy-saving issues. To resolve this problem, we propose a task offloading model that compares the energy efficiency of two cases: offloading or no offloading. When a task is offloaded, energy of a smartphone is sacrificed instead of a smartwatch, and additional energy is used for the communication. To derive the condition of an offloading, the size of a task could be considered, but it is impossible to estimate accurate energy due to various computational specifications of smartphones as well as smartwatches. To generalize the task size for different CPU conditions, we propose to use Dhrystone million instructions per second. The proposed model was evaluated through our testbed and confirmed that it shows a reasonable offloading condition for both the smartphone and the smartwatch.

N2 - A truncated, mean-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson model is developed to handle under- and overdispersed count data owing to individual heterogeneity. The truncated nature of the data allows for a more direct implementation of the model than is utilized in previous work without too much computational burden. The model is applied to a large dataset of Test match cricket bowlers, where the data are in the form of small counts and range in time from 1877 to the modern day, leading to the inclusion of temporal effects to account for fundamental changes to the sport and society. Rankings of sportsmen and women based on a statistical model are often handicapped by the popularity of inappropriate traditional metrics, which are found to be flawed measures in this instance. Inferences are made using a Bayesian approach by deploying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain parameter estimates and to extract the innate ability of individual players. The model offers a good fit and indicates that there is merit in a more sophisticated measure for ranking and assessing Test match bowlers.

N2 - Downlink power control is revisited by assuming very large-scale networks. In very large-scale networks, conventional centralized power control schemes quickly become impractical owing to the huge computational burden and limited backhaul capacity. Alternative distributed power control schemes have been proposed; however, these schemes suffer from poor performance when compared with the centralized power control. In this work, a completely new approach to distributed downlink power control is proposed using a belief-propagation (BP) framework. The proposed BP approach includes two tasks: first, the sum rate maximizing power control problem is modeled as a factor graph representation. Second, a message-passing algorithm is constructed on the basis of the factor graph, which efficiently computes a near-optimal solution in a distributed manner. The practical issues for implementing the proposed BP approach are extensively discussed in terms of the computational complexity, signaling overhead, convergence, and latency. Surprisingly, the simulation results verify that the average sum rate performance of the proposed BP-based power control is nearly equivalent to that of centralized power control schemes. The proposed BP-based power control even outperforms the centralized binary on/off power control and approaches the performance of geometric programming power control, which is the best-known centralized power control, within only 0.8% of the average sum rate.

N2 - This paper presents a framework for tracking a mobile ground target (MGT) using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Challenges from pure theories to practical applications, including varying illumination, computational limits and a lack of clarity are considered. The procedure consists of four steps, namely: target detection, target localization, states estimation and UAV guidance. Firstly, the MGT in the wild is separated from the background using a Laplacian operator-based method. Next, the MGT is located by performing coordinate transformations with the assumption that the altitude of the ground is invariant and known. Afterwards, a Kalman filter is used to estimate the location and velocity of the MGT. Finally, a modified guidance law is developed to guide the UAV to circle and track the MGT. The performance of our framework is validated by simulations and a number of actual flight tests. The results indicate that the framework is effective and of low computational complexity, and in particular our modified guidance law can reduce the error of the tracking distance by about 75% in specified situations. With the proposed framework, such challenges caused by the actual system can be tackled effectively, and the fixed-wing UAV can track the MGT stably.

N2 - Data aggregation is an important method to reduce the energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs); however, it suffers from the security problems of data privacy and integrity. Existing solutions either have large communication and computation overheads or only produce inaccurate results. This paper proposes a novel secure data aggregation scheme based on homomorphic primitives in WSNs (abbreviated as SDA-HP). The scheme adopts a symmetric-key homomorphic encryption to protect data privacy and combines it with homomorphic MAC synchronically to check the aggregation data integrity. It compares the scheme with the previously known methods such as SIES, iPDA, and iCPDA in terms of the data privacy protection efficiency, integrity performance, computation overhead, communication overhead, and data aggregation accuracy. Simulation results and performance analysis show that our SDA-HP requires less communication and computation overheads than previously known methods and can effectively preserve data privacy, check data integrity, and achieve high data transmission efficiency and accurate data aggregation rate while consuming less energy to prolong network lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides both integrity and privacy based on homomorphic primitives.

N2 - The problem of consensus-based distributed tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with switching network topologies and outlier-corrupted sensor observations is considered. First, to attack the outlier-corrupted measurements, a robust Kalman filtering (RKF) scheme with weighted matrices on innovation sequences is introduced. The proposed RKF possesses high robustness against outliers while having similar computational burden as traditional Kalman filter. Then, each node estimates the network-wide agreement on target state using only communications between one-hop neighbors. In order to improve the convergent speed of the consensus filter in case of switching topologies, an adaptive weight update strategy is proposed. Note that the proposed algorithm relaxes the requirement of Gaussian noise statistics in contrast to the decentralized/distributed Kalman filters. Besides, unlike the existing consensus-based filters, we do not need to perform consensus filtering on the covariance matrices, which will reduce the computational and communicational burden abundantly. Finally, simulation examples are included to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed RKF and effectiveness of adaptive consensus approach.
