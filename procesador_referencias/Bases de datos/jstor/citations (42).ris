TI  - Values in Risk Assessment
AU  - Rozell, Daniel J.
AB  - Having discussed how the benefits of research are assessed, we turn our attention to assessing risks. The field of risk analysis is often categorized into three main branches: risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication (Paté-Cornell & Cox 2014). Risk management, the process of deciding how to address risks, is widely understood to include subjective value judgments (Aven & Renn 2010; Aven & Zio 2014). Meanwhile, there is an idealized notion that good risk assessments are relatively free of values (Hansson & Aven 2014). However, despite our best efforts at quantitative rigor, the outcomes of risk assessments reflect the many value judgments implicit in

TI  - IDENTIFYING SPATIAL ANALYTICAL MEASURES THAT EXPLOIT BLT DATA
AU  - Vis, Benjamin N.
AB  - By demonstrating that BLTs can be applied as a mapping practice, in essence an original data creation process is established. BLTs are a vehicle for making the socio-spatial information contained in the material differentiations of the built environment explicitly accessible for analysis and interpretation. While the other methods for analysing the urban built environment considered in Chapter 6 are influential precursors, none of these maintain a commensurate perspective and research agenda. The next step is to consider how this new data can help to enable and equip the radical comparative study of the inhabited urban built environment. For this, the

Entering through porous boundaries (no matter how well policed these boundaries might be), the suicide bomber reminds us that the other will arrive by way of doors and interfaces. While the openness of nation-states varies, the ease with which bodies can move through transportation infrastructures ensures that no space can be completely sealed off from the threat of a suicide bomb. But the uncertainty and complexity of networked life can affect the suicide bomber herself too.  On December 31, 2010, a suicide bomb attack was

Generativists took the distinction between Langue and Parole on board, accepting there to be structural facts and usage facts that are in principle independent of each other and can be described in complete isolation from each other. Once performance errors are declared irrelevant to competence, it suffices to describe facts about structure or competence, to the neglect of use or performance. As an added bonus, allowing linguists to study an idealized version of language greatly simplified linguistic analysis.  Cognitive and functional approaches

It highlights how the very presence and movement of ‘unseaworthy boats’ in this actively orientated space of the sea brings to the fore the many strategies and techniques that have been employed to make it a space of European control. We argue that this is an active and deadly orientation carried out in an often dispersed number of practices and interventions within a seemingly flat space of water. The paper concludes that border transgressors’ act of moving by boat, with all of the losses involved, both challenge and potentially reorientate European mobility regimes.]

AB  - [Labor issues long have presented critical challenges for many writing center administrators (WCAs), who interrogate their "marginal" status with questions about how position type, education, oversight, responsibilities, resources, and support impact individual WCAs and writing centers as well as their research practices and production. Prior interview and survey research (Peterson, 1987; Olson & Ashton-Jones, 1988; Healy, 1995; Balester & McDonald, 2001; Driscoll & Wynn Perdue, 2012, 2014; Geller & Denny, 2013; Wynn Perdue & Driscoll, 2017) has represented some WCAs' perceptions of their institutional responsibilities and scholarly identity—often in relationship to other composition professionals—but WCAs have not been studied adequately on their own terms. To gain a systematic, comprehensive overview of WCA positions, this research uses problem-based and method-driven content analysis (Krippendorf, 2004) as well as corpus-based analysis (Kutter & Kantner, 2012) to analyze 395 unique WCA job ads from 2004-2014, aggregated from the WPA-L listserv archives, the Modern Language Association (MLA) job information list, and the Wcenter listserv. While frequencies, cross tabulations, and AntConc analyses of the ads yielded some trends and relationships about who is hired and under what conditions as well as about what they do, findings are more notable for what ads cannot tell readers about the WCA. More specifically, the gaps and omissions identified in the ads have critical implications for the ads themselves, the WCA described within them, and the future of writing center studies.]

To ensure that the accountants are adequately prepared to fulfill the tasks required by ongoing changes in the business world and advancement in technology, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) proposed changes to the uniform Certified Public Accounting (CPA) exam.
The draft was issued by AICPA first on June 4, 2015 and it was an Invitation to Comment (ITC) addressing all parties interested and impacted by changes on the uniform CPA exam. This paper is going to explain in detail the proposed changes; however, the main focus is the impact of these changes in the accounting curricula and how accounting educators can prepare students to fulfill these skills.

AU  - Agostinone-Wilson, Faith
AB  - Two contradictory phenomena are happening within media discourse. The first is the rapid rise of the Internet and social media, which has vastly increased the reach of ideas. At the same time, because of search tracking and the revenue models of social media such as click through ads, people are increasingly isolated within narrow thought collectives, only receiving information tailored to their indicated interests and viewpoints. Truth becomes more elusive, and not in a fun, playful postmodern way (DeVega, 2017). The interaction of these two aspects has shaped how people approach truth and reality, creating openings for those in power

AB  - [Foreign influence operations are an acknowledged threat to national security. Less understood is the data that enables that influence. This article argues that governments must recognize microtargeting—data informed individualized targeted advertising—and the current advertising economy as enabling and profiting from foreign and domestic information warfare being waged on its citizens. The Department of Defense must place greater emphasis on defending servicemembers’ digital privacy as a national security risk. Without the ability to defend this vulnerable attack space, our adversaries will continue to target it for exploitation.]

Against a turbulent backdrop of cascading environmental, economic and political crises, this is a century marked by accelerating migration to cities. Indeed, it is now predicted that, by 2050, two thirds of the total human population will live in them, a ratio that will have doubled in just 100 years (United Nations, 2014).

AB  - With the undeniable rise of variants of fascism in the United States and around the world, an up to date account of the logistics of antidemocratic mediations is urgent. Here as everywhere I take it as axiomatic that capitalism and democracy are structurally contradictory—both “capitalist democracy” and “democratic capitalism” are oxymorons. The strategic management of that contradiction by a system dedicated to conserving class power leads to what Walter Benjamin famously identified as the aestheticization of politics (“the processing of data in a fascist sense”), or what Orwell understood as a short-circuiting of thought (“doublethink”), and what some are

AB  - Alongside proposals for smart and sustainable cities, a number of DIY and participatory urbanism projects use digital technologies to generate new modes of urban engagement. As discussed in the last chapter, urban infrastructures are increasingly embedded with computational sensor technologies that are intended to automate urban processes and facilitate urban efficiencies. From tracking transport journeys and updating bus arrival times to traffic cameras and cycle-hire schemes—as well as monitoring air and water quality, river and sea levels, energy use, and waste—urban infrastructures, services, and functions are being remade or newly introduced through the sensor-actuator exchanges of digital urbanism.

For a moment after death, a player stares into her computer screen at her own corpse, her removed first-person perspective hovering over it, still attached to but disembodied from the avatar that allows her to experience the virtual space of the game. In this moment, the player knows she is dependent on that object, the body/corpse, that she has been forcibly separated from. The corpse’s existence is no longer fully dependent on the player.

After escaping late medieval persecutions and expulsions of Jews from imperial cities north of the Alps, and censorship against Hebrew books, the acquisition for the Catholic Augsburg merchant-collector Johann Jakob Fugger in Venice ca. 1549 saved it from subsequent Counter-Reformation confiscation or destruction in Italy. Yet, this entry into a Catholic collection irrevocably removed it from the environment

The interface to this popular software package is introduced with attention to features of interest in astronomy. An overview of the steps for generating models, textures, animations, camera work, and renders is outlined. An introduction is presented on the methodology for producing animations and graphics with a variety of astronomical data. Examples from subfields of astronomy with different kinds of data are shown with resources provided to members of the astronomical community. An example video showcasing the outlined principles and features is provided along with scripts and files for sample visualizations.

AB  - [ABSTRACT. This Special Feature Volume examines the potential value of the Systems Approach Framework (SAF) as a methodological framework for the transition to sustainable development in coastal zones. This article provides insight on the Systems Approach, the theory behind it, and how its practical application to coastal zone systems (CZSs) was developed. The SAF is about information for management through a focus on how to generate a higher, dynamic level of information about complex CZSs and how to render this information more useful to end users through a participatory suite of communication methods. The SAF is an open research methodology that investigates the function of systems in order to simulate specific issues or questions concerning their function. The research articles that are included in this Volume demonstrate examples of coupled multidisciplinary methods integrated into SAF simulations appropriate to a selected policy issue and to the social-environmental conditions of each Study Site Application. Their findings are not the result of funded research projects; instead, they are by-products of pilot applications conducted to develop and improve the SAF methodology. The final article of this Volume synthesizes these results in the context of the SAF as a higher level instrument for integrated coastal zone management.]

In this way, it will not be enough to evoke this idea, but rather we need to formulate a clear ontological model for it.

AB  - [High mountains have sensitive social-ecological systems (SESs) characterized by fragility, complexity, and marginality. The local economies of these environments mainly rely on primary production, tourism, and leisure activities; thus human–ecosystem interactions are intricately linked. Many authors stress that this strict relationship must be assisted with a participatory approach involving interested stakeholders in the conceptualization, specification, and synthesis of knowledge and experience into useable information for the express purpose of addressing a problem complex. This paper presents experience garnered with a participatory modeling framework combining hard and soft methodology in 2 case studies: the Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (Nepal) and the Central Karakoram National Park (Pakistan). The modeling framework was developed based on local stakeholders' demands and needs; it consists of 5 modules, briefly presented here along with their conceptual background. In developing the framework, particular emphasis was given to considering the needs of decision-makers at the local level, rather than simply providing technical solutions to abstract problems. From the development of this modeling process, a need emerged to structure a management-oriented research module in order to generate management knowledge that is both stakeholderrelevant and evidence-based. The application of the framework in the 2 cases studies showed that the modeling can trigger valuable discussion among stakeholders as well as guidance for management-oriented research and feedback loops ensuring validation of knowledge. In addition, the resulting scenarios can help decision-makers in defining pathways for sustainable development in mountain areas, where people's livelihoods are closely dependent on ecosystems. The framework was developed in such a way that it can be replicated in other mountain areas with similar challenges.]

In their theories of history, messianism, and cultural critique, Gershom Scholem, Franz Rosenzweig, and Siegfried Kracauer may not provide a systematic or unified answer to this question. But by returning to the project of negative mathematics that emerged in their work, I hope to show how the set of interdisciplinary tensions found there might shape theory today—theory, that is, that both draws on mathematics and remains rooted in

AB  - [Partial measurements of relative position are a relatively common event during the observation of visual binary stars. However, these observations are typically discarded when estimating the orbit of a visual pair. In this article we present a novel framework to characterize the orbits from a Bayesian standpoint, including partial observations of relative position as an input for the estimation of orbital parameters. Our aim is to formally incorporate the information contained in those partial measurements in a systematic way into the final inference. In the statistical literature, an imputation is defined as the replacement of a missing quantity with a plausible value. To compute posterior distributions of orbital parameters with partial observations, we propose a technique based on Markov chain Monte Carlo with multiple imputation. We present the methodology and test the algorithm with both synthetic and real observations, studying the effect of incorporating partial measurements in the parameter estimation. Our results suggest that the inclusion of partial measurements into the characterization of visual binaries may lead to a reduction in the uncertainty associated to each orbital element, in terms of a decrease in dispersion measures (such as the interquartile range) of the posterior distribution of relevant orbital parameters. The extent to which the uncertainty decreases after the incorporation of new data (either complete or partial) depends on how informative those newly incorporated measurements are. Quantifying the information contained in each measurement remains an open issue.]

To be square is to have certain parts or aspects — four lines of equal length connected at right angles — that are visually accessible and none of which is identical with squarehood. And to see something as being square is to see it as having these parts or aspects.  It is often supposed that colours are not thus visually complex. For example, I think we can take Locke to express this view when he mentions colours among the  simple <em>Ideas</em>; which being each in itself uncompounded, contains in it

TI  - Resilience Thinking and a Decision-Analytic Approach to Conservation
AU  - Johnson, Fred A.
AU  - Williams, B. Ken
AU  - Nichols, James D.
AB  - [ABSTRACT. There has been some tendency to view decision science and resilience theory as opposing approaches, or at least as contending perspectives, for natural resource management. Resilience proponents have been especially critical of optimization in decision science, at least for those cases where it is focused on the aggressive pursuit of efficiency. In general, optimization of resource systems is held to reduce spatial, temporal, or organizational heterogeneity that would otherwise limit efficiency, leading to homogenization of a system and making it less able to cope with unexpected changes or disturbances. For their part, decision analysts have been critical of resilience proponents for not providing much practical advice to decision makers. We believe a key source of tension between resilience thinking and application of decision science is the pursuit of efficiency in the latter (i.e., choosing the “best” management action or strategy option to maximize productivity of one or few resource components), vs. a desire in the former to keep options open (i.e., maintaining and enhancing diversity). It seems obvious, however, that with managed natural systems, there must be a principle by which to guide decision making, which at a minimum allows for a comparison of projected outcomes associated with decision alternatives. This is true even if the primary concern of decision making is the preservation of system resilience. We describe how a careful framing of conservation problems, especially in terms of management objectives and predictive models, can help reduce the purported tension between resilience thinking and decision analysis. In particular, objective setting in conservation problems needs to be more attuned to the dynamics of ecological systems and to the possibility of deep uncertainties that underlie the risk of unintended, if not irreversible, outcomes. Resilience thinking also leads to the suggestion that model development should focus more on process rather than pattern, on multiple scales of influence, and on phenomena that can create alternative stability regimes. Although we acknowledge the inherent difficulties in modeling ecological processes, we stress that formulation of useful models need not depend on a thorough mechanistic understanding or precise parameterization, assuming that uncertainty is acknowledged and treated in a systematic manner.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is a concept critical to managing social-ecological systems but whose implementation needs strengthening. Scenario planning is one approach that may offer benefits relevant to CBNRM but whose potential is not yet well understood. Therefore, we designed, trialed, and evaluated a scenario-planning method intended to support CBNRM in three cases, located in Colombia, Mexico, and Argentina. Implementing scenario planning was judged as worthwhile in all three cases, although aspects of it were challenging to facilitate. The benefits generated were relevant to strengthening CBNRM: encouraging the participation of local people and using their knowledge, enhanced consideration of and adaptation to future change, and supporting the development of systems thinking. Tracing exactly when and how these benefits arose was challenging, but two elements of the method seemed particularly useful. First, using a systematic approach to discuss how drivers of change may affect local social-ecological systems helped to foster systems thinking and identify connections between issues. Second, explicitly focusing on how to use and respond to scenarios helped identify specific practical activities, or “response options,” that would support CBNRM despite the pressures of future change. Discussions about response options also highlighted the need for support by other actors, e.g., policy groups: this raised the question of when and how other actors and other sources of knowledge should be involved in scenario planning, so as to encourage their buy-in to actions identified by the process. We suggest that other CBNRM initiatives may benefit from adapting and applying scenario planning. However, these initiatives should be carefully monitored because further research is required to understand how and when scenario-planning methods may produce benefits, as well as their strengths and weaknesses versus other methods.]

AB  - [Knowledge management (KM) has matured to the point that many organisations either believe they have such practices in place or at least understand they are relevant to the knowledge work commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from the literature, however, is a solid foundation for the philosophies underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit knowledge informs the KM space. Research over decades shows tacit knowledge underpins all other forms of knowledge, enabling the interpretation and judicious application of knowledge, leading (at its highest levels) to the concept of wisdom. As an academic discipline, artificial intelligence (AI) was established before KM, has been grounded in the computing discipline for many decades, and is applied broadly in many domains. This paper explores how AI can inform the KM debate. Rather than simply provide examples of AI success stories as applied to KM in practice, it explores the theoretical and practical limitations of AI and KM in unison, providing at the same time a strong epistemological understanding of both disciplines as a means of furthering the knowledge debate, with particular emphasis on the role of tacit knowledge within this jurisdiction.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. Complex environmental problem solving depends on cross-disciplinary collaboration among scientists. Collaborative research must be preceded by an exploratory phase of collective thinking that creates shared conceptual frameworks. Collective thinking, in a cross-disciplinary setting, depends on the facility with which collaborators are able to learn and understand each others’ perspectives. This paper applies three perspectives on learning to the problem of enabling cross-disciplinary collaboration: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, constructivism, and organizational learning. Application of learning frameworks to collaboration provides insights regarding receptive environments for collaboration, and processes that facilitate cross-disciplinary interactions. These environments and interactions need time to develop and require a long phase of idea generation preceding any focused research effort. The findings highlight that collaboration is itself a complex system of people, scientific theory, and tools that must be intentionally managed. Effective management of the system requires leaders who are facilitators and are capable of orchestrating effective environments and interactions.]

AB  - With the ever increasing pressure on agricultural and forested land for human activities, local municipality authorities are forced to re-think how to manage cultural heritage. The traditional mapping of cultural heritage in Norway was mainly based on chance discovery, and often with inaccurate positioning. Although some accurate and detailed cultural heritage mapping projects have been included recently, the national cultural heritage database is generally perceived as inadequate for planning land use. The development of airborne platforms for the retrieval of optical images has evolved significantly in recent years, and their use has proven helpful in the surveying and conservation of

AB  - Although the concept of predictivity in archaeology has an abundant literature, the theoretical framework is, surprisingly, still quite unexplored. In addition, it seems that prediction is often enclosed within a self-referential fence. Recently, some scholars have admitted the need to overcome the constraints of geostatistical tools settings (Kamermans 2013). Our proposal stands between enthusiastic, though sometimes uncritical use of geostatistical tools, and an outright rejection of them. They are helpful but they are just tools. We think that the historical question is the first, indisputable stage, and the historical interpretation is the end of the process. Here we describe in

Professor Garfinkel and his students performed a series of “breaching experiments” in which conventional social orders were interrupted; the consequences of those breachings were then examined in order to investigate the mechanisms by which social order was reconstituted.  The goal of the original Garfinkeling studies was to investigate assumptions in prevailing sociological theory—for example, functionalism¹—that maintained social groups operated according to universal laws and norms.

And, currently, there is little doubt about the importance of fiction and narrative in contemporary society. The importance of the horse and the importance of narrative fiction, however, are on similar and diminishing trajectories.

Academic electroacoustic music, and specifically acousmatic music, the modernist lineage that came to prominence from the 1970s in universities in the UK, Canada and Europe, has been both hegemonic and waning for around twenty years. Two influential articles bookend this period, announcing transitions ‘beyond the acousmatic’ and towards ‘post-acousmatic practice’, and attesting to this curiously slow fade (Adkins, Scott et al. 2016; Waters 2000). This chapter explores this state of affairs through an ethnography of British university trainings in digital art music and related scenes.¹

AB  - The early 2000s witnessed the flourishing of new terms and phrases, which frequently happens when societal and technological changes come together, and journalists and scholars are rushing to describe and explain them. The Internet, the web, mobile computing, crowdsourcing, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science are but a few of the terms that emerged from this flurry, and while some of the terms fell out of favour (such as cyberspace or neogeography), others proved enduring. The intersection between two of these terms – VGI and citizen science – is at the centre of this book and forms a distinct

AB  - For many, the content of console and computer-based videogames, as well as games played on smartphones and tablets, can offer a first encounter with past cultures and peoples. This extends to experiences of the ancient world, including Hadrian’s Wall and its sites, with the result that a digital encounter with the past will often precede an actual visit to a site. This trend has become more pronounced in recent years due to changing perceptions linked to global issues, such as environmental concerns. As a response, heritage sites have been working extensively on developing their digital profiles, including exploring the role

Apple’s iconic ‘1984’ commercial was a good example, showcasing that their new Macintosh computer could liberate human subjectivities from the tyranny of Big Brother. However, more than 30 years later, when the iPhone turns ten years old in 2017, we look back and see a very different, even opposite picture: digital objects such as smartphones have not only failed to deliver their emancipatory promise (Qiu 2016a), but have created instead new conditions of enslavement, so much so that I would contend

In her films this does not come across as mere affectation (a charge that has justifiably been leveled at a number of “quirky, offbeat,” and therefore generic, “indie” films) because the surrealism is set to work on defamiliarizing the quotidian or even banal (consider the ingenious way she uses screens, from that of a computer to a car window, as a technique for distanciation rather than as a window onto the world).

AU  - Tombrello, Thomas A.
AB  - Interview in nine sessions (December 26–December 31, 2010) with Thomas A. Tombrello, the Robert H. Goddard Professor of Physics, Caltech.  Each session is organized around a central topic or theme:  (1) early years through college, (2) fifty-year career overview, (3) undergraduate students,  (4) Kellogg Radiation Laboratory years, (5) work with Schlumberger research laboratory, (6) Caltech people and personalities, (7) work with national weapons laboratories, (8) ten-year tenure (1998–2008) as chair of Caltech’s Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, and (9) graduate students and miscellaneous topics.  

Tombrello opens with his family history, youth, early life, and education, primarily in Texas and Alabama, and his undergraduate (BA 1958) and graduate (PhD 1961) years at Rice Institute.  He talks at length about his years in Caltech’s Kellogg Radiation Laboratory, including his research into nuclear physics, materials science, and applied physics, and about the science, culture, people, personalities, politics, and economics of Kellogg and the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (PMA) over fifty years.  There is extensive discussion of his mentoring work with Caltech undergraduate and graduate students, including his innovative undergraduate course Physics 11 and his perspectives on student life at Caltech.  Of particular note is the discussion of his relationship with S. E. Koonin, who went from being Tombrello’s undergraduate advisee to his provost.  Tombrello provides a wide-ranging, in-depth look at his ten years as division chair of PMA, covering research, recruitment, fundraising, collegial relationships within and beyond the division and with JPL, and the evolution of PMA under his oversight.  He talks about his involvement in the design and construction of the Cahill Center for Astrophysics (dedicated in 2009) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project.  He describes his interactions with five decades of Caltech presidents and provosts, institute trustees, and various donors.

Tombrello recaps his two years as research director at Schlumberger research and his several decades of consulting work on weapons, national security, energy, and climate change issues at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.  He talks about his foray into earthquake prediction research, his research collaborations in China, his years as Caltech’s technology assessment officer, and the emergence of entrepreneurism at Caltech in the 1990s.  Anecdotes and recollections of such notable Caltech figures as R. Bacher, J. Benton, H. Brown, L. DuBridge, R. Feynman, W. A. Fowler, M. Gell-Mann, B. Kamb A. Lange, C. Lauritsen, T. Lauritsen, R.

AB  - Traditionally, machines assisting in the construction of architecture or the fabrication of building components stand on the ground. A crane, for example, requires a solid base to mechanically lift, lower and move material. The arm of an industrial robot or the linear tracks of a CNC machine ensure precision through a mechanical connection of movable parts with the surroundings. Mobile construction devices, such as a truck-mounted crane or locomotive robot,¹ extend the working range, but still need solid fixation to the ground when building. Recent developments in sensing, computation and control, however, allow the creation of autonomous construction machines with

TI  - Women’s Emancipation through Education: A Macroeconomic Analysis
AU  - Rendall, Michelle
AU  - Guvenen, Fatih
AU  - Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Research Department
AB  - In this paper, we study the role of education as insurance against a bad marriage. Historically, due to disparities in earning power and education across genders, married women often found themselves in an economically vulnerable position, and had to suffer one of two fates in a bad marriage: either they get divorced (assuming it is available) and struggle as low-income single mothers, or they remain trapped in the marriage. In both cases, education can provide a route to emancipation for women. To investigate this idea, we build and estimate an equilibrium search model with education, marriage/divorce/remarriage, and household labor supply decisions. A key feature of the model is that women bear a larger share of the divorce burden, mainly because they are more closely tied to their children relative to men. Our focus on education is motivated by the fact that divorce laws typically allow spouses to keep the future returns from their human capital upon divorce (unlike their physical assets), making education a good insurance against divorce risk. However, as women further their education, the earnings gap between spouses shrinks, leading to more unstable marriages and, in turn, further increasing demand for education. The framework generates powerful amplification mechanisms, which lead to a large rise in divorce rates and a decline in marriage rates (similar to those observed in the US data) from relatively modest exogenous driving forces. Further, in the model, women overtake men in college attainment during the 1990s, a feature of the data that has proved challenging to explain. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that the divorce law reform of the 1970s played an important role in all of these trends, explaining more than one-quarter of college attainment rate of women post-1970s and one-half of the rise in labor supply for married women.

Arenas of such engagement include machinima production (Lowood 2008), fan art, fan fiction, and the development of knowledge bases such as Thottbot that compile game statistics and player commentary. These activities are not unique to <em>WoW;</em> they connect to a larger movement fostering user-generated content (see Kucklich 2004; Jenkins 2006; Pearce 2006; Yee 2006; Postigo 2007; Ito 2008; Kendall 2008).

The uneven distribution and rollout of vaccines and the various digitally mediated measures for surveillance shaped by nation-state logics of division and demarcation are fitting reminders of the distances, degrees of separation, and unequal access to life and death that colonialism continues to mete out and the intricate power struggles that the contemporary moment has exacerbated.  This year has also made visible—in mainstream media representation and online social media discourse—a state-led and institutionally sanctioned backlash to last year’s Black Lives Matter protests in the

However, the library is extraordinary. The library is the entirety of the universe. Composed of an infinite number of hexagonal pillars, each of which contains five shelves of thirty-two books, each of which is 410 pages in length, the library contains every work ever written and every work that could possibly exist. When the library is discovered, it triggers celebration and joy. Everything that could be

Embedded in its etymology there is also a geometrical dimension, that of a plane (cf. French: <em>plate</em>) – flat, even, leveled, two-dimensional.

Many academic libraries have carved out physical space where patrons can experiment with designing art installations or objects and use equipment such as 3D printers to prototype their ideas; these workshop spaces and creative laboratories are, in turn, inspired by the makerspaces where engineers and computer scientists come together to take things apart and put them back together in innovative ways. Working in such inventive spaces, whether in open laboratories or prototyping studios, people are finding innovation in using old circuits or tools in

AU  - Levet, Melvin
AB  - Interview with Caltech alumnus Melvin Levet, BS ’39, MS ’40, in two sessions on February 20, 2015.  With memories of Caltech that stretch back nearly eight decades, he describes growing up in Monterey Park, California, in the 1920s and 1930s, with “orange groves all over the place.”  He talks about his family background and youthful interests, his experiences during the Depression, and his decision to enroll at Caltech.  After a rocky start with the core curriculum, he thrived as a geology major, working with professors I. Campbell, H. Fraser, R. Jahns, and W. P. Popenoe.  He recalls the rigors of his daily commute between Monterey Park and campus; his enjoyment of his geology coursework and field work in Ensenada, Pala, and the Inyo mountains, as well as the Grand Canyon; and his participation in Caltech baseball, including winning the Institute’s Rawlings Trophy and captaining the varsity team.

After receiving his MS, also in geology, Levet married his high-school sweetheart, Perle Wilkins; and after Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the Army Air Force meteorology program, based first at UCLA and later at the University of Chicago.  He served as a weather officer, first stateside and then in the Pacific at every Headquarters 13th Air Force location (except Fiji)—South Pacific, South West Pacific, Asiatic Pacific and the Philippines.  He vividly recounts some of his wartime experiences, including island hopping in multiple aircraft, his introduction to “persistence forecasting,” visiting Tokyo following V-J Day, and “taking in stride” the experience of being aboard a B-17 lost in a typhoon over the East China Sea.  In the 1980s he and Perle returned twice to Guadalcanal with fellow veterans and their spouses. 

After the war, Levet spent 35 years with Standard Oil California (later Chevron) as a research geologist and manager with the company’s computer services department.  Beyond his career, he enjoyed hiking, backpacking, and other outdoor activities with his family; and in retirement he and Perle traveled extensively, including trips with the Caltech Alumni Association and Caltech Associates, led by, among others, geologist R. Sharp.  This oral history concludes with Levet’s account of his ongoing relationship with Caltech, his observations of how Caltech has changed since his undergraduate days and his reflections on the Institute’s impact on his life and career.

AB  - In recent years, several international events have provided the opportunity to reflect upon the history of archaeological computing as an autonomous discipline and to reassess its theoretical basis by reconsidering the earliest applications. A key clue of this historiographical approach can be found in the exponential growth of technology applied to archaeological documentation procedures, which at present strongly characterise this discipline, overshadowing in many cases past theoretical and methodological advances.  We can recall various attempts made in this direction. First, during the international Symposium held in Rome at the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 2008 that specifically addressed ‘The Birth

Wooden-wheeled wheelchairs. In the last century, the definition of a cyborg has of course deepened and broadened. Prosthetic limbs now contain computers that work with the living person’s brain, signaling the parts to move. Humans—part human, part machine—have always existed: <em>imago dei</em>

If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.” Every attempt to seize hold of what time is leads to <em>ekstasis</em>, or being outside of itself, which recursively extends to the indefinite.

AB  - In physics, diffraction describes the phenomenon occurring when a wave encounters an obstacle. In particular, the term is used to denote what happens when light waves bend around the corner of a slit. Experiments examining diffraction effects were an important moment in the history of physics, marking the passage from what was thought to be a strict division between wave phenomena and the behaviour of particles, to a more fluid concept of materiality. Exceeding this border suddenly brought together into one essence two substances that before were not only different but unrelated, incommensurate. A collision that produced an entirely new

AB  - [In the process of Chinese megacity suburbanization, central-city substandard housing is demolished. The government relocates residents to megacity peripheral relocatees' areas. So far, few studies have focused on captive transit riders and analyzed the dynamic points of interest (POI) accessibility by public transit compared to the private mode in these areas. To fill this gap, this study conducts a survey in Jinhexincheng, one of these areas in Shanghai, China; analyzes captive-transit riders with multiple models; and computes the dynamic modal accessibility gap (DMAG) of public transit and private travel mode using multi-source heterogeneous data. Results show that 71.77% of transit-rider samples acknowledge they "have no other choice and have to travel by transit." These captive transit riders are more often older, female, non-working, without a driving license, and with more complaints toward public transport. Subjective transit evaluation's ordinal regression models show that waiting time, speed, operating hours, and number of lines/stops contribute to the low transit subjective evaluation. These things should be given a high priority in transit improvement. As for the captive transit riders, transit's transfer and bicycle availability should be improved. Using big data analytics, a more fine-grained scale is brought in by computing a DMAG index. It shows a person mostly has a better POI accessibility by private mode for the 30-minute, real-travel-covered area for 24 hours of the average day. For the 60-minute, real-travel-covered area, public transit mostly has a better POI accessibility. This study supports transit planning and decision-making for megacity peripheral relocatees' areas using multi-source heterogeneous data analytics.]

Perhaps surprisingly, the view of cognition which has been dominant now for several decades views the transition to culture as having relatively modest effects. Here is why. According to the standard view, whenever there is intelligence, there is both representation and computation. Any kind of cognition-driven behavior beyond the simplest reflex-like reactions to the immediate surroundings requires computational operations on contentful internal representations.¹ Thus, memory-based navigation in for example both insects (Gallistel 1998) and rodents (Tolman

AB  - [As we approach the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era, several studies have emerged that aim to (1) characterize how the instruments will perform and (2) determine what atmospheric spectral features could theoretically be detected using transmission and emission spectroscopy. To some degree, all these studies have relied on modeling of JWST’s theoretical instrument noise. With under two years left until launch, it is imperative that the exoplanet community begins to digest and integrate these studies into their observing plans, as well as think about how to leverage the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to optimize JWST observations. To encourage this and to allow all members of the community access to JWST & HST noise simulations, we present here an open-source Python package and online interface for creating observation simulations of all observatory-supported timeseries spectroscopy modes. This noise simulator, called PandExo, relies on some aspects of Space Telescope Science Institute’s Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia.We describe PandExo and the formalism for computing noise sources for JWST. Then we benchmark PandExoʼs performance against each instrument team’s independently written noise simulator for JWST, and previous observations for HST. We find that PandExo is within 10% agreement for HST/WFC3 and for all JWST instruments.]

TI  - Double coupling
AU  - Manuel-Navarrete, David
AB  - [ABSTRACT. Social-ecological organization is a multidimensional phenomenon that combines material and symbolic processes. However, the coupling between social and ecological subsystem is often conceptualized as purely material, thus reducing the symbolic dimension to its behavioral and actionable expressions. In this paper I conceptualize social-ecological systems as doubly coupled. On the one hand, material expressions of socio-cultural processes affect and are affected by ecological dynamics. On the other hand, coupled social-ecological material dynamics are concurrently coupled with subjective dynamics via coding, decoding, personal experience, and human agency. This second coupling operates across two organizationally heterogeneous dimensions: material and symbolic. Although resilience thinking builds on the recognition of organizational asymmetry between living and nonliving systems, it has overlooked the equivalent asymmetry between ecological and socio-cultural subsystems. Three guiding concepts are proposed to formalize double coupling. The first one, social-ecological asymmetry, expands on past seminal work on ecological self-organization to incorporate reflexivity and subjectivity in social-ecological modeling. Organizational asymmetry is based in the distinction between social rules, which are symbolically produced and changed through human agents’ reflexivity and purpose, and biophysical rules, which are determined by functional relations between ecological components. The second guiding concept, conscious power, brings to the fore human agents’ distinctive capacity to produce our own subjective identity and the consequences of this capacity for social-ecological organization. The third concept, congruence between subjective and objective dynamics, redefines sustainability as contingent on congruent relations between material and symbolic processes. Social-ecological theories and analyses based on these three guiding concepts would support the integration of current structuralist-functionalist methods, which sufficiently and appropriately characterize ecological organization, with ethnographic and narrative methods exploring human intentionality, reflexivity, and biographical development.]

AB  - [BACKGROUND Demography is an inherently spatial science, yet the application of spatial data and methods to demographic research has tended to lag that of other disciplines. In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in adding a spatial perspective to demography. This sharp rise in interest has been driven in part by rapid advances in geospatial data, new technologies, and methods of analysis. OBJECTIVES We offer a brief introduction to four of the advanced spatial analytic methods: spatial econometrics, geographically weighted regression, multilevel modeling, and spatial pattern analysis. We look at both the methods used and the insights that can be gained by applying a spatial perspective to demographic processes and outcomes. To help illustrate these substantive insights, we introduce six papers that are included in a Special Collection on Spatial Demography. We close with some predictions for the future, as we anticipate that spatial thinking and the use of geospatial data, technology, and analytical methods will change how many demographers address important demographic research questions. CONCLUSION Many important demographic questions can be studied and framed using spatial approaches. This will become even more evident as changes in the volume, source, and form of available demographic data—much of it geocoded—further alter the data landscape, and ultimately the conceptual models and analytical methods used by demographers. This overview provides a brief introduction to a rapidly changing field.]

Many theorists consider both pattern and morphogenesis as emergent from processes of self-organization. In this light, they have garnered significant recent attention from complexity scientists, for example, physicist Philip Ball’s three-part series <em>Nature’s Patterns: A Tapestry in</em>

AB  - My understanding of technology and the ways it structures our lives has been shaped by my interdisciplinary academic training and my embodied experience as a nonaverage user of digital interfaces and personal electronics. Since the rise of personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s, the average user of computational technology has been imagined and studied as male, white, able-bodied, and a native speaker of English (Costanza-Chock 2020; Mulvin 2021). This fictional, “techno-chauvinist” idea mirrors the lack of diversity among web designers and software developers working across the tech industry (Broussard 2018).

One <em>line</em> is the basic gesture of a poem, says Robert Hass: not one word, but multiple words in context, words together signifying something.¹ Poetry is “<em>language</em>in a state of dreaming,” says Gérard Genette.² Or Julia Kristeva again: “Poetic discourse measures rhythm against the meaning of <em>language structure</em>.”³ In the tradition of the language poets, then, I see poetry as a form that explores the tension between signified meaning and material meaning present  a

AB  - Within the Digital Humanities, a new interest in space, spatial concepts and spatialisation has emerged in recent years. On the one hand, this can be understood as part of the broader <em>spatial turn</em> in the social sciences and humanities that for the last 30 or so years argued for a closer attention to space. Part of this argument is the assumption that the social sciences and humanities have a tradition of neglecting space over time (Massey 1992). At the same time, this engagement with space and spatial modes of questioning raises particular questions and challenges for Digital Humanities. These questions

AB  - [Studies have found that artificial intelligence (AI) bots and cookies automate fake news in zones of social conflict such as race, religion, gender, and class. In this background, this paper investigates whether fake news is automated with the social structure unique to India. The research collected campaigning activities of political parties and politicians on the Internet but was limited to a select number of Facebook profiles, websites, hashtags, and Twitter profiles during India’s 2014 and 2019 general elections. Politicians and political parties on Twitter, Facebook and other websites formed the contact points where empirical data were collected in the research design. By reviewing hashtags such as #Nationwantsrammandir; #NaamVaapsi; #RamMandir; #AntiNationals; #caste; and #Hindutva, as well as fake social media accounts; discussion forums; and profiles of followers of politicians, the paper corroborated that bots, AI, and trolls serve fake news in the conflict zones of India and some forces are using it to perpetuate social divisions based on caste, class, religion, gender, and region. This paper argues that automated social media accounts spread false information that likely polarizes social conflicts in India.]

Then there is the question as to where “film history” fits in this new world picture as well as how that place translates into the academic scheme of things. Because in the academy we have a new role for which we may not have been prepared. And what is that? We are tasked with theorizing a historical transition from our specialization to whatever

AB  - It has been said that the myths of our times are shaped by the technologies of myth-making. But what if this constant remediation of myths makes us forgetful of the nature of their constructions? In chapter 1, I sought to show how modulation builds upon the unmarking of white maleness, by making those dysselected from that framework hypervisible through acts of violence. However, positing the question of racism and racialization as one of visibility can flatten race to a seemingly natural, biological, and effectively epidermal question in a way that continues to rely on an imagined authenticity of racial representation.

In the conceptual history of internationalism, focus on Parliament is particularly pertinent in the British case, as the country has been one of the most active agents in the field of international cooperation while regarding Parliament as the forum of ideological debate.

Hence, organizations become important contexts that shape how algorithmic regimes unfold—in the focal organizational settings themselves and by the same token in society at large (see Jarke et al. and Egbert, in this volume).

As the Anthropocene confronts us with this question at a species scale, the intrepid few who have already lived it out offer one set of answers. The first aviators to take their plane into such a storm, off the coast of Galveston, Texas in 1943, recalled being “tossed about like a stick in a dog’s mouth.” A more recent hurricane hunter describes being battered by turbulence so punishing that it caused an engine to explode as his aircraft passed through the storm’s eyewall.

Think of the extreme precipitation events as experienced in Western Europe in the summer of 2021. A major consequence is an increased probability of floods, threatening human lives, disrupting economic activities and the environment. In climate change research, the concept of such risk is usually defined as the combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (Parry, 2007). This definition is currently universally accepted by policy makers and the public at large. Interestingly, some natural disaster historians argue that this perception of

In the wake of the Spanish Invasion of 1519, nearly all pre-Hispanic books and manuscripts were destroyed or lost, although fourteen survive today.

They aren’t often compared to mash-ups or parodies because they are a thoroughly mainstream music industry practice. Covers don’t surface in the legal conversation because there is a compulsory mechanical license to produce recordings of a composition and so they don’t tend to provoke lawsuits. However, it’s precisely because cover songs are so normalized that I begin the book here: they do rework their source texts, and how that happens—and how it’s received—tells us a lot about popular beliefs around music, unmuddied by the

This piece examines the construction of the Latino/a/x Issues Conference (LIC) archive at Bowling Green State University (BGSU), a public university in rural Northwest Ohio. This article, from the perspective of the archivist, explores the following research questions: How can DH archival projects reveal and preserve invisibilized histories of Latinx students at public universities against a series of constraints and serve as a means of (re) producing latinidad? This case study explores how to utilize the traditional form of the DH digital archive to document and preserve latinidad in institutional archives and advances the notion of digital archiving as a form of first-aid care to address the historical erasure of Latinx communities in institutional archival contexts. In doing so, this article critically examines the process of archiving the BGSU LIC as a means to consider the possibilities and limits of archival intervention, the production and preservation of memory, and the challenges and affordances of descriptive infrastructures that underlie archival work.]

To understand how deeply embedded colonial history is in our institutions, it is important to understand its history. Although decolonising museum practice seems a topic emerging only in recent years, in the Dutch museum world as well in other regions, ethnographic museums have a much longer history of critically reflecting upon their colonial pasts and museological practices.

AB  - According to empirical research and theoretical and methodological arguments especially from childhood studies (James, Jenks, & Prout, 1998; Corsaro, 2018) we should consider children as agents. From the point of view of culture, this means they are persons capable of contributing to culture in their families and communities. The development of this view in the research community is parallel with the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child from 1989 and is part of the same intellectual current.² Moreover, research about infants’ cognitive and communicative capacities from the late 20th and early 21st centuries has

This is not an exhaustive survey of coding practices – that would require several volumes in its own right – but rather my goal is to draw attention to some points where operationalising the framework is especially important, as well as to existing approaches that could contribute to digisprudential legitimacy.

AU  - de Wit, Matthieu
AU  - Matheson, H. E.
AB  - Mainstream cognitive neuroscience aims to build mechanistic explanations of behavior by mapping abilities described at the organismal level via the subpersonal level of computation onto specific brain networks. We provide an integrative review of these commitments and their mismatch with empirical research findings. Context-dependent neural tuning, neural reuse, degeneracy, plasticity, functional recovery, and the neural correlates of enculturated skills each show that there is a lack of stable mappings between organismal, computational, and neural levels of analysis. We furthermore highlight recent research suggesting that task context at the organismal level determines the dynamic parcellation of functional components at the neural level. Such instability prevents the establishment of specific computational descriptions of neural function, which remains a central goal of many brain mappers – including those who are sympathetic to the notion of many-to-many mappings between organismal and neural levels. This between-level instability presents a deep epistemological challenge and requires a reorientation of methodological and theoretical commitments within cognitive neuroscience. We demonstrate the need for change to brain mapping efforts in the face of instability if cognitive neuroscience is to maintain its central goal of constructing computational mechanistic explanations of behavior; we show that such explanations must be contextual at all levels.

The server plays host to the client’s commands, setting up two distinct operations. On the one hand, the client demands a certain response from the server. On the other hand, the server is necessary, even vital, for the client’s functionality. A common problem for this type of computing model is that the centralization of

TI  - The Rationalization of Leisure
AU  - Weinberg, Lindsay
AB  - [Critical analyses of domestic technological culture have emphasized the impact of domestic technologies on intensifying women’s labor and reinforcing its privatization within the home, all the while being marketed as laborsaving devices. Drawing from the ways the marketing of domestic technologies framed the home as a space in need of technological administration, this article offers a Marxist feminist analysis of online surveillance during leisure time, examining how the marketing of technologies for both domestic labor and online leisure helps produce relationships between subjects and technologies that double as vehicles for capital accumulation. The article argues that we should look to the history of domestic technological design to understand the ways online surveillance and data collection are used to produce revenue and impact consumer behavior, given that both domestic technologies and contemporary information technologies work to rationalize non-waged time. The article begins with the Taylorization of the home popularized in 1912, followed by the rise of domestic technologies in the 1950s, in order to demonstrate how the ideological framing of the home as a space in need of rationalization informs the marketing of today’s personalization technologies. The marketing of personalization technologies reproduces the racialized and gendered logic of machine subordination that framed domestic technologies for the home in the 20th century. The article concludes with a discussion of how Marxist feminism is a useful theoretical framework for understanding and developing a political response to online data collection, given that both the domestic sphere and online leisure time are traditionally understood to be outside the workday, and therefore supposedly outside the scope of capitalist workplace relations of surveillance and exploitation.]

TI  - Methods for Exploring Indeterminate Textuality in John Cage’s Practices of Bibliographic Encoding
AU  - Lischer-Katz, Zack
AB  - [The increasing ubiquity of algorithmically mediated digital texts continues to generate debate about the instability and indeterminacy of texts. The American composer John Cage is well known for disrupting traditional Western aesthetics by incorporating chance operations, algorithms, and indeterminacy into his musical compositions and literary texts. This article analyzes materials found in the pre-print archive of Cage’s printed book, M (published in 1973 by Wesleyan University Press), in order to understand how Cage brought his aesthetic of indeterminacy into print. Through analysis of archival materials, it is argued that Cage exercised control over the performance and reading of his texts, even as he ceded authorial control to the aleatory processes of the I Ching—the ancient Chinese book of divination—and to the arbitrary choices of the typesetter/printer. This article offers new understanding about algorithms and indeterminacy in the performance of bibliographic codes.]

AU  - Trettien, Whitney
AB  - [The rise of digital technologies in the 1980s led to the development of new formalist frameworks, as scholars tried to identify what distinguished so-called “new media” from all that came before it. Tracing this history across textual and media studies, I show how this formalism catalyzed the desire for more comparative histories of media even as it increased misunderstandings across fields. I then introduce and define four words that cut across textual and media studies: substrate, platform, interface, and format. Together, these terms offer a shared, cross-disciplinary schema for describing the media technologies that store, transmit, and process human culture.]

The authors of the provocative <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em> (<em>LARB</em>) piece, “Neoliberal Tools (and Archives): A Political History of Digital Humanities,” take pains to explain that they are talking about not all of digital humanities, but a specific variety stemming from a particular tradition of textual studies and humanities computing.

AB  - [This study examined the student-level (i.e., gender, home language, and immigration status) and school-level (i.e., school economic disadvantage status) variability of the students’ affective mathematics engagement. It was hypothesized that there is a school effect that contributes toward explaining differences in affective mathematics engagement besides the student-level differences. For the sake of the nested structure of the data in Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we used the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) methodology. There were 10,221 students from 246 schools in the study. The results of this study explained 5.3% of variance in students’ affective mathematics engagement by school-mean economic disadvantage status, where students’ demographic factors explained 1.2%. The present study contributed to a better understanding of the opportunity to learn variables at the student- and school-level in students’ affective mathematics engagement.]

TI  - Industrial Landscapes Lost in the Wild: Creating a Methodology for the Remote Identification of Charcoal Hearths
AU  - Conner, Weston
AB  - This project examined industrial landscapes hidden within State Game Lands #217, near Palmerton, Pennsylvania. During the mid and late nineteenth century, extensive tracts of forests were felled and converted into charcoal to power iron furnaces. In the Lehigh Valley, this impact was felt on the Blue Mountain near two furnaces started by the Balliet family. This mountain remains covered in charcoal hearths, a testament to its past industrial use. This project developed a methodology for remote identification of charcoal hearths utilizing QGIS and LiDAR data, alongside multiple rounds of systematic pedestrian survey to ground-truth potential hearths. Special attention was given to hearths located on flat spaces, which were more difficult to identify. Through this survey and methodology, the hidden industrial landscape of State Game Lands #217 came to be better understood and its current perception problematized.

Using new platforms and networked environments, humanists entering the digital arena learned a great deal from the encounter. Expressed succinctly, the tasks of creating metadata, doing markup, and making classification schemes or information architectures forced humanists to make explicit many assumptions often left implicit in our work. Humanities content met digital methods and created projects in which the terms of production were, necessarily, set by technological restraints. (The forms

Yet increasingly, social scientists and policy makers alike seem to recognize that not only are these events <em>unforeseen</em>, but they also are <em>unforeseeable</em>, a point that chaos theory has demonstrated (Lorenz 1963; Saperstein 1997). Hayek’s speech emphasized this very point. Although

AB  - As a child, I saw Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: <em>A Space Odyssey</em> at the cinema. I was captivated by so many aspects of it—the moon base, the idea of life from other planets, the self-aware computer HAL, the cryptic scene at the end—and the magnificent technology. In 33 years time we would commute to a space station, in a Pan American passenger craft, and then on to the moon. Well, 2001 has come and gone, Pan American went bankrupt, and we are almost no closer to commuting to the moon now than we were four years after <em>2001</em> was

AB  - Architects, engineers, and the construction sector have been implementing various digital technologies over the last four decades, in the meanwhile resulting in infrastructures of design and construction. Recently, algorithms and their socio-technical environments have entered many physical and material aspects of life, including the production of architecture, construction, and the built environment, thereby giving rise to a new algorithmic regime. One approach that corresponds to this algorithmic regime is computational design, an umbrella term for the combination of various digital and computational methods, software, and technologies, typically based on data, code, algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI), deployed for calculating geometry,

AB  - Abstract Since genetic criticism regards modern manuscripts as a research object in and of itself, it objects to an editorial practice that treats manuscript studies as a mere tool towards the making of a scholarly edition. Still, an exchange of ideas between genetic criticism and scholarly editing can be mutually beneficial and may work in two directions. This essay therefore starts from digital scholarly editing, more specifically from recent developments in computer-assisted collation of multiple draft versions, to see how it can contribute to the study of modern manuscripts. The argument is that the combination of textual scholarship and genetic criticism can be an effective instrument for literary critics, enabling them to study the material aspect of the writing process as an inherent part of what cognitive philosophy calls &#x201c;the extended mind&#x201d;; and that this extensiveness does not only apply to the writer's mind, but that an awareness of manuscripts as a crucial part of the &#x201c;stuff of fiction&#x201d; can also contribute to a better understanding of literary evocations of the fictional mind.

The American Voices Project (AVP)—a widely watched experiment with this new platform—provides important early evidence on its promise. The articles in this issue reveal that, although public-use interview datasets obviously cannot meet all research needs, they do provide new opportunities to study small or hidden populations, new or emerging social problems, reactions to ongoing social crises, submerged values and attitudes, and many other aspects of American life. We conclude that a permanent AVP platform would help build an “open science” form of qualitative research that complements—rather than replaces—the existing very important body of immersive-interviewing research.]

Additionally, the moderating role of government scientific infrastructure and capabilities is investigated. A comprehensive survey was administered to participants within the government science sector in Indonesia, encompassing diverse demographics and scientific disciplines. Results reveal a significant positive association between transparent government communication policies and innovation resilience, highlighting the pivotal role of effective communication in fostering adaptability. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of government initiatives in building digital literacy and skills among researchers. The positive impact of communication policies on digital capabilities emphasizes the need for proactive strategies to enhance workforce proficiency in a technologically dynamic environment. The conceptual framework, validated through empirical findings, introduces the central construct of innovation resilience in government science, emphasizing adaptability to disruptive changes and consistent innovation.]

One of them, which this volume represents, explores what forms of knowledge might be constructed when creative writing encounters science. Working outwards from a theoretical framework that sees the sciences as discourses constructed by human endeavour through forms of language and practices of authority, it becomes possible to ask what forms of writing might emerge through scientific encounters. This is not so much a question of genre as it is a question about the relationship between creativity and scientific experiment, between the languages deployed by scientists in their experiments

AB  - [Subjective walkability is a measure of the perceived friendliness of walking in an area. Though subjective walkability is less commonly assessed than objective measurements, the latter often fail to reflect the experience of walking. This study aims to better understand subjective walkability and how it varies between travel and leisure walking by investigating its relationship with the built environment and land-use characteristics. Data is collected from 848 street segments in Montreal, Canada, using the MAPS-mini audit tool, external measurements including Walkscore as well as synthetic subjective walkability scores. Mixed effect multilevel models are then generated using travel and leisure subjective walkability scores as dependent variables and built environment features as independent variables. Statistically significant positive predictors of perceived walkability differ between walking for travel and walking for leisure. Walkscore is found to have a weak but significant effect on perceived walkability for travel but no effect at all for leisure. Based on this research, a multi-scalar approach both at the street and neighborhood level making use of a combination of objective and subjective walkability measures should be employed to study predictors of walking behavior. Lastly, distinctions of walking behaviors based on trip purpose should be integrated in future research.]

Drawing on the large-scale, nationally representative American Voices Project data, the article uses computational methods to test patterns in agentic expression and qualitative methods to examine how respondents narrate agency and passivity as they describe their lives. This analysis captures agentic moments, widespread narratives through which people emphasize their agentic selfhood as they recount specific situations. Moreover, individuals use narrative moves—such as shifting their focus and drawing on subtypes of agency—to craft agentic moments despite constraints. We argue that narratives of agency are variable, situational, and often co-occurring with narrative passivity, which enables people to narrate themselves as agentic even in challenging situations.]

The thirty-three-minute video tells the story of two undocumented migrants living in Norway with whom Achiampong and Blandy collaborated.² The narrators speak of staying in reception centers in Norway and detention centers in Iran, trying to obtain passports and work permits, and receiving threats of

Although there are several 3D modelling technologies widely used by archaeologists and historians, this text will focus on one particular approach, Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, and one specific application, ancient

AB  - [Caring for the young and the old, the fragile and the ill, is central to human thriving, and has played a fundamental role in human evolution. Yet care has been largely invisible in political economy and it does not fit the prevailing philosophical, political, and economic frameworks. Care typically emerges in the context of close personal relationships, and it is not well suited to either utilitarian or Kantian accounts of morality, or to “social contract” accounts of cooperation. Markets and states both have difficulty providing and supporting care, and as a result, care is overlooked and undervalued. I sketch alternative ways of thinking about the morality and politics of care and present alternative policies that could help support carers and those they care for.]

The term first appeared in <em>PC Week</em> in 1988, which explained that “everybody has only one killer application. The secretary has a word processor.

AB  - Communication research has traditionally focused on interpersonal, computer-mediated, and mass communication. All these types of communication deal with communication between at least two humans (Guzman, 2018). In recent years, however, machines have become sophisticated enough to engage in meaningful communication with humans (Hepp, 2020), not least because of groundbreaking developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Responding to a broader “non-human turn” in intellectual endeavours in the social sciences and humanities (Grusin, 2015), which gravitate away from a primary focus on exclusively human phenomena as research subjects, communication scholars have, therefore, started to embrace human–machine communication (HMC) as an

His approach to reading is based on a similar methodology: through specific close readings of carefully chosen poems, Bate demonstrates how poets such as William Wordsworth (1770–1850) (re-)wrote the British environmental narrative to prioritise individual responses to a natural world. In doing so, each poet — though in very different ways — sought to situate themselves as part of an ecosystem in which the

The lack of women in computing professions serves as a cause of social inequity and in this research we develop a nuanced understanding of the experiences of women participating in open-source software. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with eleven women representing multiple countries and a variety of open-source software projects. The theory of individual differences in gender and information technology (IT) laid the foundation for data analysis and interpretation. The results demonstrate varied experiences of women, the need for women-to-women mentoring, and the need for presence and enforcement of codes of conduct in the online communities. Women shared their experiences of working in a variety of roles and the importance of all the roles in product development and maintenance. The persistence of women in OSS communities despite the toxic masculine culture, and their interest in improving the environment for other women and marginalized newcomers, was evident from the interviews.]

Smith’s Orleans (2013) with a focus on how, in the face of profound environmental challenges, stereotypical narratives of heroism are transformed—like in a compost pile—through cyborg-elements. The essay argues that grounding hero stories in the techno-organismal entanglements of ecosystemic crisis, yields an explicitly instable, corporeal conception of heroism in/of crisis of eco-heroism. Reading Smith’s protagonists, Fen and Daniel, as eco-heroic cyborgs in conjunction with ideals of the traditional hero’s corporeal and affective superiority creates instances of hopeful heroics in the narrative that challenge supposedly stabilizing patterns of identification in traditional discourses of American heroism. This vision of cyborg eco-heroism in Orleans makes communicable an unpredictable and instable crisisstate, generating hope as a composted affect in this eco-heroic story of oddkin.]

AB  - Drawing has always had an implicit relationship to technology. While drawing is often framed as an instinctive and intuitive act, we should not forget that many of the principles we take for granted today were developed through technologies as much as through the hand. Alberti’s devices for perspectival drawing helped the artist manage the complexities of perspective and in turn assisted its proliferation as a representational mode. Piranesi’s<em>Carceri</em>were distributed as one might buy a contemporary mass-produced art print, the etching plate and the printing press working in combination. We might also think of tools like the pantograph as

These theatrical forms, scattered especially over the second volume of <em>AIC</em>, are a significant aspect of his writing style (as are his lists). Consider, for example, the section titled “Production of a Total Affect-Shame Bind by Apparently Innocuous and Well-Intentioned Parental Action” (2:228), which begins, “Our hero is a child who is destined to have every affect totally bound by shame.” Over two pages, Tomkins sketches an excruciating set of hypothetical scenes that take place around a

AB  - With the introduction of automation, computation and large-scale engineered timber, contemporary timber design and fabrication have evolved from earlier craft-based traditions. Projects have grown in scale and complexity with this evolution, facilitating new forms of building and uses for timber in architecture and construction. The complex nature of wood – a live and organic material – presents challenges for fabricators and designers, however, due to its tendency to change form in response to environmental and inherent factors. This is especially felt in the development and construction of large-scale, freeform timber buildings, where the performative demands of wood are much higher.

AB  - In order to manage the design-to-fabrication process of large-scale and complex architectural projects, Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) companies have been independently optimising custom in-house processes, as well as the delivery of data to external partners (Deutsch, 2017). These self-organised ways of improving workflows can take different shapes, depending on the company’s specific activities. For example, companies that conduct construction-related tasks and deal with large and complex datasets at late stages can be seen to primarily focus on developing tailored scripts based on existing software platforms (e.g. Design-to-Production, Front Inc., Woods Bagot) that curate the generated data from early to

AB  - We may tend to think of transactions as a binary exchange, a deal, a transfer of ownership, the fulfilment of an agreement or indeed an action that assures commitment. While such essential transactions occur in all fields of design, the nature of design transaction as channelled through building procurement has operated in the face of increasingly complex and often contradictory challenges. Regardless of any theoretical orthodoxy, built architectures of numerous creeds have emerged through – and often despite – the circumstances of boom-and-bust. Here we reflect on the notion of transaction through design as fundamental, both through the themes rooted

AB  - The computer enables a paradigm of design thinking, including processes and outcomes, that past methods of practice were unable to conceive. The emergence of computation in project delivery allows digitisation of material craft. It empowers the designer to simultaneously determine material, space, form and fabrication procedures. Through computational design rigour, each component can be digitally configured as a constructible part, creating new responsibilities for the designer to develop and manage fabrication with unprecedented involvement, commonly referred to as ‘direct-to-fabrication’. Where communication between an architect and contractor is conventionally facilitated through shop drawings as a confirmation of understanding and capacity to

Yet, we think of cyberattacks as only a technology problem, which are handled by smart computer network technicians capable of discovering a breach and developing patches to mitigate the problem. Certainly, technical solutions are a big part of cyber preparedness. But what if cyberattacks combine denial of services in cyberspace with targeted attacks on critical infrastructure, causing massive damage and loss of life in the physical world? This article will explore how federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private corporations, are using tabletop exercises, functional simulations and war gaming to prepare for significant cyberattacks. These programs examine how public and private sectors adapt to extreme cyber events. In a connected world, adaptive incident managers quickly form networks to exchange ideas, align core efforts and foster public communication.]

Also, archaeology growingly relies on computing technology to acquire, process, manage and share both raw data and their interpretations (for a critique, see Dallas 2007, 2015a, b; Huggett 1995, 2004, 2012). The typology and quality of technological devices available for recording on land and underwater have increased significantly in recent years. Due to constraints of the physical environment and the economies of the underwater work, underwater archaeology has always welcomed technological innovations.

At this early stage, leading thinkers in the field saw that the essential difference between the new digital machines and their analogue predecessors was something that needed to be discussed and so better understood.

As a graduate student at Stanford (PhD 1963), he specialized in nuclear engineering, working with Joel Ferziger.  In 1966, after three years at the RAND Corporation working on propulsion systems and fusion power, he returned to Stanford to teach nuclear engineering.  He moved to NASA’s Ames Research Center in 1973, working on computational fluid dynamics.  In 1985, he joined Caltech’s GALCIT as a professor of aeronautics, after a year there as a visiting professor.  He became von Kármán Professor in 2000 and Professor emeritus in 2005.  

In this interview, in addition to discussing his research, particularly on turbulence and vortices, and offering recollections of his GALCIT colleagues and students, he recalls his work on the Freshman Admissions Committee, the Administrative Committee on Supercomputers, the Academic Policies Committee, the Caltech Alumni Association, and the Caltech Y.

AB  - [ABSTRACT. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of research frameworks that emphasise the importance of understanding adaptive processes that happen at different levels. We contribute to this growing body of literature by exploring how cultural (mal) adaptive dynamics relate to multilevel social-ecological processes occurring at different scales, where the lower levels combine into new units with new organizations, functions, and emergent properties or collective behaviors. After a brief review of the concept of “cultural adaptation” from the perspective of cultural evolutionary theory, the core of the paper is constructed around the exploration of multilevel processes occurring at the temporal, spatial, social, and political scales. We do so by using insights from cultural evolutionary theory and by examining small-scale societies as case studies. In each section, we discuss the importance of the selected scale for understanding cultural adaptation and then present an example that illustrates how multilevel processes in the selected scale help explain observed patterns in the cultural adaptive process. The last section of the paper discusses the potential of modeling and computer simulation for studying multilevel processes in cultural adaptation. We conclude by highlighting how elements from cultural evolutionary theory might enrich the multilevel process discussion in resilience theory.]

AB  - [ABSTRACT. This paper shows how, with the aid of computer models developed in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to quantify and map how policy decisions are likely to affect multiple ecosystem services in future. In this way, potential trade-offs and complementarities between different ecosystem services can be identified, so that policies can be designed to avoid the worst trade-offs, and where possible, enhance multiple services. The paper brings together evidence from across the Rural Economy and Land Use Programme’s Sustainable Uplands project for the first time, with previously unpublished model outputs relating to runoff, agricultural suitability, biomass, heather cover, age, and utility for Red Grouse (Lagopus scotica), grass cover, and accompanying scenario narratives and video. Two contrasting scenarios, based on policies to extensify or intensify land management up to 2030, were developed through a combination of interviews and discussions during site visits with stakeholders, literature review, conceptual modeling, and process-based computer models, using the Dark Peak of the Peak District National Park in the UK as a case study. Where extensification leads to a significant reduction in managed burning and grazing or land abandonment, changes in vegetation type and structure could compromise a range of species that are important for conservation, while compromising provisioning services, amenity value, and increasing wildfire risk. However, where extensification leads to the restoration of peatlands damaged by former intensive management, there would be an increase in carbon sequestration and storage, with a number of cobenefits, which could counter the loss of habitats and species elsewhere in the landscape. In the second scenario, land use and management was significantly intensified to boost UK self-sufficiency in food. This would benefit certain provisioning services but would have negative consequences for carbon storage and water quality and would lead to a reduction in the abundance of certain species of conservation concern. The paper emphasizes the need for spatially explicit models that can track how ecosystem services might change over time, in response to policy or environmental drivers, and in response to the changing demands and preferences of society, which are far harder to anticipate. By developing such models in close collaboration with decision makers and other stakeholders, it is possible to depict scenarios of real concern to those who need to use the research findings. By engaging these collaborators with the research findings through film, it was possible to discuss adaptive options to minimize trade-offs and enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services under the very different future conditions depicted by each scenario. By preparing for as wide a range of futures as possible in this way, it may be possible for decision makers to act rapidly and effectively to protect and enhance the provision of ecosystem services in the face of unpredictable future change.]

Nevertheless, there is a tendency to emphasize known computable aspects of a problem while neglecting aspects that are unknown and failing to ask questions about them. The tendency to ignore the noncomputable can be countered by considering a wide range of perspectives, encouraging transparency with regard to conflicting viewpoints, stimulating a diversity of models, and managing for the emergence of new syntheses that reorganize fragmentary knowledge.]

AB  - [Abstract This article offers an alternative framework for understanding the sources of national security and power online. Wide-scale deployment of cyberweaponry regularly occurs beyond the scope of direct attacks on the infrastructure of national security and has a real effect on the power potential of states in the international system. Though the threat of cyberattack is a potent one, the greater impact on state power stems from the long-term disruption and distortion of the national innovation economy. The integration of civil and industrial functions with network systems allows for unprecedented levels of access to those second-order processes that underwrite national innovative potential and, ultimately, national power. A disruption to this underlying national apparatus via persistent, intrusive computer network exploitations (CNE) could diminish the innovative growth potential of sovereign actors in international affairs along several lines and essentially produce a power potential deficit that would not otherwise have existed.]

AU  - Todd, Peter M.

AB  - [BACKGROUND Many of the reproductive decisions that humans make happen without much planning or forethought, arising instead through the use of simple choice rules or heuristics that involve relatively little information and processing. Nonetheless, these heuristic-guided decisions are typically beneficial, owing to humans’ ecological rationality – the evolved fit between our constrained decision mechanisms and the adaptive problems we face. OBJECTIVE This paper reviews research on the ecological rationality of human decision making in the domain of reproduction, showing how fertility-related decisions are commonly made using various simple heuristics matched to the structure of the environment in which they are applied, rather than being made with information-hungry mechanisms based on optimization or rational economic choice. METHODS First, heuristics for sequential mate search are covered; these heuristics determine when to stop the process of mate search by deciding that a good-enough mate who is also mutually interested has been found, using a process of aspiration-level setting and assessing. These models are tested via computer simulation and comparison to demographic age-at-first-marriage data. Next, a heuristic process of feature-based mate comparison and choice is discussed, in which mate choices are determined by a simple process of feature-matching with relaxing standards over time. Parental investment heuristics used to divide resources among offspring are summarized. Finally, methods for testing the use of such mate choice heuristics in a specific population over time are then described.]

AB  - ABSTRACT.Exponential, de Vaucouleurs, and S&#xe9;rsic profiles are simple and successful models for fitting two-dimensional images of galaxies. One numerical issue encountered in this kind of fitting is the pixel rendering and convolution (or correlation) of the models with the telescope point-spread function (PSF); these operations are slow, and easy to get slightly wrong at small radii. Here we exploit the realization that these models can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a mixture (linear superposition) of two-dimensional Gaussians (MoGs). MoGs are fast to render and fast to affine-transform. Most importantly, if you have a MoG model for the pixel-convolved PSF, the PSF-convolved, affine-transformed galaxy models are themselves MoGs and therefore very fast to compute, integrate, and render precisely. We present worked examples that can be directly used in image fitting; we are using them ourselves. The MoG profiles we provide can be swapped in to replace the standard models in any image-fitting code; they sped up model fitting in our projects by an order of magnitude; they ought to make any code faster at essentially no cost in precision.

AB  - ABSTRACT.We present EXOFAST, a fast, robust suite of routines written in IDL that is designed to fit exoplanetary transits and radial velocity variations simultaneously or separately and characterize the parameter uncertainties and covariances with a differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We describe how our code incorporates both data sets to derive simultaneously stellar parameters along with the transit and RV parameters, resulting in more self-consistent results on an example fit of the discovery data of HAT-P-3b that is well-mixed in under 5&#xa0;minutes on a standard desktop computer. We describe in detail how our code works and outline ways in which the code can be extended to include additional effects or generalized for the characterization of other data sets&#x2014;including non-planetary data sets. We discuss the pros and cons of several common ways to parameterize eccentricity, highlight a subtle mistake in the implementation of MCMC that could bias the inferred eccentricity of intrinsically circular orbits to significantly non-zero results, discuss a problem with IDL&#x2019;s built-in random number generator in its application to large MCMC fits, and derive a method to analytically fit the linear and quadratic limb darkening coefficients of a planetary transit. Finally, we explain how we achieved improved accuracy and over a factor of 100 improvement in the execution time of the transit model calculation. Our entire source code, along with an easy-to-use online interface for several basic features of our transit and radial velocity fitting, are available online at http://astroutils.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/exofast.
